Section Navigation
Ensemble methods combine the predictions of several
base estimators built with a given learning algorithm in order to improve
generalizability / robustness over a single estimator.
Two very famous examples of ensemble methods are gradient-boosted trees and random forests.
More generally, ensemble models can be applied to any base learner beyond
trees, in averaging methods such as Bagging methods,
model stacking, or Voting, or in
boosting, as AdaBoost.
Gradient Tree Boosting
or Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT) is a generalization
of boosting to arbitrary differentiable loss functions, see the seminal work of
[Friedman2001]. GBDT is an excellent model for both regression and
classification, in particular for tabular data.
GradientBoostingClassifier vs HistGradientBoostingClassifier
Scikit-learn provides two implementations of gradient-boosted trees:
HistGradientBoostingClassifier vs
GradientBoostingClassifier for classification, and the
corresponding classes for regression. The former can be orders of
magnitude faster than the latter when the number of samples is
larger than tens of thousands of samples.
Missing values and categorical data are natively supported by the
Hist… version, removing the need for additional preprocessing such as
imputation.
GradientBoostingClassifier and
GradientBoostingRegressor might be preferred for small sample
sizes since binning may lead to split points that are too approximate
in this setting.
Scikit-learn 0.21 introduced two new implementations of
gradient boosted trees, namely HistGradientBoostingClassifier
and HistGradientBoostingRegressor, inspired by
LightGBM (See [LightGBM]).
These histogram-based estimators can be orders of magnitude faster
than GradientBoostingClassifier and
GradientBoostingRegressor when the number of samples is larger
than tens of thousands of samples.
They also have built-in support for missing values, which avoids the need
for an imputer.
These fast estimators first bin the input samples X into
integer-valued bins (typically 256 bins) which tremendously reduces the
number of splitting points to consider, and allows the algorithm to
leverage integer-based data structures (histograms) instead of relying on
sorted continuous values when building the trees. The API of these
estimators is slightly different, and some of the features from
GradientBoostingClassifier and GradientBoostingRegressor
are not yet supported, for instance some loss functions.
Examples
Partial Dependence and Individual Conditional Expectation Plots
Comparing Random Forests and Histogram Gradient Boosting models
Most of the parameters are unchanged from
GradientBoostingClassifier and GradientBoostingRegressor.
One exception is the max_iter parameter that replaces n_estimators, and
controls the number of iterations of the boosting process:
Available losses for regression are:
‘squared_error’, which is the default loss;
‘absolute_error’, which is less sensitive to outliers than the squared error;
‘gamma’, which is well suited to model strictly positive outcomes;
‘poisson’, which is well suited to model counts and frequencies;
‘quantile’, which allows for estimating a conditional quantile that can later
be used to obtain prediction intervals.
For classification, ‘log_loss’ is the only option. For binary classification
it uses the binary log loss, also known as binomial deviance or binary
cross-entropy. For n_classes >= 3, it uses the multi-class log loss function,
with multinomial deviance and categorical cross-entropy as alternative names.
The appropriate loss version is selected based on y passed to
fit.
The size of the trees can be controlled through the max_leaf_nodes,
max_depth, and min_samples_leaf parameters.
The number of bins used to bin the data is controlled with the max_bins
parameter. Using less bins acts as a form of regularization. It is generally
recommended to use as many bins as possible (255), which is the default.
The l2_regularization parameter acts as a regularizer for the loss function,
and corresponds to λ in the following expression (see equation (2)
in [XGBoost]):
It is important to notice that the loss term l(y^i,yi) describes
only half of the actual loss function except for the pinball loss and absolute
error.
The index k refers to the k-th tree in the ensemble of trees. In the
case of regression and binary classification, gradient boosting models grow one
tree per iteration, then k runs up to max_iter. In the case of
multiclass classification problems, the maximal value of the index k is
n_classes × max_iter.
If Tk denotes the number of leaves in the k-th tree, then wk
is a vector of length Tk, which contains the leaf values of the form w
= -sum_gradient / (sum_hessian + l2_regularization) (see equation (5) in
[XGBoost]).
The leaf values wk are derived by dividing the sum of the gradients of
the loss function by the combined sum of hessians. Adding the regularization to
the denominator penalizes the leaves with small hessians (flat regions),
resulting in smaller updates. Those wk values contribute then to the
model’s prediction for a given input that ends up in the corresponding leaf. The
final prediction is the sum of the base prediction and the contributions from
each tree. The result of that sum is then transformed by the inverse link
function depending on the choice of the loss function (see
Mathematical formulation).
Notice that the original paper [XGBoost] introduces a term γ∑kTk that penalizes the number of leaves (making it a smooth version of
max_leaf_nodes) not presented here as it is not implemented in scikit-learn;
whereas λ penalizes the magnitude of the individual tree
predictions before being rescaled by the learning rate, see
Shrinkage via learning rate.
Note that early-stopping is enabled by default if the number of samples is
larger than 10,000. The early-stopping behaviour is controlled via the
early_stopping, scoring, validation_fraction,
n_iter_no_change, and tol parameters. It is possible to early-stop
using an arbitrary scorer, or just the training or validation loss.
Note that for technical reasons, using a callable as a scorer is significantly slower
than using the loss. By default, early-stopping is performed if there are at least
10,000 samples in the training set, using the validation loss.
HistGradientBoostingClassifier and
HistGradientBoostingRegressor have built-in support for missing
values (NaNs).
During training, the tree grower learns at each split point whether samples
with missing values should go to the left or right child, based on the
potential gain. When predicting, samples with missing values are assigned to
the left or right child consequently:
When the missingness pattern is predictive, the splits can be performed on
whether the feature value is missing or not:
If no missing values were encountered for a given feature during training,
then samples with missing values are mapped to whichever child has the most
samples.
Examples
Features in Histogram Gradient Boosting Trees
HistGradientBoostingClassifier and
HistGradientBoostingRegressor support sample weights during
fit.
The following toy example demonstrates that samples with a sample weight of zero are ignored:
As you can see, the [1, 0] is comfortably classified as 1 since the first
two samples are ignored due to their sample weights.
Implementation detail: taking sample weights into account amounts to
multiplying the gradients (and the hessians) by the sample weights. Note that
the binning stage (specifically the quantiles computation) does not take the
weights into account.
HistGradientBoostingClassifier and
HistGradientBoostingRegressor have native support for categorical
features: they can consider splits on non-ordered, categorical data.
For datasets with categorical features, using the native categorical support
is often better than relying on one-hot encoding
(OneHotEncoder), because one-hot encoding
requires more tree depth to achieve equivalent splits. It is also usually
better to rely on the native categorical support rather than to treat
categorical features as continuous (ordinal), which happens for ordinal-encoded
categorical data, since categories are nominal quantities where order does not
matter.
To enable categorical support, a boolean mask can be passed to the
categorical_features parameter, indicating which feature is categorical. In
the following, the first feature will be treated as categorical and the
second feature as numerical:
Equivalently, one can pass a list of integers indicating the indices of the
categorical features:
When the input is a DataFrame, it is also possible to pass a list of column
names:
Finally, when the input is a DataFrame we can use
categorical_features="from_dtype" in which case all columns with a categorical
dtype will be treated as categorical features.
The cardinality of each categorical feature must be less than the max_bins
parameter. For an example using histogram-based gradient boosting on categorical
features, see
Categorical Feature Support in Gradient Boosting.
If there are missing values during training, the missing values will be
treated as a proper category. If there are no missing values during training,
then at prediction time, missing values are mapped to the child node that has
the most samples (just like for continuous features). When predicting,
categories that were not seen during fit time will be treated as missing
values.
The canonical way of considering categorical splits in a tree is to consider
all of the 2K−1−1 partitions, where K is the number of
categories. This can quickly become prohibitive when K is large.
Fortunately, since gradient boosting trees are always regression trees (even
for classification problems), there exists a faster strategy that can yield
equivalent splits. First, the categories of a feature are sorted according to
the variance of the target, for each category k. Once the categories are
sorted, one can consider continuous partitions, i.e. treat the categories
as if they were ordered continuous values (see Fisher [Fisher1958] for a
formal proof). As a result, only K−1 splits need to be considered
instead of 2K−1−1. The initial sorting is a
O(Klog⁡(K)) operation, leading to a total complexity of
O(Klog⁡(K)+K), instead of O(2K).
Examples
Categorical Feature Support in Gradient Boosting
Depending on the problem at hand, you may have prior knowledge indicating
that a given feature should in general have a positive (or negative) effect
on the target value. For example, all else being equal, a higher credit
score should increase the probability of getting approved for a loan.
Monotonic constraints allow you to incorporate such prior knowledge into the
model.
For a predictor F with two features:
a monotonic increase constraint is a constraint of the form:
a monotonic decrease constraint is a constraint of the form:
You can specify a monotonic constraint on each feature using the
monotonic_cst parameter. For each feature, a value of 0 indicates no
constraint, while 1 and -1 indicate a monotonic increase and
monotonic decrease constraint, respectively:
In a binary classification context, imposing a monotonic increase (decrease) constraint means that higher values of the feature are supposed
to have a positive (negative) effect on the probability of samples
to belong to the positive class.
Nevertheless, monotonic constraints only marginally constrain feature effects on the output.
For instance, monotonic increase and decrease constraints cannot be used to enforce the
following modelling constraint:
Also, monotonic constraints are not supported for multiclass classification.
For a practical implementation of monotonic constraints with the histogram-based
gradient boosting, including how they can improve generalization when domain knowledge
is available, see
Monotonic Constraints.
Note
Since categories are unordered quantities, it is not possible to enforce
monotonic constraints on categorical features.
Examples
Features in Histogram Gradient Boosting Trees
A priori, the histogram gradient boosted trees are allowed to use any feature
to split a node into child nodes. This creates so called interactions between
features, i.e. usage of different features as split along a branch. Sometimes,
one wants to restrict the possible interactions, see [Mayer2022]. This can be
done by the parameter interaction_cst, where one can specify the indices
of features that are allowed to interact.
For instance, with 3 features in total, interaction_cst=[{0}, {1}, {2}]
forbids all interactions.
The constraints [{0, 1}, {1, 2}] specify two groups of possibly
interacting features. Features 0 and 1 may interact with each other, as well
as features 1 and 2. But note that features 0 and 2 are forbidden to interact.
The following depicts a tree and the possible splits of the tree:
LightGBM uses the same logic for overlapping groups.
Note that features not listed in interaction_cst are automatically
assigned an interaction group for themselves. With again 3 features, this
means that [{0}] is equivalent to [{0}, {1, 2}].

HistGradientBoostingClassifier and
HistGradientBoostingRegressor use OpenMP
for parallelization through Cython. For more details on how to control the
number of threads, please refer to our Parallelism notes.
The following parts are parallelized:
mapping samples from real values to integer-valued bins (finding the bin
thresholds is however sequential)
building histograms is parallelized over features
finding the best split point at a node is parallelized over features
during fit, mapping samples into the left and right children is
parallelized over samples
gradient and hessians computations are parallelized over samples
predicting is parallelized over samples
The bottleneck of a gradient boosting procedure is building the decision
trees. Building a traditional decision tree (as in the other GBDTs
GradientBoostingClassifier and GradientBoostingRegressor)
requires sorting the samples at each node (for
each feature). Sorting is needed so that the potential gain of a split point
can be computed efficiently. Splitting a single node has thus a complexity
of O(nfeatures×nlog⁡(n)) where n
is the number of samples at the node.
HistGradientBoostingClassifier and
HistGradientBoostingRegressor, in contrast, do not require sorting the
feature values and instead use a data-structure called a histogram, where the
samples are implicitly ordered. Building a histogram has a
O(n) complexity, so the node splitting procedure has a
O(nfeatures×n) complexity, much smaller
than the previous one. In addition, instead of considering n split
points, we consider only max_bins split points, which might be much
smaller.
In order to build histograms, the input data X needs to be binned into
integer-valued bins. This binning procedure does require sorting the feature
values, but it only happens once at the very beginning of the boosting process
(not at each node, like in GradientBoostingClassifier and
GradientBoostingRegressor).
Finally, many parts of the implementation of
HistGradientBoostingClassifier and
HistGradientBoostingRegressor are parallelized.

The usage and the parameters of GradientBoostingClassifier and
GradientBoostingRegressor are described below. The 2 most important
parameters of these estimators are n_estimators and learning_rate.
GradientBoostingClassifier supports both binary and multi-class
classification.
The following example shows how to fit a gradient boosting classifier
with 100 decision stumps as weak learners:
The number of weak learners (i.e. regression trees) is controlled by the
parameter n_estimators; The size of each tree can be controlled either by setting the tree
depth via max_depth or by setting the number of leaf nodes via
max_leaf_nodes. The learning_rate is a hyper-parameter in the range
(0.0, 1.0] that controls overfitting via shrinkage .
Note
Classification with more than 2 classes requires the induction
of n_classes regression trees at each iteration,
thus, the total number of induced trees equals
n_classes * n_estimators. For datasets with a large number
of classes we strongly recommend to use
HistGradientBoostingClassifier as an alternative to
GradientBoostingClassifier .
GradientBoostingRegressor supports a number of
different loss functions
for regression which can be specified via the argument
loss; the default loss function for regression is squared error
('squared_error').
The figure below shows the results of applying GradientBoostingRegressor
with least squares loss and 500 base learners to the diabetes dataset
(sklearn.datasets.load_diabetes).
The plot shows the train and test error at each iteration.
The train error at each iteration is stored in the
train_score_ attribute of the gradient boosting model.
The test error at each iteration can be obtained
via the staged_predict method which returns a
generator that yields the predictions at each stage. Plots like these can be used
to determine the optimal number of trees (i.e. n_estimators) by early stopping.
Examples
Gradient Boosting regression
Gradient Boosting Out-of-Bag estimates
Both GradientBoostingRegressor and GradientBoostingClassifier
support warm_start=True which allows you to add more estimators to an already
fitted model.
The size of the regression tree base learners defines the level of variable
interactions that can be captured by the gradient boosting model. In general,
a tree of depth h can capture interactions of order h .
There are two ways in which the size of the individual regression trees can
be controlled.
If you specify max_depth=h then complete binary trees
of depth h will be grown. Such trees will have (at most) 2**h leaf nodes
and 2**h - 1 split nodes.
Alternatively, you can control the tree size by specifying the number of
leaf nodes via the parameter max_leaf_nodes. In this case,
trees will be grown using best-first search where nodes with the highest improvement
in impurity will be expanded first.
A tree with max_leaf_nodes=k has k - 1 split nodes and thus can
model interactions of up to order max_leaf_nodes - 1 .
We found that max_leaf_nodes=k gives comparable results to max_depth=k-1
but is significantly faster to train at the expense of a slightly higher
training error.
The parameter max_leaf_nodes corresponds to the variable J in the
chapter on gradient boosting in [Friedman2001] and is related to the parameter
interaction.depth in R’s gbm package where max_leaf_nodes == interaction.depth + 1 .
We first present GBRT for regression, and then detail the classification
case.
GBRT regressors are additive models whose prediction y^i for a
given input xi is of the following form:
where the hm are estimators called weak learners in the context
of boosting. Gradient Tree Boosting uses decision tree regressors of fixed size as weak learners. The constant M corresponds to the
n_estimators parameter.
Similar to other boosting algorithms, a GBRT is built in a greedy fashion:
where the newly added tree hm is fitted in order to minimize a sum
of losses Lm, given the previous ensemble Fm−1:
where l(yi,F(xi)) is defined by the loss parameter, detailed
in the next section.
By default, the initial model F0 is chosen as the constant that
minimizes the loss: for a least-squares loss, this is the empirical mean of
the target values. The initial model can also be specified via the init
argument.
Using a first-order Taylor approximation, the value of l can be
approximated as follows:
Note
Briefly, a first-order Taylor approximation says that
l(z)≈l(a)+(z−a)∂l∂z(a).
Here, z corresponds to Fm−1(xi)+hm(xi), and
a corresponds to Fm−1(xi)
The quantity [∂l(yi,F(xi))∂F(xi)]F=Fm−1 is the derivative of the loss with respect to its
second parameter, evaluated at Fm−1(x). It is easy to compute for
any given Fm−1(xi) in a closed form since the loss is
differentiable. We will denote it by gi.
Removing the constant terms, we have:
This is minimized if h(xi) is fitted to predict a value that is
proportional to the negative gradient −gi. Therefore, at each
iteration, the estimator hm is fitted to predict the negative
gradients of the samples. The gradients are updated at each iteration.
This can be considered as some kind of gradient descent in a functional
space.
Note
For some losses, e.g. 'absolute_error' where the gradients
are ±1, the values predicted by a fitted hm are not
accurate enough: the tree can only output integer values. As a result, the
leaves values of the tree hm are modified once the tree is
fitted, such that the leaves values minimize the loss Lm. The
update is loss-dependent: for the absolute error loss, the value of
a leaf is updated to the median of the samples in that leaf.
Gradient boosting for classification is very similar to the regression case.
However, the sum of the trees FM(xi)=∑mhm(xi) is not
homogeneous to a prediction: it cannot be a class, since the trees predict
continuous values.
The mapping from the value FM(xi) to a class or a probability is
loss-dependent. For the log-loss, the probability that
xi belongs to the positive class is modeled as p(yi=1|xi)=σ(FM(xi)) where σ is the sigmoid or expit function.
For multiclass classification, K trees (for K classes) are built at each of
the M iterations. The probability that xi belongs to class
k is modeled as a softmax of the FM,k(xi) values.
Note that even for a classification task, the hm sub-estimator is
still a regressor, not a classifier. This is because the sub-estimators are
trained to predict (negative) gradients, which are always continuous
quantities.
The following loss functions are supported and can be specified using
the parameter loss:
Squared error ('squared_error'): The natural choice for regression
due to its superior computational properties. The initial model is
given by the mean of the target values.
Absolute error ('absolute_error'): A robust loss function for
regression. The initial model is given by the median of the
target values.
Huber ('huber'): Another robust loss function that combines
least squares and least absolute deviation; use alpha to
control the sensitivity with regards to outliers (see [Friedman2001] for
more details).
Quantile ('quantile'): A loss function for quantile regression.
Use 0 < alpha < 1 to specify the quantile. This loss function
can be used to create prediction intervals
(see Prediction Intervals for Gradient Boosting Regression).
Binary log-loss ('log-loss'): The binomial
negative log-likelihood loss function for binary classification. It provides
probability estimates.  The initial model is given by the
log odds-ratio.
Multi-class log-loss ('log-loss'): The multinomial
negative log-likelihood loss function for multi-class classification with
n_classes mutually exclusive classes. It provides
probability estimates.  The initial model is given by the
prior probability of each class. At each iteration n_classes
regression trees have to be constructed which makes GBRT rather
inefficient for data sets with a large number of classes.
Exponential loss ('exponential'): The same loss function
as AdaBoostClassifier. Less robust to mislabeled
examples than 'log-loss'; can only be used for binary
classification.
[Friedman2001] proposed a simple regularization strategy that scales
the contribution of each weak learner by a constant factor ν:
The parameter ν is also called the learning rate because
it scales the step length of the gradient descent procedure; it can
be set via the learning_rate parameter.
The parameter learning_rate strongly interacts with the parameter
n_estimators, the number of weak learners to fit. Smaller values
of learning_rate require larger numbers of weak learners to maintain
a constant training error. Empirical evidence suggests that small
values of learning_rate favor better test error. [HTF]
recommend to set the learning rate to a small constant
(e.g. learning_rate <= 0.1) and choose n_estimators large enough
that early stopping applies,
see Early stopping in Gradient Boosting
for a more detailed discussion of the interaction between
learning_rate and n_estimators see [R2007].
[Friedman2002] proposed stochastic gradient boosting, which combines gradient
boosting with bootstrap averaging (bagging). At each iteration
the base classifier is trained on a fraction subsample of
the available training data. The subsample is drawn without replacement.
A typical value of subsample is 0.5.
The figure below illustrates the effect of shrinkage and subsampling
on the goodness-of-fit of the model. We can clearly see that shrinkage
outperforms no-shrinkage. Subsampling with shrinkage can further increase
the accuracy of the model. Subsampling without shrinkage, on the other hand,
does poorly.
Another strategy to reduce the variance is by subsampling the features
analogous to the random splits in RandomForestClassifier.
The number of subsampled features can be controlled via the max_features
parameter.
Note
Using a small max_features value can significantly decrease the runtime.
Stochastic gradient boosting allows to compute out-of-bag estimates of the
test deviance by computing the improvement in deviance on the examples that are
not included in the bootstrap sample (i.e. the out-of-bag examples).
The improvements are stored in the attribute oob_improvement_.
oob_improvement_[i] holds the improvement in terms of the loss on the OOB samples
if you add the i-th stage to the current predictions.
Out-of-bag estimates can be used for model selection, for example to determine
the optimal number of iterations. OOB estimates are usually very pessimistic thus
we recommend to use cross-validation instead and only use OOB if cross-validation
is too time consuming.

Individual decision trees can be interpreted easily by simply
visualizing the tree structure. Gradient boosting models, however,
comprise hundreds of regression trees thus they cannot be easily
interpreted by visual inspection of the individual trees. Fortunately,
a number of techniques have been proposed to summarize and interpret
gradient boosting models.
Often features do not contribute equally to predict the target
response; in many situations the majority of the features are in fact
irrelevant.
When interpreting a model, the first question usually is: what are
those important features and how do they contribute in predicting
the target response?
Individual decision trees intrinsically perform feature selection by selecting
appropriate split points. This information can be used to measure the
importance of each feature; the basic idea is: the more often a
feature is used in the split points of a tree the more important that
feature is. This notion of importance can be extended to decision tree
ensembles by simply averaging the impurity-based feature importance of each tree (see
Feature importance evaluation for more details).
The feature importance scores of a fit gradient boosting model can be
accessed via the feature_importances_ property:
Note that this computation of feature importance is based on entropy, and it
is distinct from sklearn.inspection.permutation_importance which is
based on permutation of the features.

The sklearn.ensemble module includes two averaging algorithms based
on randomized decision trees: the RandomForest algorithm
and the Extra-Trees method. Both algorithms are perturb-and-combine
techniques [B1998] specifically designed for trees. This means a diverse
set of classifiers is created by introducing randomness in the classifier
construction.  The prediction of the ensemble is given as the averaged
prediction of the individual classifiers.
As other classifiers, forest classifiers have to be fitted with two
arrays: a sparse or dense array X of shape (n_samples, n_features)
holding the training samples, and an array Y of shape (n_samples,)
holding the target values (class labels) for the training samples:
Like decision trees, forests of trees also extend to
multi-output problems  (if Y is an array
of shape (n_samples, n_outputs)).
In random forests (see RandomForestClassifier and
RandomForestRegressor classes), each tree in the ensemble is built
from a sample drawn with replacement (i.e., a bootstrap sample) from the
training set.
Furthermore, when splitting each node during the construction of a tree, the
best split is found through an exhaustive search of the feature values of
either all input features or a random subset of size max_features.
(See the parameter tuning guidelines for more details.)
The purpose of these two sources of randomness is to decrease the variance of
the forest estimator. Indeed, individual decision trees typically exhibit high
variance and tend to overfit. The injected randomness in forests yield decision
trees with somewhat decoupled prediction errors. By taking an average of those
predictions, some errors can cancel out. Random forests achieve a reduced
variance by combining diverse trees, sometimes at the cost of a slight increase
in bias. In practice the variance reduction is often significant hence yielding
an overall better model.
In contrast to the original publication [B2001], the scikit-learn
implementation combines classifiers by averaging their probabilistic
prediction, instead of letting each classifier vote for a single class.
A competitive alternative to random forests are
Histogram-Based Gradient Boosting (HGBT) models:
Building trees: Random forests typically rely on deep trees (that overfit
individually) which uses much computational resources, as they require
several splittings and evaluations of candidate splits. Boosting models
build shallow trees (that underfit individually) which are faster to fit
and predict.
Sequential boosting: In HGBT, the decision trees are built sequentially,
where each tree is trained to correct the errors made by the previous ones.
This allows them to iteratively improve the model’s performance using
relatively few trees. In contrast, random forests use a majority vote to
predict the outcome, which can require a larger number of trees to achieve
the same level of accuracy.
Efficient binning: HGBT uses an efficient binning algorithm that can handle
large datasets with a high number of features. The binning algorithm can
pre-process the data to speed up the subsequent tree construction (see
Why it’s faster). In contrast, the scikit-learn
implementation of random forests does not use binning and relies on exact
splitting, which can be computationally expensive.
Overall, the computational cost of HGBT versus RF depends on the specific
characteristics of the dataset and the modeling task. It’s a good idea
to try both models and compare their performance and computational efficiency
on your specific problem to determine which model is the best fit.
Examples
Comparing Random Forests and Histogram Gradient Boosting models
In extremely randomized trees (see ExtraTreesClassifier
and ExtraTreesRegressor classes), randomness goes one step
further in the way splits are computed. As in random forests, a random
subset of candidate features is used, but instead of looking for the
most discriminative thresholds, thresholds are drawn at random for each
candidate feature and the best of these randomly-generated thresholds is
picked as the splitting rule. This usually allows to reduce the variance
of the model a bit more, at the expense of a slightly greater increase
in bias:
The main parameters to adjust when using these methods is n_estimators and
max_features. The former is the number of trees in the forest. The larger
the better, but also the longer it will take to compute. In addition, note that
results will stop getting significantly better beyond a critical number of
trees. The latter is the size of the random subsets of features to consider
when splitting a node. The lower the greater the reduction of variance, but
also the greater the increase in bias. Empirical good default values are
max_features=1.0 or equivalently max_features=None (always considering
all features instead of a random subset) for regression problems, and
max_features="sqrt" (using a random subset of size sqrt(n_features))
for classification tasks (where n_features is the number of features in
the data). The default value of max_features=1.0 is equivalent to bagged
trees and more randomness can be achieved by setting smaller values (e.g. 0.3
is a typical default in the literature). Good results are often achieved when
setting max_depth=None in combination with min_samples_split=2 (i.e.,
when fully developing the trees). Bear in mind though that these values are
usually not optimal, and might result in models that consume a lot of RAM.
The best parameter values should always be cross-validated. In addition, note
that in random forests, bootstrap samples are used by default
(bootstrap=True) while the default strategy for extra-trees is to use the
whole dataset (bootstrap=False). When using bootstrap sampling the
generalization error can be estimated on the left out or out-of-bag samples.
This can be enabled by setting oob_score=True.
Note
The size of the model with the default parameters is O(M∗N∗log(N)),
where M is the number of trees and N is the number of samples.
In order to reduce the size of the model, you can change these parameters:
min_samples_split, max_leaf_nodes, max_depth and min_samples_leaf.
Finally, this module also features the parallel construction of the trees
and the parallel computation of the predictions through the n_jobs
parameter. If n_jobs=k then computations are partitioned into
k jobs, and run on k cores of the machine. If n_jobs=-1
then all cores available on the machine are used. Note that because of
inter-process communication overhead, the speedup might not be linear
(i.e., using k jobs will unfortunately not be k times as
fast). Significant speedup can still be achieved though when building
a large number of trees, or when building a single tree requires a fair
amount of time (e.g., on large datasets).

The relative rank (i.e. depth) of a feature used as a decision node in a
tree can be used to assess the relative importance of that feature with
respect to the predictability of the target variable. Features used at
the top of the tree contribute to the final prediction decision of a
larger fraction of the input samples. The expected fraction of the
samples they contribute to can thus be used as an estimate of the
relative importance of the features. In scikit-learn, the fraction of
samples a feature contributes to is combined with the decrease in impurity
from splitting them to create a normalized estimate of the predictive power
of that feature.
By averaging the estimates of predictive ability over several randomized
trees one can reduce the variance of such an estimate and use it
for feature selection. This is known as the mean decrease in impurity, or MDI.
Refer to [L2014] for more information on MDI and feature importance
evaluation with Random Forests.
Warning
The impurity-based feature importances computed on tree-based models suffer
from two flaws that can lead to misleading conclusions. First they are
computed on statistics derived from the training dataset and therefore do
not necessarily inform us on which features are most important to make good
predictions on held-out dataset. Secondly, they favor high cardinality
features, that is features with many unique values.
Permutation feature importance is an alternative to impurity-based feature
importance that does not suffer from these flaws. These two methods of
obtaining feature importance are explored in:
Permutation Importance vs Random Forest Feature Importance (MDI).
In practice those estimates are stored as an attribute named
feature_importances_ on the fitted model. This is an array with shape
(n_features,) whose values are positive and sum to 1.0. The higher
the value, the more important is the contribution of the matching feature
to the prediction function.

RandomTreesEmbedding implements an unsupervised transformation of the
data.  Using a forest of completely random trees, RandomTreesEmbedding
encodes the data by the indices of the leaves a data point ends up in.  This
index is then encoded in a one-of-K manner, leading to a high dimensional,
sparse binary coding.
This coding can be computed very efficiently and can then be used as a basis
for other learning tasks.
The size and sparsity of the code can be influenced by choosing the number of
trees and the maximum depth per tree. For each tree in the ensemble, the coding
contains one entry of one. The size of the coding is at most n_estimators * 2
** max_depth, the maximum number of leaves in the forest.
As neighboring data points are more likely to lie within the same leaf of a
tree, the transformation performs an implicit, non-parametric density
estimation.

dimensionality reduction techniques on handwritten digits.
Feature transformations with ensembles of trees compares
supervised and unsupervised tree based feature transformations.

Manifold learning techniques can also be useful to derive non-linear
representations of feature space, also these approaches focus also on
dimensionality reduction.
RandomForest, Extra-Trees and RandomTreesEmbedding estimators all support
warm_start=True which allows you to add more trees to an already fitted model.
When random_state is also set, the internal random state is also preserved
between fit calls. This means that training a model once with n estimators is
the same as building the model iteratively via multiple fit calls, where the
final number of estimators is equal to n.
Note that this differs from the usual behavior of random_state in that it does
not result in the same result across different calls.
In ensemble algorithms, bagging methods form a class of algorithms which build
several instances of a black-box estimator on random subsets of the original
training set and then aggregate their individual predictions to form a final
prediction. These methods are used as a way to reduce the variance of a base
estimator (e.g., a decision tree), by introducing randomization into its
construction procedure and then making an ensemble out of it. In many cases,
bagging methods constitute a very simple way to improve with respect to a
single model, without making it necessary to adapt the underlying base
algorithm. As they provide a way to reduce overfitting, bagging methods work
best with strong and complex models (e.g., fully developed decision trees), in
contrast with boosting methods which usually work best with weak models (e.g.,
shallow decision trees).
Bagging methods come in many flavours but mostly differ from each other by the
way they draw random subsets of the training set:
When random subsets of the dataset are drawn as random subsets of the
samples, then this algorithm is known as Pasting [B1999].
When samples are drawn with replacement, then the method is known as
Bagging [B1996].
When random subsets of the dataset are drawn as random subsets of
the features, then the method is known as Random Subspaces [H1998].
Finally, when base estimators are built on subsets of both samples and
features, then the method is known as Random Patches [LG2012].
In scikit-learn, bagging methods are offered as a unified
BaggingClassifier meta-estimator  (resp. BaggingRegressor),
taking as input a user-specified estimator along with parameters
specifying the strategy to draw random subsets. In particular, max_samples
and max_features control the size of the subsets (in terms of samples and
features), while bootstrap and bootstrap_features control whether
samples and features are drawn with or without replacement. When using a subset
of the available samples the generalization accuracy can be estimated with the
out-of-bag samples by setting oob_score=True. As an example, the
snippet below illustrates how to instantiate a bagging ensemble of
KNeighborsClassifier estimators, each built on random
subsets of 50% of the samples and 50% of the features.

The idea behind the VotingClassifier is to combine
conceptually different machine learning classifiers and use a majority vote
or the average predicted probabilities (soft vote) to predict the class labels.
Such a classifier can be useful for a set of equally well performing models
in order to balance out their individual weaknesses.
In majority voting, the predicted class label for a particular sample is
the class label that represents the majority (mode) of the class labels
predicted by each individual classifier.
E.g., if the prediction for a given sample is
classifier 1 -> class 1
classifier 2 -> class 1
classifier 3 -> class 2
the VotingClassifier (with voting='hard') would classify the sample
as “class 1” based on the majority class label.
In the cases of a tie, the VotingClassifier will select the class
based on the ascending sort order. E.g., in the following scenario
classifier 1 -> class 2
classifier 2 -> class 1
the class label 1 will be assigned to the sample.
The following example shows how to fit the majority rule classifier:
In contrast to majority voting (hard voting), soft voting
returns the class label as argmax of the sum of predicted probabilities.
Specific weights can be assigned to each classifier via the weights
parameter. When weights are provided, the predicted class probabilities
for each classifier are collected, multiplied by the classifier weight,
and averaged. The final class label is then derived from the class label
with the highest average probability.
To illustrate this with a simple example, let’s assume we have 3
classifiers and a 3-class classification problem where we assign
equal weights to all classifiers: w1=1, w2=1, w3=1.
The weighted average probabilities for a sample would then be
calculated as follows:
classifier
class 1
class 2
class 3
classifier 1
w1 * 0.2
w1 * 0.5
w1 * 0.3
classifier 2
w2 * 0.6
w2 * 0.3
w2 * 0.1
classifier 3
w3 * 0.3
w3 * 0.4
w3 * 0.3
weighted average
0.37
0.4
0.23
Here, the predicted class label is 2, since it has the highest average
predicted probability. See the example on
Visualizing the probabilistic predictions of a VotingClassifier for a
demonstration of how the predicted class label can be obtained from the weighted
average of predicted probabilities.
The following figure illustrates how the decision regions may change when
a soft VotingClassifier is trained with weights on three linear
models:
In order to predict the class labels based on the predicted
class-probabilities (scikit-learn estimators in the VotingClassifier
must support predict_proba method):
Optionally, weights can be provided for the individual classifiers:
The VotingClassifier can also be used together with
GridSearchCV in order to tune the
hyperparameters of the individual estimators:
The idea behind the VotingRegressor is to combine conceptually
different machine learning regressors and return the average predicted values.
Such a regressor can be useful for a set of equally well performing models
in order to balance out their individual weaknesses.
The following example shows how to fit the VotingRegressor:
Examples
Plot individual and voting regression predictions
Stacked generalization is a method for combining estimators to reduce their
biases [W1992] [HTF]. More precisely, the predictions of each individual
estimator are stacked together and used as input to a final estimator to
compute the prediction. This final estimator is trained through
cross-validation.
The StackingClassifier and StackingRegressor provide such
strategies which can be applied to classification and regression problems.
The estimators parameter corresponds to the list of the estimators which
are stacked together in parallel on the input data. It should be given as a
list of names and estimators:
The final_estimator will use the predictions of the estimators as input. It
needs to be a classifier or a regressor when using StackingClassifier
or StackingRegressor, respectively:
To train the estimators and final_estimator, the fit method needs
to be called on the training data:
During training, the estimators are fitted on the whole training data
X_train. They will be used when calling predict or predict_proba. To
generalize and avoid over-fitting, the final_estimator is trained on
out-samples using sklearn.model_selection.cross_val_predict internally.
For StackingClassifier, note that the output of the estimators is
controlled by the parameter stack_method and it is called by each estimator.
This parameter is either a string, being estimator method names, or 'auto'
which will automatically identify an available method depending on the
availability, tested in the order of preference: predict_proba,
decision_function and predict.
A StackingRegressor and StackingClassifier can be used as
any other regressor or classifier, exposing a predict, predict_proba, or
decision_function method, e.g.:
Note that it is also possible to get the output of the stacked
estimators using the transform method:
In practice, a stacking predictor predicts as good as the best predictor of the
base layer and even sometimes outperforms it by combining the different
strengths of these predictors. However, training a stacking predictor is
computationally expensive.
Note
For StackingClassifier, when using stack_method_='predict_proba',
the first column is dropped when the problem is a binary classification
problem. Indeed, both probability columns predicted by each estimator are
perfectly collinear.
Note
Multiple stacking layers can be achieved by assigning final_estimator to
a StackingClassifier or StackingRegressor:

Combine predictors using stacking

The module sklearn.ensemble includes the popular boosting algorithm
AdaBoost, introduced in 1995 by Freund and Schapire [FS1995].
The core principle of AdaBoost is to fit a sequence of weak learners (i.e.,
models that are only slightly better than random guessing, such as small
decision trees) on repeatedly modified versions of the data. The predictions
from all of them are then combined through a weighted majority vote (or sum) to
produce the final prediction. The data modifications at each so-called boosting
iteration consists of applying weights w1, w2, …, wN
to each of the training samples. Initially, those weights are all set to
wi=1/N, so that the first step simply trains a weak learner on the
original data. For each successive iteration, the sample weights are
individually modified and the learning algorithm is reapplied to the reweighted
data. At a given step, those training examples that were incorrectly predicted
by the boosted model induced at the previous step have their weights increased,
whereas the weights are decreased for those that were predicted correctly. As
iterations proceed, examples that are difficult to predict receive
ever-increasing influence. Each subsequent weak learner is thereby forced to
concentrate on the examples that are missed by the previous ones in the sequence
[HTF].
AdaBoost can be used both for classification and regression problems:
For multi-class classification, AdaBoostClassifier implements
AdaBoost.SAMME [ZZRH2009].
For regression, AdaBoostRegressor implements AdaBoost.R2 [D1997].
The following example shows how to fit an AdaBoost classifier with 100 weak
learners:
The number of weak learners is controlled by the parameter n_estimators. The
learning_rate parameter controls the contribution of the weak learners in
the final combination. By default, weak learners are decision stumps. Different
weak learners can be specified through the estimator parameter.
The main parameters to tune to obtain good results are n_estimators and
the complexity of the base estimators (e.g., its depth max_depth or
minimum required number of samples to consider a split min_samples_split).

of AdaBoost on a multi-class problem.

and decision function values for a non-linearly separable two-class problem

Title: Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
Author: Lewis Carroll
Release date: June 27, 2008 [eBook #11]
                Most recently updated: June 26, 2025
Language: English

Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and
of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister
was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, “and what is the
use of a book,” thought Alice “without pictures or conversations?”
So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day
made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a
daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies,
when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.
There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so
very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, “Oh dear! Oh
dear! I shall be late!” (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to
her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed
quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its
waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to
her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a
rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and
burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was
just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.
In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the
world she was to get out again.
The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped
suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping
herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.
Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of
time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen
next. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it
was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and
noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and there
she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the
shelves as she passed; it was labelled “ORANGE MARMALADE”, but to her great
disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear of
killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as
she fell past it.
“Well!” thought Alice to herself, “after such a fall as this, I shall think
nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they’ll all think me at home! Why, I
wouldn’t say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of the house!”
(Which was very likely true.)
Down, down, down. Would the fall never come to an end? “I wonder how
many miles I’ve fallen by this time?” she said aloud. “I must be getting
somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four thousand
miles down, I think—” (for, you see, Alice had learnt several things of this
sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a very
good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to listen
to her, still it was good practice to say it over) “—yes, that’s about the
right distance—but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I’ve got to?”
(Alice had no idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they
were nice grand words to say.)
Presently she began again. “I wonder if I shall fall right through the
earth! How funny it’ll seem to come out among the people that walk with their
heads downward! The Antipathies, I think—” (she was rather glad there
was no one listening, this time, as it didn’t sound at all the right
word) “—but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know.
Please, Ma’am, is this New Zealand or Australia?” (and she tried to curtsey as
she spoke—fancy curtseying as you’re falling through the air! Do you
think you could manage it?) “And what an ignorant little girl she’ll think me
for asking! No, it’ll never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up
somewhere.”
Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking
again. “Dinah’ll miss me very much to-night, I should think!” (Dinah was the
cat.) “I hope they’ll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time. Dinah my dear! I
wish you were down here with me! There are no mice in the air, I’m afraid, but
you might catch a bat, and that’s very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat
bats, I wonder?” And here Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying
to herself, in a dreamy sort of way, “Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?” and
sometimes, “Do bats eat cats?” for, you see, as she couldn’t answer either
question, it didn’t much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was
dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with
Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, “Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did
you ever eat a bat?” when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of
sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.
Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment: she
looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long passage,
and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. There was not a
moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear
it say, as it turned a corner, “Oh my ears and whiskers, how late it’s
getting!” She was close behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit
was no longer to be seen: she found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit
up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof.
There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice
had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she
walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again.
Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass;
there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice’s first thought was
that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas! either the
locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any rate it would not
open any of them. However, on the second time round, she came upon a low
curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about
fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her
great delight it fitted!
Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much
larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage into the
loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and
wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but
she could not even get her head through the doorway; “and even if my head would
go through,” thought poor Alice, “it would be of very little use without my
shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if
I only knew how to begin.” For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had
happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were
really impossible.
There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to
the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate a book
of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time she found a little
bottle on it, (“which certainly was not here before,” said Alice,) and round
the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words “DRINK ME,”
beautifully printed on it in large letters.
It was all very well to say “Drink me,” but the wise little Alice was not going
to do that in a hurry. “No, I’ll look first,” she said, “and see whether
it’s marked ‘poison’ or not”; for she had read several nice little
histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and
other unpleasant things, all because they would not remember the simple
rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot poker will burn
you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your finger very deeply
with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink
much from a bottle marked “poison,” it is almost certain to disagree with you,
sooner or later.
However, this bottle was not marked “poison,” so Alice ventured to taste
it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour of
cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot buttered
toast,) she very soon finished it off.

“What a curious feeling!” said Alice; “I must be shutting up like a telescope.”
And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face brightened
up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little
door into that lovely garden. First, however, she waited for a few minutes to
see if she was going to shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about
this; “for it might end, you know,” said Alice to herself, “in my going out
altogether, like a candle. I wonder what I should be like then?” And she tried
to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for
she could not remember ever having seen such a thing.
After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into
the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the door, she
found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the
table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it quite
plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs
of the table, but it was too slippery; and when she had tired herself out with
trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried.
“Come, there’s no use in crying like that!” said Alice to herself, rather
sharply; “I advise you to leave off this minute!” She generally gave herself
very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it), and sometimes she
scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she
remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of
croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious child was very fond
of pretending to be two people. “But it’s no use now,” thought poor Alice, “to
pretend to be two people! Why, there’s hardly enough of me left to make
one respectable person!”
Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table: she
opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words “EAT ME” were
beautifully marked in currants. “Well, I’ll eat it,” said Alice, “and if it
makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I
can creep under the door; so either way I’ll get into the garden, and I don’t
care which happens!”
She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, “Which way? Which way?”,
holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing, and
she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size: to be sure,
this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the
way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen, that it seemed
quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way.
So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.

“Curiouser and curiouser!” cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that for the
moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); “now I’m opening out like
the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!” (for when she looked down
at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of sight, they were getting so far
off). “Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on your shoes and
stockings for you now, dears? I’m sure I shan’t be able! I shall be a
great deal too far off to trouble myself about you: you must manage the best
way you can;—but I must be kind to them,” thought Alice, “or perhaps they won’t
walk the way I want to go! Let me see: I’ll give them a new pair of boots every
Christmas.”
And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. “They must go by
the carrier,” she thought; “and how funny it’ll seem, sending presents to one’s
own feet! And how odd the directions will look!
Oh dear, what nonsense I’m talking!”
Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was now
more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden key and
hurried off to the garden door.
Poor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to look
through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more hopeless than
ever: she sat down and began to cry again.
“You ought to be ashamed of yourself,” said Alice, “a great girl like you,”
(she might well say this), “to go on crying in this way! Stop this moment, I
tell you!” But she went on all the same, shedding gallons of tears, until there
was a large pool all round her, about four inches deep and reaching half down
the hall.
After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and she
hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White Rabbit
returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and
a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to
himself as he came, “Oh! the Duchess, the Duchess! Oh! won’t she be savage if
I’ve kept her waiting!” Alice felt so desperate that she was ready to ask help
of any one; so, when the Rabbit came near her, she began, in a low, timid
voice, “If you please, sir—” The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white
kid gloves and the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could
go.
Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she kept
fanning herself all the time she went on talking: “Dear, dear! How queer
everything is to-day! And yesterday things went on just as usual. I wonder if
I’ve been changed in the night? Let me think: was I the same when I got up this
morning? I almost think I can remember feeling a little different. But if I’m
not the same, the next question is, Who in the world am I? Ah, that’s
the great puzzle!” And she began thinking over all the children she knew that
were of the same age as herself, to see if she could have been changed for any
of them.
“I’m sure I’m not Ada,” she said, “for her hair goes in such long ringlets, and
mine doesn’t go in ringlets at all; and I’m sure I can’t be Mabel, for I know
all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows such a very little! Besides,
she’s she, and I’m I, and—oh dear, how puzzling it all is! I’ll
try if I know all the things I used to know. Let me see: four times five is
twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is—oh dear! I
shall never get to twenty at that rate! However, the Multiplication Table
doesn’t signify: let’s try Geography. London is the capital of Paris, and Paris
is the capital of Rome, and Rome—no, that’s all wrong, I’m certain! I
must have been changed for Mabel! I’ll try and say ‘How doth the
little—’” and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying
lessons, and began to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and
the words did not come the same as they used to do:—
“How doth the little crocodile
    Improve his shining tail,
And pour the waters of the Nile
    On every golden scale!

“How cheerfully he seems to grin,
    How neatly spread his claws,
And welcome little fishes in
    With gently smiling jaws!”
“I’m sure those are not the right words,” said poor Alice, and her eyes filled
with tears again as she went on, “I must be Mabel after all, and I shall have
to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to no toys to play
with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn! No, I’ve made up my mind about it;
if I’m Mabel, I’ll stay down here! It’ll be no use their putting their heads
down and saying ‘Come up again, dear!’ I shall only look up and say ‘Who am I
then? Tell me that first, and then, if I like being that person, I’ll come up:
if not, I’ll stay down here till I’m somebody else’—but, oh dear!” cried Alice,
with a sudden burst of tears, “I do wish they would put their heads
down! I am so very tired of being all alone here!”
As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see that
she had put on one of the Rabbit’s little white kid gloves while she was
talking. “How can I have done that?” she thought. “I must be growing
small again.” She got up and went to the table to measure herself by it, and
found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was now about two feet high, and
was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon found out that the cause of this was
the fan she was holding, and she dropped it hastily, just in time to avoid
shrinking away altogether.
“That was a narrow escape!” said Alice, a good deal frightened at the
sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence; “and now for
the garden!” and she ran with all speed back to the little door: but, alas! the
little door was shut again, and the little golden key was lying on the glass
table as before, “and things are worse than ever,” thought the poor child, “for
I never was so small as this before, never! And I declare it’s too bad, that it
is!”
As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment, splash! she
was up to her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that she had somehow
fallen into the sea, “and in that case I can go back by railway,” she said to
herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once in her life, and had come to the
general conclusion, that wherever you go to on the English coast you find a
number of bathing machines in the sea, some children digging in the sand with
wooden spades, then a row of lodging houses, and behind them a railway
station.) However, she soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which
she had wept when she was nine feet high.
“I wish I hadn’t cried so much!” said Alice, as she swam about, trying to find
her way out. “I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by being drowned in my
own tears! That will be a queer thing, to be sure! However, everything
is queer to-day.”
Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off, and
she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought it must be a
walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small she was now, and she
soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself.
“Would it be of any use, now,” thought Alice, “to speak to this mouse?
Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very likely it
can talk: at any rate, there’s no harm in trying.” So she began: “O Mouse, do
you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired of swimming about here, O
Mouse!” (Alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse: she
had never done such a thing before, but she remembered having seen in her
brother’s Latin Grammar, “A mouse—of a mouse—to a mouse—a mouse—O mouse!”) The
Mouse looked at her rather inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of
its little eyes, but it said nothing.
“Perhaps it doesn’t understand English,” thought Alice; “I daresay it’s a
French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.” (For, with all her
knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago anything had
happened.) So she began again: “Où est ma chatte?” which was the first sentence
in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water, and
seemed to quiver all over with fright. “Oh, I beg your pardon!” cried Alice
hastily, afraid that she had hurt the poor animal’s feelings. “I quite forgot
you didn’t like cats.”
“Not like cats!” cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. “Would
you like cats if you were me?”
“Well, perhaps not,” said Alice in a soothing tone: “don’t be angry about it.
And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you’d take a fancy to
cats if you could only see her. She is such a dear quiet thing,” Alice went on,
half to herself, as she swam lazily about in the pool, “and she sits purring so
nicely by the fire, licking her paws and washing her face—and she is such a
nice soft thing to nurse—and she’s such a capital one for catching mice—oh, I
beg your pardon!” cried Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all
over, and she felt certain it must be really offended. “We won’t talk about her
any more if you’d rather not.”
“We indeed!” cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his tail.
“As if I would talk on such a subject! Our family always hated
cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don’t let me hear the name again!”
“I won’t indeed!” said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of
conversation. “Are you—are you fond—of—of dogs?” The Mouse did not answer, so
Alice went on eagerly: “There is such a nice little dog near our house I should
like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you know, with oh, such long
curly brown hair! And it’ll fetch things when you throw them, and it’ll sit up
and beg for its dinner, and all sorts of things—I can’t remember half of
them—and it belongs to a farmer, you know, and he says it’s so useful, it’s
worth a hundred pounds! He says it kills all the rats and—oh dear!” cried Alice
in a sorrowful tone, “I’m afraid I’ve offended it again!” For the Mouse was
swimming away from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in
the pool as it went.
So she called softly after it, “Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we won’t
talk about cats or dogs either, if you don’t like them!” When the Mouse heard
this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its face was quite pale
(with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low trembling voice, “Let us
get to the shore, and then I’ll tell you my history, and you’ll understand why
it is I hate cats and dogs.”
It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds
and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and
an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice led the way, and the
whole party swam to the shore.
They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank—the birds
with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close to them, and
all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.
The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a consultation
about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural to Alice to find
herself talking familiarly with them, as if she had known them all her life.
Indeed, she had quite a long argument with the Lory, who at last turned sulky,
and would only say, “I am older than you, and must know better;” and this Alice
would not allow without knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively
refused to tell its age, there was no more to be said.
At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them, called
out, “Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! I’ll soon make you dry
enough!” They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the Mouse in the
middle. Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she felt sure she would
catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.
“Ahem!” said the Mouse with an important air, “are you all ready? This is the
driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please! ‘William the Conqueror,
whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted to by the English, who
wanted leaders, and had been of late much accustomed to usurpation and
conquest. Edwin and Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria—’”
“Ugh!” said the Lory, with a shiver.
“I beg your pardon!” said the Mouse, frowning, but very politely: “Did you
speak?”
“Not I!” said the Lory hastily.
“I thought you did,” said the Mouse. “—I proceed. ‘Edwin and Morcar, the earls
of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him: and even Stigand, the patriotic
archbishop of Canterbury, found it advisable—’”
“Found what?” said the Duck.
“Found it,” the Mouse replied rather crossly: “of course you know what
‘it’ means.”
“I know what ‘it’ means well enough, when I find a thing,” said the
Duck: “it’s generally a frog or a worm. The question is, what did the
archbishop find?”
The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, “‘—found it
advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him the crown.
William’s conduct at first was moderate. But the insolence of his Normans—’ How
are you getting on now, my dear?” it continued, turning to Alice as it spoke.
“As wet as ever,” said Alice in a melancholy tone: “it doesn’t seem to dry me
at all.”
“In that case,” said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, “I move that the
meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic remedies—”
“Speak English!” said the Eaglet. “I don’t know the meaning of half those long
words, and, what’s more, I don’t believe you do either!” And the Eaglet bent
down its head to hide a smile: some of the other birds tittered audibly.
“What I was going to say,” said the Dodo in an offended tone, “was, that the
best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.”
“What is a Caucus-race?” said Alice; not that she wanted much to know,
but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that somebody ought to speak,
and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.
“Why,” said the Dodo, “the best way to explain it is to do it.” (And, as you
might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will tell you how the
Dodo managed it.)
First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, (“the exact shape
doesn’t matter,” it said,) and then all the party were placed along the course,
here and there. There was no “One, two, three, and away,” but they began
running when they liked, and left off when they liked, so that it was not easy
to know when the race was over. However, when they had been running half an
hour or so, and were quite dry again, the Dodo suddenly called out “The race is
over!” and they all crowded round it, panting, and asking, “But who has won?”
This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought, and it
sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead (the position in
which you usually see Shakespeare, in the pictures of him), while the rest
waited in silence. At last the Dodo said, “Everybody has won, and all
must have prizes.”
“But who is to give the prizes?” quite a chorus of voices asked.
“Why, she, of course,” said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one finger;
and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a confused way,
“Prizes! Prizes!”
Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her pocket,
and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had not got into it),
and handed them round as prizes. There was exactly one a-piece, all round.
“But she must have a prize herself, you know,” said the Mouse.
“Of course,” the Dodo replied very gravely. “What else have you got in your
pocket?” he went on, turning to Alice.
“Only a thimble,” said Alice sadly.
“Hand it over here,” said the Dodo.
Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly presented
the thimble, saying “We beg your acceptance of this elegant thimble;” and, when
it had finished this short speech, they all cheered.
Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave that
she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of anything to say, she
simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as she could.
The next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and confusion, as
the large birds complained that they could not taste theirs, and the small ones
choked and had to be patted on the back. However, it was over at last, and they
sat down again in a ring, and begged the Mouse to tell them something more.
“You promised to tell me your history, you know,” said Alice, “and why it is
you hate—C and D,” she added in a whisper, half afraid that it would be
offended again.
“Mine is a long and a sad tale!” said the Mouse, turning to Alice, and sighing.
“It is a long tail, certainly,” said Alice, looking down with wonder at
the Mouse’s tail; “but why do you call it sad?” And she kept on puzzling about
it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the tale was something
like this:—
“You are not attending!” said the Mouse to Alice severely. “What are you
thinking of?”
“I beg your pardon,” said Alice very humbly: “you had got to the fifth bend, I
think?”
“I had not!” cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.
“A knot!” said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and looking
anxiously about her. “Oh, do let me help to undo it!”
“I shall do nothing of the sort,” said the Mouse, getting up and walking away.
“You insult me by talking such nonsense!”
“I didn’t mean it!” pleaded poor Alice. “But you’re so easily offended, you
know!”
The Mouse only growled in reply.
“Please come back and finish your story!” Alice called after it; and the others
all joined in chorus, “Yes, please do!” but the Mouse only shook its head
impatiently, and walked a little quicker.
“What a pity it wouldn’t stay!” sighed the Lory, as soon as it was quite out of
sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of saying to her daughter “Ah, my
dear! Let this be a lesson to you never to lose your temper!” “Hold your
tongue, Ma!” said the young Crab, a little snappishly. “You’re enough to try
the patience of an oyster!”
“I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!” said Alice aloud, addressing nobody
in particular. “She’d soon fetch it back!”
“And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?” said the Lory.
Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet: “Dinah’s
our cat. And she’s such a capital one for catching mice you can’t think! And
oh, I wish you could see her after the birds! Why, she’ll eat a little bird as
soon as look at it!”
This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party. Some of the birds
hurried off at once: one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very carefully,
remarking, “I really must be getting home; the night-air doesn’t suit my
throat!” and a Canary called out in a trembling voice to its children, “Come
away, my dears! It’s high time you were all in bed!” On various pretexts they
all moved off, and Alice was soon left alone.
“I wish I hadn’t mentioned Dinah!” she said to herself in a melancholy tone.
“Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I’m sure she’s the best cat in the
world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I wonder if I shall ever see you any more!” And here
poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very lonely and low-spirited. In a
little while, however, she again heard a little pattering of footsteps in the
distance, and she looked up eagerly, half hoping that the Mouse had changed his
mind, and was coming back to finish his story.
It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking anxiously
about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard it muttering to
itself “The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh my fur and whiskers!
She’ll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are ferrets! Where can I have
dropped them, I wonder?” Alice guessed in a moment that it was looking for the
fan and the pair of white kid gloves, and she very good-naturedly began hunting
about for them, but they were nowhere to be seen—everything seemed to have
changed since her swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table
and the little door, had vanished completely.
Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and called out
to her in an angry tone, “Why, Mary Ann, what are you doing out here?
Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan! Quick, now!” And
Alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once in the direction it
pointed to, without trying to explain the mistake it had made.
“He took me for his housemaid,” she said to herself as she ran. “How surprised
he’ll be when he finds out who I am! But I’d better take him his fan and
gloves—that is, if I can find them.” As she said this, she came upon a neat
little house, on the door of which was a bright brass plate with the name “W.
RABBIT,” engraved upon it. She went in without knocking, and hurried upstairs,
in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann, and be turned out of the
house before she had found the fan and gloves.
“How queer it seems,” Alice said to herself, “to be going messages for a
rabbit! I suppose Dinah’ll be sending me on messages next!” And she began
fancying the sort of thing that would happen: “‘Miss Alice! Come here directly,
and get ready for your walk!’ ‘Coming in a minute, nurse! But I’ve got to see
that the mouse doesn’t get out.’ Only I don’t think,” Alice went on, “that
they’d let Dinah stop in the house if it began ordering people about like
that!”
By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table in the
window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three pairs of tiny white
kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves, and was just going to
leave the room, when her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the
looking-glass. There was no label this time with the words “DRINK ME,” but
nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips. “I know something
interesting is sure to happen,” she said to herself, “whenever I eat or drink
anything; so I’ll just see what this bottle does. I do hope it’ll make me grow
large again, for really I’m quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!”
It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had drunk
half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling, and had to
stoop to save her neck from being broken. She hastily put down the bottle,
saying to herself “That’s quite enough—I hope I shan’t grow any more—As it is,
I can’t get out at the door—I do wish I hadn’t drunk quite so much!”
Alas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and growing, and very
soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there was not even room
for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with one elbow against the
door, and the other arm curled round her head. Still she went on growing, and,
as a last resource, she put one arm out of the window, and one foot up the
chimney, and said to herself “Now I can do no more, whatever happens. What
will become of me?”
Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect, and she
grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there seemed to be no
sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room again, no wonder she felt
unhappy.
“It was much pleasanter at home,” thought poor Alice, “when one wasn’t always
growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and rabbits. I
almost wish I hadn’t gone down that rabbit-hole—and yet—and yet—it’s rather
curious, you know, this sort of life! I do wonder what can have happened
to me! When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied that kind of thing never
happened, and now here I am in the middle of one! There ought to be a book
written about me, that there ought! And when I grow up, I’ll write one—but I’m
grown up now,” she added in a sorrowful tone; “at least there’s no room to grow
up any more here.”
“But then,” thought Alice, “shall I never get any older than I am now?
That’ll be a comfort, one way—never to be an old woman—but then—always to have
lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldn’t like that!”
“Oh, you foolish Alice!” she answered herself. “How can you learn lessons in
here? Why, there’s hardly room for you, and no room at all for any
lesson-books!”
And so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, and making quite
a conversation of it altogether; but after a few minutes she heard a voice
outside, and stopped to listen.
“Mary Ann! Mary Ann!” said the voice. “Fetch me my gloves this moment!” Then
came a little pattering of feet on the stairs. Alice knew it was the Rabbit
coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the house, quite
forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large as the Rabbit, and
had no reason to be afraid of it.
Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it; but, as the
door opened inwards, and Alice’s elbow was pressed hard against it, that
attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say to itself “Then I’ll go round and
get in at the window.”
“That you won’t!” thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied she
heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her hand, and
made a snatch in the air. She did not get hold of anything, but she heard a
little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass, from which she concluded
that it was just possible it had fallen into a cucumber-frame, or something of
the sort.
Next came an angry voice—the Rabbit’s—“Pat! Pat! Where are you?” And then a
voice she had never heard before, “Sure then I’m here! Digging for apples, yer
honour!”
“Digging for apples, indeed!” said the Rabbit angrily. “Here! Come and help me
out of this!” (Sounds of more broken glass.)
“Now tell me, Pat, what’s that in the window?”
“Sure, it’s an arm, yer honour!” (He pronounced it “arrum.”)
“An arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it fills the whole
window!”
“Sure, it does, yer honour: but it’s an arm for all that.”
“Well, it’s got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!”
There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers now and
then; such as, “Sure, I don’t like it, yer honour, at all, at all!” “Do as I
tell you, you coward!” and at last she spread out her hand again, and made
another snatch in the air. This time there were two little shrieks, and
more sounds of broken glass. “What a number of cucumber-frames there must be!”
thought Alice. “I wonder what they’ll do next! As for pulling me out of the
window, I only wish they could! I’m sure I don’t want to stay in
here any longer!”
She waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a rumbling
of little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices all talking together:
she made out the words: “Where’s the other ladder?—Why, I hadn’t to bring but
one; Bill’s got the other—Bill! fetch it here, lad!—Here, put ’em up at this
corner—No, tie ’em together first—they don’t reach half high enough yet—Oh!
they’ll do well enough; don’t be particular—Here, Bill! catch hold of this
rope—Will the roof bear?—Mind that loose slate—Oh, it’s coming down! Heads
below!” (a loud crash)—“Now, who did that?—It was Bill, I fancy—Who’s to go
down the chimney?—Nay, I shan’t! You do it!—That I won’t,
then!—Bill’s to go down—Here, Bill! the master says you’re to go down the
chimney!”
“Oh! So Bill’s got to come down the chimney, has he?” said Alice to herself.
“Shy, they seem to put everything upon Bill! I wouldn’t be in Bill’s place for
a good deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure; but I think I can
kick a little!”
She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited till she
heard a little animal (she couldn’t guess of what sort it was) scratching and
scrambling about in the chimney close above her: then, saying to herself “This
is Bill,” she gave one sharp kick, and waited to see what would happen next.
The first thing she heard was a general chorus of “There goes Bill!” then the
Rabbit’s voice along—“Catch him, you by the hedge!” then silence, and then
another confusion of voices—“Hold up his head—Brandy now—Don’t choke him—How
was it, old fellow? What happened to you? Tell us all about it!”
Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, (“That’s Bill,” thought Alice,)
“Well, I hardly know—No more, thank ye; I’m better now—but I’m a deal too
flustered to tell you—all I know is, something comes at me like a
Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes like a sky-rocket!”
“So you did, old fellow!” said the others.
“We must burn the house down!” said the Rabbit’s voice; and Alice called out as
loud as she could, “If you do, I’ll set Dinah at you!”
There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to herself, “I wonder
what they will do next! If they had any sense, they’d take the roof
off.” After a minute or two, they began moving about again, and Alice heard the
Rabbit say, “A barrowful will do, to begin with.”
“A barrowful of what?” thought Alice; but she had not long to doubt, for
the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the window, and
some of them hit her in the face. “I’ll put a stop to this,” she said to
herself, and shouted out, “You’d better not do that again!” which produced
another dead silence.
Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into little
cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her head. “If I eat
one of these cakes,” she thought, “it’s sure to make some change in my
size; and as it can’t possibly make me larger, it must make me smaller, I
suppose.”
So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she began
shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get through the door,
she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of little animals and birds
waiting outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill, was in the middle, being held up
by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it something out of a bottle. They all made
a rush at Alice the moment she appeared; but she ran off as hard as she could,
and soon found herself safe in a thick wood.
“The first thing I’ve got to do,” said Alice to herself, as she wandered about
in the wood, “is to grow to my right size again; and the second thing is to
find my way into that lovely garden. I think that will be the best plan.”
It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply arranged;
the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea how to set about
it; and while she was peering about anxiously among the trees, a little sharp
bark just over her head made her look up in a great hurry.
An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and feebly
stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. “Poor little thing!” said Alice,
in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to it; but she was terribly
frightened all the time at the thought that it might be hungry, in which case
it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing.
Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and held it
out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off all its feet at
once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick, and made believe to
worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle, to keep herself from being
run over; and the moment she appeared on the other side, the puppy made another
rush at the stick, and tumbled head over heels in its hurry to get hold of it;
then Alice, thinking it was very like having a game of play with a cart-horse,
and expecting every moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle
again; then the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a
very little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely
all the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with its
tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.
This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she set off
at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath, and till the
puppy’s bark sounded quite faint in the distance.
“And yet what a dear little puppy it was!” said Alice, as she leant against a
buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the leaves: “I should
have liked teaching it tricks very much, if—if I’d only been the right size to
do it! Oh dear! I’d nearly forgotten that I’ve got to grow up again! Let me
see—how is it to be managed? I suppose I ought to eat or drink something
or other; but the great question is, what?”
The great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round her at the
flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that looked like
the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances. There was a large
mushroom growing near her, about the same height as herself; and when she had
looked under it, and on both sides of it, and behind it, it occurred to her
that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it.
She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the mushroom,
and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue caterpillar, that was
sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly smoking a long hookah, and
taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else.
The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence: at
last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and addressed her in a
languid, sleepy voice.
“Who are you?” said the Caterpillar.
This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied, rather
shyly, “I—I hardly know, sir, just at present—at least I know who I was
when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been changed several times
since then.”
“What do you mean by that?” said the Caterpillar sternly. “Explain yourself!”
“I can’t explain myself, I’m afraid, sir,” said Alice, “because I’m not
myself, you see.”
“I don’t see,” said the Caterpillar.
“I’m afraid I can’t put it more clearly,” Alice replied very politely, “for I
can’t understand it myself to begin with; and being so many different sizes in
a day is very confusing.”
“It isn’t,” said the Caterpillar.
“Well, perhaps you haven’t found it so yet,” said Alice; “but when you have to
turn into a chrysalis—you will some day, you know—and then after that into a
butterfly, I should think you’ll feel it a little queer, won’t you?”
“Not a bit,” said the Caterpillar.
“Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,” said Alice; “all I know is, it
would feel very queer to me.”
“You!” said the Caterpillar contemptuously. “Who are you?”
Which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation. Alice felt
a little irritated at the Caterpillar’s making such very short remarks,
and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, “I think, you ought to tell me
who you are, first.”
“Why?” said the Caterpillar.
Here was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not think of any good
reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a very unpleasant state
of mind, she turned away.
“Come back!” the Caterpillar called after her. “I’ve something important to
say!”
This sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back again.
“Keep your temper,” said the Caterpillar.
“Is that all?” said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she could.
“No,” said the Caterpillar.
Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do, and
perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing. For some minutes
it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded its arms, took the
hookah out of its mouth again, and said, “So you think you’re changed, do you?”
“I’m afraid I am, sir,” said Alice; “I can’t remember things as I used—and I
don’t keep the same size for ten minutes together!”
“Can’t remember what things?” said the Caterpillar.
“Well, I’ve tried to say “How doth the little busy bee,” but it all came
different!” Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.
“Repeat, ‘You are old, Father William,’” said the Caterpillar.
Alice folded her hands, and began:—
“You are old, Father William,” the young man said,
    “And your hair has become very white;
And yet you incessantly stand on your head—
    Do you think, at your age, it is right?”

“In my youth,” Father William replied to his son,
    “I feared it might injure the brain;
But, now that I’m perfectly sure I have none,
    Why, I do it again and again.”

“You are old,” said the youth, “as I mentioned before,
    And have grown most uncommonly fat;
Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door—
    Pray, what is the reason of that?”

“In my youth,” said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,
    “I kept all my limbs very supple
By the use of this ointment—one shilling the box—
    Allow me to sell you a couple?”

“You are old,” said the youth, “and your jaws are too weak
    For anything tougher than suet;
Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak—
    Pray, how did you manage to do it?”

“In my youth,” said his father, “I took to the law,
    And argued each case with my wife;
And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,
    Has lasted the rest of my life.”

“You are old,” said the youth, “one would hardly suppose
    That your eye was as steady as ever;
Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose—
    What made you so awfully clever?”

“I have answered three questions, and that is enough,”
    Said his father; “don’t give yourself airs!
Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?
    Be off, or I’ll kick you down stairs!”
“That is not said right,” said the Caterpillar.
“Not quite right, I’m afraid,” said Alice, timidly; “some of the words
have got altered.”
“It is wrong from beginning to end,” said the Caterpillar decidedly, and there
was silence for some minutes.
The Caterpillar was the first to speak.
“What size do you want to be?” it asked.
“Oh, I’m not particular as to size,” Alice hastily replied; “only one doesn’t
like changing so often, you know.”
“I don’t know,” said the Caterpillar.
Alice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in her life before,
and she felt that she was losing her temper.
“Are you content now?” said the Caterpillar.
“Well, I should like to be a little larger, sir, if you wouldn’t mind,”
said Alice: “three inches is such a wretched height to be.”
“It is a very good height indeed!” said the Caterpillar angrily, rearing itself
upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high).
“But I’m not used to it!” pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone. And she thought
of herself, “I wish the creatures wouldn’t be so easily offended!”
“You’ll get used to it in time,” said the Caterpillar; and it put the hookah
into its mouth and began smoking again.
This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again. In a minute or
two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and yawned once or twice,
and shook itself. Then it got down off the mushroom, and crawled away in the
grass, merely remarking as it went, “One side will make you grow taller, and
the other side will make you grow shorter.”
“One side of what? The other side of what?” thought Alice to
herself.
“Of the mushroom,” said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it aloud; and
in another moment it was out of sight.
Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute, trying to
make out which were the two sides of it; and as it was perfectly round, she
found this a very difficult question. However, at last she stretched her arms
round it as far as they would go, and broke off a bit of the edge with each
hand.
“And now which is which?” she said to herself, and nibbled a little of the
right-hand bit to try the effect: the next moment she felt a violent blow
underneath her chin: it had struck her foot!
She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt that
there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she set to work
at once to eat some of the other bit. Her chin was pressed so closely against
her foot, that there was hardly room to open her mouth; but she did it at last,
and managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit.

“Come, my head’s free at last!” said Alice in a tone of delight, which changed
into alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders were nowhere to
be found: all she could see, when she looked down, was an immense length of
neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay
far below her.
“What can all that green stuff be?” said Alice. “And where have
my shoulders got to? And oh, my poor hands, how is it I can’t see you?” She was
moving them about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow, except a little
shaking among the distant green leaves.
As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head, she tried
to get her head down to them, and was delighted to find that her neck would
bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent. She had just succeeded in
curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was going to dive in among the
leaves, which she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she
had been wandering, when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurry: a large
pigeon had flown into her face, and was beating her violently with its wings.
“Serpent!” screamed the Pigeon.
“I’m not a serpent!” said Alice indignantly. “Let me alone!”
“Serpent, I say again!” repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued tone, and
added with a kind of sob, “I’ve tried every way, and nothing seems to suit
them!”
“I haven’t the least idea what you’re talking about,” said Alice.
“I’ve tried the roots of trees, and I’ve tried banks, and I’ve tried hedges,”
the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; “but those serpents! There’s no
pleasing them!”
Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in saying
anything more till the Pigeon had finished.
“As if it wasn’t trouble enough hatching the eggs,” said the Pigeon; “but I
must be on the look-out for serpents night and day! Why, I haven’t had a wink
of sleep these three weeks!”
“I’m very sorry you’ve been annoyed,” said Alice, who was beginning to see its
meaning.
“And just as I’d taken the highest tree in the wood,” continued the Pigeon,
raising its voice to a shriek, “and just as I was thinking I should be free of
them at last, they must needs come wriggling down from the sky! Ugh, Serpent!”
“But I’m not a serpent, I tell you!” said Alice. “I’m a—I’m a—”
“Well! What are you?” said the Pigeon. “I can see you’re trying to
invent something!”
“I—I’m a little girl,” said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered the
number of changes she had gone through that day.
“A likely story indeed!” said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest contempt.
“I’ve seen a good many little girls in my time, but never one with such
a neck as that! No, no! You’re a serpent; and there’s no use denying it. I
suppose you’ll be telling me next that you never tasted an egg!”
“I have tasted eggs, certainly,” said Alice, who was a very truthful
child; “but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you know.”
“I don’t believe it,” said the Pigeon; “but if they do, why then they’re a kind
of serpent, that’s all I can say.”
This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a minute or
two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, “You’re looking for eggs,
I know that well enough; and what does it matter to me whether you’re a
little girl or a serpent?”
“It matters a good deal to me,” said Alice hastily; “but I’m not looking
for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn’t want yours: I don’t
like them raw.”
“Well, be off, then!” said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled down again
into its nest. Alice crouched down among the trees as well as she could, for
her neck kept getting entangled among the branches, and every now and then she
had to stop and untwist it. After a while she remembered that she still held
the pieces of mushroom in her hands, and she set to work very carefully,
nibbling first at one and then at the other, and growing sometimes taller and
sometimes shorter, until she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her
usual height.
It was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it felt
quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes, and began
talking to herself, as usual. “Come, there’s half my plan done now! How
puzzling all these changes are! I’m never sure what I’m going to be, from one
minute to another! However, I’ve got back to my right size: the next thing is,
to get into that beautiful garden—how is that to be done, I wonder?” As
she said this, she came suddenly upon an open place, with a little house in it
about four feet high. “Whoever lives there,” thought Alice, “it’ll never do to
come upon them this size: why, I should frighten them out of their
wits!” So she began nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did not venture to
go near the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high.
For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what to do
next, when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the wood—(she
considered him to be a footman because he was in livery: otherwise, judging by
his face only, she would have called him a fish)—and rapped loudly at the door
with his knuckles. It was opened by another footman in livery, with a round
face, and large eyes like a frog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered
hair that curled all over their heads. She felt very curious to know what it
was all about, and crept a little way out of the wood to listen.
The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter, nearly
as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other, saying, in a solemn
tone, “For the Duchess. An invitation from the Queen to play croquet.” The
Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn tone, only changing the order of the
words a little, “From the Queen. An invitation for the Duchess to play
croquet.”
Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together.
Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the wood for fear
of their hearing her; and when she next peeped out the Fish-Footman was gone,
and the other was sitting on the ground near the door, staring stupidly up into
the sky.
Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.
“There’s no sort of use in knocking,” said the Footman, “and that for two
reasons. First, because I’m on the same side of the door as you are; secondly,
because they’re making such a noise inside, no one could possibly hear you.”
And certainly there was a most extraordinary noise going on within—a
constant howling and sneezing, and every now and then a great crash, as if a
dish or kettle had been broken to pieces.
“Please, then,” said Alice, “how am I to get in?”
“There might be some sense in your knocking,” the Footman went on without
attending to her, “if we had the door between us. For instance, if you were
inside, you might knock, and I could let you out, you know.” He was
looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, and this Alice thought
decidedly uncivil. “But perhaps he can’t help it,” she said to herself; “his
eyes are so very nearly at the top of his head. But at any rate he might
answer questions.—How am I to get in?” she repeated, aloud.
“I shall sit here,” the Footman remarked, “till tomorrow—”
At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate came skimming
out, straight at the Footman’s head: it just grazed his nose, and broke to
pieces against one of the trees behind him.
“—or next day, maybe,” the Footman continued in the same tone, exactly as if
nothing had happened.
“How am I to get in?” asked Alice again, in a louder tone.
“Are you to get in at all?” said the Footman. “That’s the first
question, you know.”
It was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so. “It’s really
dreadful,” she muttered to herself, “the way all the creatures argue. It’s
enough to drive one crazy!”
The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his remark,
with variations. “I shall sit here,” he said, “on and off, for days and days.”
“But what am I to do?” said Alice.
“Anything you like,” said the Footman, and began whistling.
“Oh, there’s no use in talking to him,” said Alice desperately: “he’s perfectly
idiotic!” And she opened the door and went in.
The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from one end
to the other: the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool in the middle,
nursing a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire, stirring a large cauldron
which seemed to be full of soup.
“There’s certainly too much pepper in that soup!” Alice said to herself, as
well as she could for sneezing.
There was certainly too much of it in the air. Even the Duchess sneezed
occasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling alternately
without a moment’s pause. The only things in the kitchen that did not sneeze,
were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grinning
from ear to ear.
“Please would you tell me,” said Alice, a little timidly, for she was not quite
sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first, “why your cat grins
like that?”
“It’s a Cheshire cat,” said the Duchess, “and that’s why. Pig!”
She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite jumped; but
she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the baby, and not to her, so
she took courage, and went on again:—
“I didn’t know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didn’t know that
cats could grin.”
“They all can,” said the Duchess; “and most of ’em do.”
“I don’t know of any that do,” Alice said very politely, feeling quite pleased
to have got into a conversation.
“You don’t know much,” said the Duchess; “and that’s a fact.”
Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would be as
well to introduce some other subject of conversation. While she was trying to
fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the fire, and at once set to
work throwing everything within her reach at the Duchess and the baby—the
fire-irons came first; then followed a shower of saucepans, plates, and dishes.
The Duchess took no notice of them even when they hit her; and the baby was
howling so much already, that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows
hurt it or not.
“Oh, please mind what you’re doing!” cried Alice, jumping up and down in
an agony of terror. “Oh, there goes his precious nose!” as an unusually
large saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it off.
“If everybody minded their own business,” the Duchess said in a hoarse growl,
“the world would go round a deal faster than it does.”
“Which would not be an advantage,” said Alice, who felt very glad to get
an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge. “Just think of what
work it would make with the day and night! You see the earth takes twenty-four
hours to turn round on its axis—”
“Talking of axes,” said the Duchess, “chop off her head!”
Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to take the
hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to be
listening, so she went on again: “Twenty-four hours, I think; or is it
twelve? I—”
“Oh, don’t bother me,” said the Duchess; “I never could abide figures!”
And with that she began nursing her child again, singing a sort of lullaby to
it as she did so, and giving it a violent shake at the end of every line:
“Speak roughly to your little boy,
    And beat him when he sneezes:
He only does it to annoy,
    Because he knows it teases.”
CHORUS.
(In which the cook and the baby joined):
“Wow! wow! wow!”
While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept tossing the baby
violently up and down, and the poor little thing howled so, that Alice could
hardly hear the words:—
“I speak severely to my boy,
    I beat him when he sneezes;
For he can thoroughly enjoy
    The pepper when he pleases!”
CHORUS.
“Wow! wow! wow!”
“Here! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!” the Duchess said to Alice,
flinging the baby at her as she spoke. “I must go and get ready to play croquet
with the Queen,” and she hurried out of the room. The cook threw a frying-pan
after her as she went out, but it just missed her.
Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped little
creature, and held out its arms and legs in all directions, “just like a
star-fish,” thought Alice. The poor little thing was snorting like a
steam-engine when she caught it, and kept doubling itself up and straightening
itself out again, so that altogether, for the first minute or two, it was as
much as she could do to hold it.
As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it, (which was to twist
it up into a sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its right ear and left
foot, so as to prevent its undoing itself,) she carried it out into the open
air. “If I don’t take this child away with me,” thought Alice, “they’re sure to
kill it in a day or two: wouldn’t it be murder to leave it behind?” She said
the last words out loud, and the little thing grunted in reply (it had left off
sneezing by this time). “Don’t grunt,” said Alice; “that’s not at all a proper
way of expressing yourself.”
The baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into its face to see
what was the matter with it. There could be no doubt that it had a very
turn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose; also its eyes were
getting extremely small for a baby: altogether Alice did not like the look of
the thing at all. “But perhaps it was only sobbing,” she thought, and looked
into its eyes again, to see if there were any tears.
No, there were no tears. “If you’re going to turn into a pig, my dear,” said
Alice, seriously, “I’ll have nothing more to do with you. Mind now!” The poor
little thing sobbed again (or grunted, it was impossible to say which), and
they went on for some while in silence.
Alice was just beginning to think to herself, “Now, what am I to do with this
creature when I get it home?” when it grunted again, so violently, that she
looked down into its face in some alarm. This time there could be no
mistake about it: it was neither more nor less than a pig, and she felt that it
would be quite absurd for her to carry it further.
So she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see it trot
away quietly into the wood. “If it had grown up,” she said to herself, “it
would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes rather a handsome pig, I
think.” And she began thinking over other children she knew, who might do very
well as pigs, and was just saying to herself, “if one only knew the right way
to change them—” when she was a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat
sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off.
The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked good-natured, she thought:
still it had very long claws and a great many teeth, so she felt that it
ought to be treated with respect.
“Cheshire Puss,” she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know whether
it would like the name: however, it only grinned a little wider. “Come, it’s
pleased so far,” thought Alice, and she went on. “Would you tell me, please,
which way I ought to go from here?”
“That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,” said the Cat.
“I don’t much care where—” said Alice.
“Then it doesn’t matter which way you go,” said the Cat.
“—so long as I get somewhere,” Alice added as an explanation.
“Oh, you’re sure to do that,” said the Cat, “if you only walk long enough.”
Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another question. “What
sort of people live about here?”
“In that direction,” the Cat said, waving its right paw round, “lives a
Hatter: and in that direction,” waving the other paw, “lives a March
Hare. Visit either you like: they’re both mad.”
“But I don’t want to go among mad people,” Alice remarked.
“Oh, you can’t help that,” said the Cat: “we’re all mad here. I’m mad. You’re
mad.”
“How do you know I’m mad?” said Alice.
“You must be,” said the Cat, “or you wouldn’t have come here.”
Alice didn’t think that proved it at all; however, she went on “And how do you
know that you’re mad?”
“To begin with,” said the Cat, “a dog’s not mad. You grant that?”
“I suppose so,” said Alice.
“Well, then,” the Cat went on, “you see, a dog growls when it’s angry, and wags
its tail when it’s pleased. Now I growl when I’m pleased, and wag my
tail when I’m angry. Therefore I’m mad.”
“I call it purring, not growling,” said Alice.
“Call it what you like,” said the Cat. “Do you play croquet with the Queen
to-day?”
“I should like it very much,” said Alice, “but I haven’t been invited yet.”
“You’ll see me there,” said the Cat, and vanished.
Alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to queer things
happening. While she was looking at the place where it had been, it suddenly
appeared again.
“By-the-bye, what became of the baby?” said the Cat. “I’d nearly forgotten to
ask.”
“It turned into a pig,” Alice quietly said, just as if it had come back in a
natural way.
“I thought it would,” said the Cat, and vanished again.
Alice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not appear,
and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in which the March
Hare was said to live. “I’ve seen hatters before,” she said to herself; “the
March Hare will be much the most interesting, and perhaps as this is May it
won’t be raving mad—at least not so mad as it was in March.” As she said this,
she looked up, and there was the Cat again, sitting on a branch of a tree.
“Did you say pig, or fig?” said the Cat.
“I said pig,” replied Alice; “and I wish you wouldn’t keep appearing and
vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.”
“All right,” said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly, beginning
with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which remained some time
after the rest of it had gone.
“Well! I’ve often seen a cat without a grin,” thought Alice; “but a grin
without a cat! It’s the most curious thing I ever saw in my life!”
She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of the
March Hare: she thought it must be the right house, because the chimneys were
shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur. It was so large a house,
that she did not like to go nearer till she had nibbled some more of the
lefthand bit of mushroom, and raised herself to about two feet high: even then
she walked up towards it rather timidly, saying to herself “Suppose it should
be raving mad after all! I almost wish I’d gone to see the Hatter instead!”
There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the March
Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting between them,
fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a cushion, resting their elbows
on it, and talking over its head. “Very uncomfortable for the Dormouse,”
thought Alice; “only, as it’s asleep, I suppose it doesn’t mind.”
The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at one
corner of it: “No room! No room!” they cried out when they saw Alice coming.
“There’s plenty of room!” said Alice indignantly, and she sat down in a
large arm-chair at one end of the table.
“Have some wine,” the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.
Alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea. “I don’t
see any wine,” she remarked.
“There isn’t any,” said the March Hare.
“Then it wasn’t very civil of you to offer it,” said Alice angrily.
“It wasn’t very civil of you to sit down without being invited,” said the March
Hare.
“I didn’t know it was your table,” said Alice; “it’s laid for a great
many more than three.”
“Your hair wants cutting,” said the Hatter. He had been looking at Alice for
some time with great curiosity, and this was his first speech.
“You should learn not to make personal remarks,” Alice said with some severity;
“it’s very rude.”
The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he said
was, “Why is a raven like a writing-desk?”
“Come, we shall have some fun now!” thought Alice. “I’m glad they’ve begun
asking riddles.—I believe I can guess that,” she added aloud.
“Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?” said the March
Hare.
“Exactly so,” said Alice.
“Then you should say what you mean,” the March Hare went on.
“I do,” Alice hastily replied; “at least—at least I mean what I say—that’s the
same thing, you know.”
“Not the same thing a bit!” said the Hatter. “You might just as well say that
‘I see what I eat’ is the same thing as ‘I eat what I see’!”
“You might just as well say,” added the March Hare, “that ‘I like what I get’
is the same thing as ‘I get what I like’!”
“You might just as well say,” added the Dormouse, who seemed to be talking in
his sleep, “that ‘I breathe when I sleep’ is the same thing as ‘I sleep when I
breathe’!”
“It is the same thing with you,” said the Hatter, and here the
conversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, while Alice
thought over all she could remember about ravens and writing-desks, which
wasn’t much.
The Hatter was the first to break the silence. “What day of the month is it?”
he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his watch out of his pocket, and was
looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now and then, and holding it to his
ear.
Alice considered a little, and then said “The fourth.”
“Two days wrong!” sighed the Hatter. “I told you butter wouldn’t suit the
works!” he added looking angrily at the March Hare.
“It was the best butter,” the March Hare meekly replied.
“Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,” the Hatter grumbled: “you
shouldn’t have put it in with the bread-knife.”
The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then he dipped it into
his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he could think of nothing better to
say than his first remark, “It was the best butter, you know.”
Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity. “What a funny
watch!” she remarked. “It tells the day of the month, and doesn’t tell what
o’clock it is!”
“Why should it?” muttered the Hatter. “Does your watch tell you what
year it is?”
“Of course not,” Alice replied very readily: “but that’s because it stays the
same year for such a long time together.”
“Which is just the case with mine,” said the Hatter.
Alice felt dreadfully puzzled, The Hatter’s remark seemed to have no sort of
meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English. “I don’t quite understand
you,” she said, as politely as she could.
“The Dormouse is asleep again,” said the Hatter, and he poured a little hot tea
upon its nose.
The Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without opening its eyes,
“Of course, of course; just what I was going to remark myself.”
“Have you guessed the riddle yet?” the Hatter said, turning to Alice again.
“No, I give it up,” Alice replied: “what’s the answer?”
“I haven’t the slightest idea,” said the Hatter.
“Nor I,” said the March Hare.
Alice sighed wearily. “I think you might do something better with the time,”
she said, “than waste it in asking riddles that have no answers.”
“If you knew Time as well as I do,” said the Hatter, “you wouldn’t talk about
wasting it. It’s him.”
“I don’t know what you mean,” said Alice.
“Of course you don’t!” the Hatter said, tossing his head contemptuously. “I
dare say you never even spoke to Time!”
“Perhaps not,” Alice cautiously replied: “but I know I have to beat time when I
learn music.”
“Ah! that accounts for it,” said the Hatter. “He won’t stand beating. Now, if
you only kept on good terms with him, he’d do almost anything you liked with
the clock. For instance, suppose it were nine o’clock in the morning, just time
to begin lessons: you’d only have to whisper a hint to Time, and round goes the
clock in a twinkling! Half-past one, time for dinner!”
(“I only wish it was,” the March Hare said to itself in a whisper.)
“That would be grand, certainly,” said Alice thoughtfully: “but then—I
shouldn’t be hungry for it, you know.”
“Not at first, perhaps,” said the Hatter: “but you could keep it to half-past
one as long as you liked.”
“Is that the way you manage?” Alice asked.
The Hatter shook his head mournfully. “Not I!” he replied. “We quarrelled last
March—just before he went mad, you know—” (pointing with his tea spoon
at the March Hare,) “—it was at the great concert given by the Queen of Hearts,
and I had to sing
‘Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!
How I wonder what you’re at!’
You know the song, perhaps?”
“I’ve heard something like it,” said Alice.
“It goes on, you know,” the Hatter continued, “in this way:—
‘Up above the world you fly,
Like a tea-tray in the sky.
                    Twinkle, twinkle—’”
Here the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep “Twinkle,
twinkle, twinkle, twinkle—” and went on so long that they had to pinch it
to make it stop.
“Well, I’d hardly finished the first verse,” said the Hatter, “when the Queen
jumped up and bawled out, ‘He’s murdering the time! Off with his head!’”
“How dreadfully savage!” exclaimed Alice.
“And ever since that,” the Hatter went on in a mournful tone, “he won’t do a
thing I ask! It’s always six o’clock now.”
A bright idea came into Alice’s head. “Is that the reason so many tea-things
are put out here?” she asked.
“Yes, that’s it,” said the Hatter with a sigh: “it’s always tea-time, and we’ve
no time to wash the things between whiles.”
“Then you keep moving round, I suppose?” said Alice.
“Exactly so,” said the Hatter: “as the things get used up.”
“But what happens when you come to the beginning again?” Alice ventured to ask.
“Suppose we change the subject,” the March Hare interrupted, yawning. “I’m
getting tired of this. I vote the young lady tells us a story.”
“I’m afraid I don’t know one,” said Alice, rather alarmed at the proposal.
“Then the Dormouse shall!” they both cried. “Wake up, Dormouse!” And they
pinched it on both sides at once.
The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes. “I wasn’t asleep,” he said in a hoarse,
feeble voice: “I heard every word you fellows were saying.”
“Tell us a story!” said the March Hare.
“Yes, please do!” pleaded Alice.
“And be quick about it,” added the Hatter, “or you’ll be asleep again before
it’s done.”
“Once upon a time there were three little sisters,” the Dormouse began in a
great hurry; “and their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie; and they lived at
the bottom of a well—”
“What did they live on?” said Alice, who always took a great interest in
questions of eating and drinking.
“They lived on treacle,” said the Dormouse, after thinking a minute or two.
“They couldn’t have done that, you know,” Alice gently remarked; “they’d have
been ill.”
“So they were,” said the Dormouse; “very ill.”
Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary way of living would
be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went on: “But why did they live at
the bottom of a well?”
“Take some more tea,” the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly.
“I’ve had nothing yet,” Alice replied in an offended tone, “so I can’t take
more.”
“You mean you can’t take less,” said the Hatter: “it’s very easy to take
more than nothing.”
“Nobody asked your opinion,” said Alice.
“Who’s making personal remarks now?” the Hatter asked triumphantly.
Alice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped herself to some tea
and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the Dormouse, and repeated her
question. “Why did they live at the bottom of a well?”
The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and then said, “It
was a treacle-well.”
“There’s no such thing!” Alice was beginning very angrily, but the Hatter and
the March Hare went “Sh! sh!” and the Dormouse sulkily remarked, “If you can’t
be civil, you’d better finish the story for yourself.”
“No, please go on!” Alice said very humbly; “I won’t interrupt again. I dare
say there may be one.”
“One, indeed!” said the Dormouse indignantly. However, he consented to go on.
“And so these three little sisters—they were learning to draw, you know—”
“What did they draw?” said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.
“Treacle,” said the Dormouse, without considering at all this time.
“I want a clean cup,” interrupted the Hatter: “let’s all move one place on.”
He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the March Hare moved
into the Dormouse’s place, and Alice rather unwillingly took the place of the
March Hare. The Hatter was the only one who got any advantage from the change:
and Alice was a good deal worse off than before, as the March Hare had just
upset the milk-jug into his plate.
Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began very cautiously:
“But I don’t understand. Where did they draw the treacle from?”
“You can draw water out of a water-well,” said the Hatter; “so I should think
you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well—eh, stupid?”
“But they were in the well,” Alice said to the Dormouse, not choosing to
notice this last remark.
“Of course they were,” said the Dormouse; “—well in.”
This answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse go on for some
time without interrupting it.
“They were learning to draw,” the Dormouse went on, yawning and rubbing its
eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; “and they drew all manner of
things—everything that begins with an M—”
“Why with an M?” said Alice.
“Why not?” said the March Hare.
Alice was silent.
The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going off into a doze;
but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up again with a little shriek, and
went on: “—that begins with an M, such as mouse-traps, and the moon, and
memory, and muchness—you know you say things are “much of a muchness”—did you
ever see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness?”
“Really, now you ask me,” said Alice, very much confused, “I don’t think—”
“Then you shouldn’t talk,” said the Hatter.
This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear: she got up in great
disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep instantly, and neither of the
others took the least notice of her going, though she looked back once or
twice, half hoping that they would call after her: the last time she saw them,
they were trying to put the Dormouse into the teapot.
“At any rate I’ll never go there again!” said Alice as she picked her
way through the wood. “It’s the stupidest tea-party I ever was at in all my
life!”
Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a door leading
right into it. “That’s very curious!” she thought. “But everything’s curious
today. I think I may as well go in at once.” And in she went.
Once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the little glass
table. “Now, I’ll manage better this time,” she said to herself, and began by
taking the little golden key, and unlocking the door that led into the garden.
Then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom (she had kept a piece of it in
her pocket) till she was about a foot high: then she walked down the little
passage: and then—she found herself at last in the beautiful garden,
among the bright flower-beds and the cool fountains.
A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the roses growing on
it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily painting them red.
Alice thought this a very curious thing, and she went nearer to watch them, and
just as she came up to them she heard one of them say, “Look out now, Five!
Don’t go splashing paint over me like that!”
“I couldn’t help it,” said Five, in a sulky tone; “Seven jogged my elbow.”
On which Seven looked up and said, “That’s right, Five! Always lay the blame on
others!”
“You’d better not talk!” said Five. “I heard the Queen say only
yesterday you deserved to be beheaded!”
“What for?” said the one who had spoken first.
“That’s none of your business, Two!” said Seven.
“Yes, it is his business!” said Five, “and I’ll tell him—it was for
bringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.”
Seven flung down his brush, and had just begun “Well, of all the unjust
things—” when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as she stood watching them,
and he checked himself suddenly: the others looked round also, and all of them
bowed low.
“Would you tell me,” said Alice, a little timidly, “why you are painting those
roses?”
Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. Two began in a low voice, “Why
the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have been a red
rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake; and if the Queen was to find
it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know. So you see, Miss, we’re
doing our best, afore she comes, to—” At this moment Five, who had been
anxiously looking across the garden, called out “The Queen! The Queen!” and the
three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon their faces. There was a
sound of many footsteps, and Alice looked round, eager to see the Queen.
First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like the three
gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the corners: next the
ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with diamonds, and walked two and
two, as the soldiers did. After these came the royal children; there were ten
of them, and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand in hand, in
couples: they were all ornamented with hearts. Next came the guests, mostly
Kings and Queens, and among them Alice recognised the White Rabbit: it was
talking in a hurried nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and
went by without noticing her. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the
King’s crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this grand
procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.
Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face like
the three gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard of such a
rule at processions; “and besides, what would be the use of a procession,”
thought she, “if people had all to lie down upon their faces, so that they
couldn’t see it?” So she stood still where she was, and waited.
When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked at her,
and the Queen said severely “Who is this?” She said it to the Knave of Hearts,
who only bowed and smiled in reply.
“Idiot!” said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and, turning to Alice,
she went on, “What’s your name, child?”
“My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,” said Alice very politely; but she
added, to herself, “Why, they’re only a pack of cards, after all. I needn’t be
afraid of them!”
“And who are these?” said the Queen, pointing to the three gardeners who
were lying round the rose-tree; for, you see, as they were lying on their
faces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of the pack, she
could not tell whether they were gardeners, or soldiers, or courtiers, or three
of her own children.
“How should I know?” said Alice, surprised at her own courage. “It’s no
business of mine.”
The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a moment like
a wild beast, screamed “Off with her head! Off—”
“Nonsense!” said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen was silent.
The King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said “Consider, my dear: she
is only a child!”
The Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave “Turn them over!”
The Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.
“Get up!” said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the three gardeners
instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the King, the Queen, the royal
children, and everybody else.
“Leave off that!” screamed the Queen. “You make me giddy.” And then, turning to
the rose-tree, she went on, “What have you been doing here?”
“May it please your Majesty,” said Two, in a very humble tone, going down on
one knee as he spoke, “we were trying—”
“I see!” said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the roses.
“Off with their heads!” and the procession moved on, three of the soldiers
remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners, who ran to Alice for
protection.
“You shan’t be beheaded!” said Alice, and she put them into a large flower-pot
that stood near. The three soldiers wandered about for a minute or two, looking
for them, and then quietly marched off after the others.
“Are their heads off?” shouted the Queen.
“Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!” the soldiers shouted in
reply.
“That’s right!” shouted the Queen. “Can you play croquet?”
The soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question was evidently
meant for her.
“Yes!” shouted Alice.
“Come on, then!” roared the Queen, and Alice joined the procession, wondering
very much what would happen next.
“It’s—it’s a very fine day!” said a timid voice at her side. She was walking by
the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face.
“Very,” said Alice: “—where’s the Duchess?”
“Hush! Hush!” said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone. He looked anxiously over
his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised himself upon tiptoe, put his mouth
close to her ear, and whispered “She’s under sentence of execution.”
“What for?” said Alice.
“Did you say ‘What a pity!’?” the Rabbit asked.
“No, I didn’t,” said Alice: “I don’t think it’s at all a pity. I said ‘What
for?’”
“She boxed the Queen’s ears—” the Rabbit began. Alice gave a little scream of
laughter. “Oh, hush!” the Rabbit whispered in a frightened tone. “The Queen
will hear you! You see, she came rather late, and the Queen said—”
“Get to your places!” shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, and people began
running about in all directions, tumbling up against each other; however, they
got settled down in a minute or two, and the game began. Alice thought she had
never seen such a curious croquet-ground in her life; it was all ridges and
furrows; the balls were live hedgehogs, the mallets live flamingoes, and the
soldiers had to double themselves up and to stand on their hands and feet, to
make the arches.
The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo: she
succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough, under her arm,
with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she had got its neck nicely
straightened out, and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head, it
would twist itself round and look up in her face, with such a puzzled
expression that she could not help bursting out laughing: and when she had got
its head down, and was going to begin again, it was very provoking to find that
the hedgehog had unrolled itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides
all this, there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she wanted
to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were always getting up
and walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice soon came to the conclusion
that it was a very difficult game indeed.
The players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling all the
while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short time the Queen was
in a furious passion, and went stamping about, and shouting “Off with his
head!” or “Off with her head!” about once in a minute.
Alice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as yet had any dispute
with the Queen, but she knew that it might happen any minute, “and then,”
thought she, “what would become of me? They’re dreadfully fond of beheading
people here; the great wonder is, that there’s any one left alive!”
She was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she could
get away without being seen, when she noticed a curious appearance in the air:
it puzzled her very much at first, but, after watching it a minute or two, she
made it out to be a grin, and she said to herself “It’s the Cheshire Cat: now I
shall have somebody to talk to.”
“How are you getting on?” said the Cat, as soon as there was mouth enough for
it to speak with.
Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded. “It’s no use speaking to
it,” she thought, “till its ears have come, or at least one of them.” In
another minute the whole head appeared, and then Alice put down her flamingo,
and began an account of the game, feeling very glad she had someone to listen
to her. The Cat seemed to think that there was enough of it now in sight, and
no more of it appeared.
“I don’t think they play at all fairly,” Alice began, in rather a complaining
tone, “and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can’t hear oneself speak—and they
don’t seem to have any rules in particular; at least, if there are, nobody
attends to them—and you’ve no idea how confusing it is all the things being
alive; for instance, there’s the arch I’ve got to go through next walking about
at the other end of the ground—and I should have croqueted the Queen’s hedgehog
just now, only it ran away when it saw mine coming!”
“How do you like the Queen?” said the Cat in a low voice.
“Not at all,” said Alice: “she’s so extremely—” Just then she noticed that the
Queen was close behind her, listening: so she went on, “—likely to win, that
it’s hardly worth while finishing the game.”
The Queen smiled and passed on.
“Who are you talking to?” said the King, going up to Alice, and looking
at the Cat’s head with great curiosity.
“It’s a friend of mine—a Cheshire Cat,” said Alice: “allow me to introduce it.”
“I don’t like the look of it at all,” said the King: “however, it may kiss my
hand if it likes.”
“I’d rather not,” the Cat remarked.
“Don’t be impertinent,” said the King, “and don’t look at me like that!” He got
behind Alice as he spoke.
“A cat may look at a king,” said Alice. “I’ve read that in some book, but I
don’t remember where.”
“Well, it must be removed,” said the King very decidedly, and he called the
Queen, who was passing at the moment, “My dear! I wish you would have this cat
removed!”
The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or small. “Off
with his head!” she said, without even looking round.
“I’ll fetch the executioner myself,” said the King eagerly, and he hurried off.
Alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game was going on, as
she heard the Queen’s voice in the distance, screaming with passion. She had
already heard her sentence three of the players to be executed for having
missed their turns, and she did not like the look of things at all, as the game
was in such confusion that she never knew whether it was her turn or not. So
she went in search of her hedgehog.
The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed to
Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the other: the
only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across to the other side of the
garden, where Alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up
into a tree.
By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight was
over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight: “but it doesn’t matter much,”
thought Alice, “as all the arches are gone from this side of the ground.” So
she tucked it away under her arm, that it might not escape again, and went back
for a little more conversation with her friend.
When she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to find quite a large
crowd collected round it: there was a dispute going on between the executioner,
the King, and the Queen, who were all talking at once, while all the rest were
quite silent, and looked very uncomfortable.
The moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle the
question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as they all spoke
at once, she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly what they said.
The executioner’s argument was, that you couldn’t cut off a head unless there
was a body to cut it off from: that he had never had to do such a thing before,
and he wasn’t going to begin at his time of life.
The King’s argument was, that anything that had a head could be beheaded, and
that you weren’t to talk nonsense.
The Queen’s argument was, that if something wasn’t done about it in less than
no time she’d have everybody executed, all round. (It was this last remark that
had made the whole party look so grave and anxious.)
Alice could think of nothing else to say but “It belongs to the Duchess: you’d
better ask her about it.”
“She’s in prison,” the Queen said to the executioner: “fetch her here.” And the
executioner went off like an arrow.
The Cat’s head began fading away the moment he was gone, and, by the time he
had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely disappeared; so the King and
the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it, while the rest of the
party went back to the game.
“You can’t think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old thing!” said the
Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately into Alice’s, and they walked off
together.
Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and thought to
herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so savage when
they met in the kitchen.
“When I’m a Duchess,” she said to herself, (not in a very hopeful tone
though), “I won’t have any pepper in my kitchen at all. Soup does very
well without—Maybe it’s always pepper that makes people hot-tempered,” she went
on, very much pleased at having found out a new kind of rule, “and vinegar that
makes them sour—and camomile that makes them bitter—and—and barley-sugar and
such things that make children sweet-tempered. I only wish people knew
that: then they wouldn’t be so stingy about it, you know—”
She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a little startled
when she heard her voice close to her ear. “You’re thinking about something, my
dear, and that makes you forget to talk. I can’t tell you just now what the
moral of that is, but I shall remember it in a bit.”
“Perhaps it hasn’t one,” Alice ventured to remark.
“Tut, tut, child!” said the Duchess. “Everything’s got a moral, if only you can
find it.” And she squeezed herself up closer to Alice’s side as she spoke.
Alice did not much like keeping so close to her: first, because the Duchess was
very ugly; and secondly, because she was exactly the right height to
rest her chin upon Alice’s shoulder, and it was an uncomfortably sharp chin.
However, she did not like to be rude, so she bore it as well as she could.
“The game’s going on rather better now,” she said, by way of keeping up the
conversation a little.
“’Tis so,” said the Duchess: “and the moral of that is—‘Oh, ’tis love, ’tis
love, that makes the world go round!’”
“Somebody said,” Alice whispered, “that it’s done by everybody minding their
own business!”
“Ah, well! It means much the same thing,” said the Duchess, digging her sharp
little chin into Alice’s shoulder as she added, “and the moral of that
is—‘Take care of the sense, and the sounds will take care of themselves.’”
“How fond she is of finding morals in things!” Alice thought to herself.
“I dare say you’re wondering why I don’t put my arm round your waist,” the
Duchess said after a pause: “the reason is, that I’m doubtful about the temper
of your flamingo. Shall I try the experiment?”
“He might bite,” Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all anxious to have
the experiment tried.
“Very true,” said the Duchess: “flamingoes and mustard both bite. And the moral
of that is—‘Birds of a feather flock together.’”
“Only mustard isn’t a bird,” Alice remarked.
“Right, as usual,” said the Duchess: “what a clear way you have of putting
things!”
“It’s a mineral, I think,” said Alice.
“Of course it is,” said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree to everything
that Alice said; “there’s a large mustard-mine near here. And the moral of that
is—‘The more there is of mine, the less there is of yours.’”
“Oh, I know!” exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this last remark, “it’s
a vegetable. It doesn’t look like one, but it is.”
“I quite agree with you,” said the Duchess; “and the moral of that is—‘Be what
you would seem to be’—or if you’d like it put more simply—‘Never imagine
yourself not to be otherwise than what it might appear to others that what you
were or might have been was not otherwise than what you had been would have
appeared to them to be otherwise.’”
“I think I should understand that better,” Alice said very politely, “if I had
it written down: but I can’t quite follow it as you say it.”
“That’s nothing to what I could say if I chose,” the Duchess replied, in a
pleased tone.
“Pray don’t trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,” said Alice.
“Oh, don’t talk about trouble!” said the Duchess. “I make you a present of
everything I’ve said as yet.”
“A cheap sort of present!” thought Alice. “I’m glad they don’t give birthday
presents like that!” But she did not venture to say it out loud.
“Thinking again?” the Duchess asked, with another dig of her sharp little chin.
“I’ve a right to think,” said Alice sharply, for she was beginning to feel a
little worried.
“Just about as much right,” said the Duchess, “as pigs have to fly; and the m—”
But here, to Alice’s great surprise, the Duchess’s voice died away, even in the
middle of her favourite word ‘moral,’ and the arm that was linked into hers
began to tremble. Alice looked up, and there stood the Queen in front of them,
with her arms folded, frowning like a thunderstorm.
“A fine day, your Majesty!” the Duchess began in a low, weak voice.
“Now, I give you fair warning,” shouted the Queen, stamping on the ground as
she spoke; “either you or your head must be off, and that in about half no
time! Take your choice!”
The Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment.
“Let’s go on with the game,” the Queen said to Alice; and Alice was too much
frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back to the croquet-ground.
The other guests had taken advantage of the Queen’s absence, and were resting
in the shade: however, the moment they saw her, they hurried back to the game,
the Queen merely remarking that a moment’s delay would cost them their lives.
All the time they were playing the Queen never left off quarrelling with the
other players, and shouting “Off with his head!” or “Off with her head!” Those
whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers, who of course had
to leave off being arches to do this, so that by the end of half an hour or so
there were no arches left, and all the players, except the King, the Queen, and
Alice, were in custody and under sentence of execution.
Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to Alice, “Have you seen
the Mock Turtle yet?”
“No,” said Alice. “I don’t even know what a Mock Turtle is.”
“It’s the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,” said the Queen.
“I never saw one, or heard of one,” said Alice.
“Come on, then,” said the Queen, “and he shall tell you his history.”
As they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low voice, to the
company generally, “You are all pardoned.” “Come, that’s a good thing!”
she said to herself, for she had felt quite unhappy at the number of executions
the Queen had ordered.
They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the sun. (If you don’t
know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.) “Up, lazy thing!” said the Queen,
“and take this young lady to see the Mock Turtle, and to hear his history. I
must go back and see after some executions I have ordered;” and she walked off,
leaving Alice alone with the Gryphon. Alice did not quite like the look of the
creature, but on the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with
it as to go after that savage Queen: so she waited.
The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the Queen till she was
out of sight: then it chuckled. “What fun!” said the Gryphon, half to itself,
half to Alice.
“What is the fun?” said Alice.
“Why, she,” said the Gryphon. “It’s all her fancy, that: they never
executes nobody, you know. Come on!”
“Everybody says ‘come on!’ here,” thought Alice, as she went slowly after it:
“I never was so ordered about in all my life, never!”
They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance, sitting
sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came nearer, Alice could
hear him sighing as if his heart would break. She pitied him deeply. “What is
his sorrow?” she asked the Gryphon, and the Gryphon answered, very nearly in
the same words as before, “It’s all his fancy, that: he hasn’t got no sorrow,
you know. Come on!”
So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes full of
tears, but said nothing.
“This here young lady,” said the Gryphon, “she wants for to know your history,
she do.”
“I’ll tell it her,” said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow tone: “sit down,
both of you, and don’t speak a word till I’ve finished.”
So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes. Alice thought to herself,
“I don’t see how he can ever finish, if he doesn’t begin.” But she
waited patiently.
“Once,” said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, “I was a real Turtle.”
These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an occasional
exclamation of “Hjckrrh!” from the Gryphon, and the constant heavy sobbing of
the Mock Turtle. Alice was very nearly getting up and saying, “Thank you, sir,
for your interesting story,” but she could not help thinking there must
be more to come, so she sat still and said nothing.
“When we were little,” the Mock Turtle went on at last, more calmly, though
still sobbing a little now and then, “we went to school in the sea. The master
was an old Turtle—we used to call him Tortoise—”
“Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn’t one?” Alice asked.
“We called him Tortoise because he taught us,” said the Mock Turtle angrily:
“really you are very dull!”
“You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question,” added
the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and looked at poor Alice, who felt
ready to sink into the earth. At last the Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle,
“Drive on, old fellow! Don’t be all day about it!” and he went on in these
words:
“Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn’t believe it—”
“I never said I didn’t!” interrupted Alice.
“You did,” said the Mock Turtle.
“Hold your tongue!” added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak again. The Mock
Turtle went on.
“We had the best of educations—in fact, we went to school every day—”
“I’ve been to a day-school, too,” said Alice; “you needn’t be so proud
as all that.”
“With extras?” asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.
“Yes,” said Alice, “we learned French and music.”
“And washing?” said the Mock Turtle.
“Certainly not!” said Alice indignantly.
“Ah! then yours wasn’t a really good school,” said the Mock Turtle in a tone of
great relief. “Now at ours they had at the end of the bill, ‘French,
music, and washing—extra.’”
“You couldn’t have wanted it much,” said Alice; “living at the bottom of the
sea.”
“I couldn’t afford to learn it.” said the Mock Turtle with a sigh. “I only took
the regular course.”
“What was that?” inquired Alice.
“Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,” the Mock Turtle replied; “and
then the different branches of Arithmetic—Ambition, Distraction, Uglification,
and Derision.”
“I never heard of ‘Uglification,’” Alice ventured to say. “What is it?”
The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise. “What! Never heard of
uglifying!” it exclaimed. “You know what to beautify is, I suppose?”
“Yes,” said Alice doubtfully: “it means—to—make—anything—prettier.”
“Well, then,” the Gryphon went on, “if you don’t know what to uglify is, you
are a simpleton.”
Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it, so she turned
to the Mock Turtle, and said “What else had you to learn?”
“Well, there was Mystery,” the Mock Turtle replied, counting off the subjects
on his flappers, “—Mystery, ancient and modern, with Seaography: then
Drawling—the Drawling-master was an old conger-eel, that used to come once a
week: he taught us Drawling, Stretching, and Fainting in Coils.”
“What was that like?” said Alice.
“Well, I can’t show it you myself,” the Mock Turtle said: “I’m too stiff. And
the Gryphon never learnt it.”
“Hadn’t time,” said the Gryphon: “I went to the Classics master, though. He was
an old crab, he was.”
“I never went to him,” the Mock Turtle said with a sigh: “he taught Laughing
and Grief, they used to say.”
“So he did, so he did,” said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn; and both
creatures hid their faces in their paws.
“And how many hours a day did you do lessons?” said Alice, in a hurry to change
the subject.
“Ten hours the first day,” said the Mock Turtle: “nine the next, and so on.”
“What a curious plan!” exclaimed Alice.
“That’s the reason they’re called lessons,” the Gryphon remarked: “because they
lessen from day to day.”
This was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a little before she
made her next remark. “Then the eleventh day must have been a holiday?”
“Of course it was,” said the Mock Turtle.
“And how did you manage on the twelfth?” Alice went on eagerly.
“That’s enough about lessons,” the Gryphon interrupted in a very decided tone:
“tell her something about the games now.”
The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper across his
eyes. He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for a minute or two sobs
choked his voice. “Same as if he had a bone in his throat,” said the Gryphon:
and it set to work shaking him and punching him in the back. At last the Mock
Turtle recovered his voice, and, with tears running down his cheeks, he went on
again:—
“You may not have lived much under the sea—” (“I haven’t,” said Alice)—“and
perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster—” (Alice began to say “I
once tasted—” but checked herself hastily, and said “No, never”) “—so you can
have no idea what a delightful thing a Lobster Quadrille is!”
“No, indeed,” said Alice. “What sort of a dance is it?”
“Why,” said the Gryphon, “you first form into a line along the sea-shore—”
“Two lines!” cried the Mock Turtle. “Seals, turtles, salmon, and so on; then,
when you’ve cleared all the jelly-fish out of the way—”
“That generally takes some time,” interrupted the Gryphon.
“—you advance twice—”
“Each with a lobster as a partner!” cried the Gryphon.
“Of course,” the Mock Turtle said: “advance twice, set to partners—”
“—change lobsters, and retire in same order,” continued the Gryphon.
“Then, you know,” the Mock Turtle went on, “you throw the—”
“The lobsters!” shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.
“—as far out to sea as you can—”
“Swim after them!” screamed the Gryphon.
“Turn a somersault in the sea!” cried the Mock Turtle, capering wildly about.
“Change lobsters again!” yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice.
“Back to land again, and that’s all the first figure,” said the Mock Turtle,
suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures, who had been jumping about
like mad things all this time, sat down again very sadly and quietly, and
looked at Alice.
“It must be a very pretty dance,” said Alice timidly.
“Would you like to see a little of it?” said the Mock Turtle.
“Very much indeed,” said Alice.
“Come, let’s try the first figure!” said the Mock Turtle to the Gryphon. “We
can do without lobsters, you know. Which shall sing?”
“Oh, you sing,” said the Gryphon. “I’ve forgotten the words.”
So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now and then
treading on her toes when they passed too close, and waving their forepaws to
mark the time, while the Mock Turtle sang this, very slowly and sadly:—
“Will you walk a little faster?” said a whiting to a snail.
“There’s a porpoise close behind us, and he’s treading on my tail.
See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!
They are waiting on the shingle—will you come and join the dance?
Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, will you join the dance?
Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, won’t you join the dance?

“You can really have no notion how delightful it will be
When they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to sea!”
But the snail replied “Too far, too far!” and gave a look askance—
Said he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the dance.
Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join the dance.
Would not, could not, would not, could not, could not join the dance.

“What matters it how far we go?” his scaly friend replied.
“There is another shore, you know, upon the other side.
The further off from England the nearer is to France—
Then turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance.
Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, will you join the dance?
Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, won’t you join the dance?”
“Thank you, it’s a very interesting dance to watch,” said Alice, feeling very
glad that it was over at last: “and I do so like that curious song about the
whiting!”
“Oh, as to the whiting,” said the Mock Turtle, “they—you’ve seen them, of
course?”
“Yes,” said Alice, “I’ve often seen them at dinn—” she checked herself hastily.
“I don’t know where Dinn may be,” said the Mock Turtle, “but if you’ve seen
them so often, of course you know what they’re like.”
“I believe so,” Alice replied thoughtfully. “They have their tails in their
mouths—and they’re all over crumbs.”
“You’re wrong about the crumbs,” said the Mock Turtle: “crumbs would all wash
off in the sea. But they have their tails in their mouths; and the
reason is—” here the Mock Turtle yawned and shut his eyes.—“Tell her about the
reason and all that,” he said to the Gryphon.
“The reason is,” said the Gryphon, “that they would go with the lobsters
to the dance. So they got thrown out to sea. So they had to fall a long way. So
they got their tails fast in their mouths. So they couldn’t get them out again.
That’s all.”
“Thank you,” said Alice, “it’s very interesting. I never knew so much about a
whiting before.”
“I can tell you more than that, if you like,” said the Gryphon. “Do you know
why it’s called a whiting?”
“I never thought about it,” said Alice. “Why?”
“It does the boots and shoes,” the Gryphon replied very solemnly.
Alice was thoroughly puzzled. “Does the boots and shoes!” she repeated in a
wondering tone.
“Why, what are your shoes done with?” said the Gryphon. “I mean, what
makes them so shiny?”
Alice looked down at them, and considered a little before she gave her answer.
“They’re done with blacking, I believe.”
“Boots and shoes under the sea,” the Gryphon went on in a deep voice, “are done
with a whiting. Now you know.”
“And what are they made of?” Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity.
“Soles and eels, of course,” the Gryphon replied rather impatiently: “any
shrimp could have told you that.”
“If I’d been the whiting,” said Alice, whose thoughts were still running on the
song, “I’d have said to the porpoise, ‘Keep back, please: we don’t want
you with us!’”
“They were obliged to have him with them,” the Mock Turtle said: “no wise fish
would go anywhere without a porpoise.”
“Wouldn’t it really?” said Alice in a tone of great surprise.
“Of course not,” said the Mock Turtle: “why, if a fish came to me, and
told me he was going a journey, I should say ‘With what porpoise?’”
“Don’t you mean ‘purpose’?” said Alice.
“I mean what I say,” the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone. And the
Gryphon added “Come, let’s hear some of your adventures.”
“I could tell you my adventures—beginning from this morning,” said Alice a
little timidly: “but it’s no use going back to yesterday, because I was a
different person then.”
“Explain all that,” said the Mock Turtle.
“No, no! The adventures first,” said the Gryphon in an impatient tone:
“explanations take such a dreadful time.”
So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first saw the
White Rabbit. She was a little nervous about it just at first, the two
creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened their eyes and
mouths so very wide, but she gained courage as she went on. Her
listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part about her repeating
“You are old, Father William,” to the Caterpillar, and the words all
coming different, and then the Mock Turtle drew a long breath, and said “That’s
very curious.”
“It’s all about as curious as it can be,” said the Gryphon.
“It all came different!” the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully. “I should like
to hear her try and repeat something now. Tell her to begin.” He looked at the
Gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of authority over Alice.
“Stand up and repeat ‘’Tis the voice of the sluggard,’” said the
Gryphon.
“How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat lessons!” thought
Alice; “I might as well be at school at once.” However, she got up, and began
to repeat it, but her head was so full of the Lobster Quadrille, that she
hardly knew what she was saying, and the words came very queer indeed:—
“’Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare,
“You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair.”
As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose
Trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.”

[later editions continued as follows
When the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark,
And will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark,
But, when the tide rises and sharks are around,
His voice has a timid and tremulous sound.]
“That’s different from what I used to say when I was a child,” said the
Gryphon.
“Well, I never heard it before,” said the Mock Turtle; “but it sounds uncommon
nonsense.”
Alice said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her hands, wondering if
anything would ever happen in a natural way again.
“I should like to have it explained,” said the Mock Turtle.
“She can’t explain it,” said the Gryphon hastily. “Go on with the next verse.”
“But about his toes?” the Mock Turtle persisted. “How could he turn them
out with his nose, you know?”
“It’s the first position in dancing.” Alice said; but was dreadfully puzzled by
the whole thing, and longed to change the subject.
“Go on with the next verse,” the Gryphon repeated impatiently: “it begins ‘I
passed by his garden.’”
Alice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would all come wrong,
and she went on in a trembling voice:—
“I passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye,
How the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie—”

[later editions continued as follows
The Panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat,
While the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat.
When the pie was all finished, the Owl, as a boon,
Was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon:
While the Panther received knife and fork with a growl,
And concluded the banquet—]
“What is the use of repeating all that stuff,” the Mock Turtle
interrupted, “if you don’t explain it as you go on? It’s by far the most
confusing thing I ever heard!”
“Yes, I think you’d better leave off,” said the Gryphon: and Alice was only too
glad to do so.
“Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille?” the Gryphon went on.
“Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you a song?”
“Oh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind,” Alice replied, so
eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather offended tone, “Hm! No accounting
for tastes! Sing her ‘Turtle Soup,’ will you, old fellow?”
The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes choked with
sobs, to sing this:—
“Beautiful Soup, so rich and green,
Waiting in a hot tureen!
Who for such dainties would not stoop?
Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!
Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!
    Beau—ootiful Soo—oop!
    Beau—ootiful Soo—oop!
Soo—oop of the e—e—evening,
    Beautiful, beautiful Soup!

“Beautiful Soup! Who cares for fish,
Game, or any other dish?
Who would not give all else for two p
ennyworth only of beautiful Soup?
Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?
    Beau—ootiful Soo—oop!
    Beau—ootiful Soo—oop!
Soo—oop of the e—e—evening,
    Beautiful, beauti—FUL SOUP!”
“Chorus again!” cried the Gryphon, and the Mock Turtle had just begun to repeat
it, when a cry of “The trial’s beginning!” was heard in the distance.
“Come on!” cried the Gryphon, and, taking Alice by the hand, it hurried off,
without waiting for the end of the song.
“What trial is it?” Alice panted as she ran; but the Gryphon only answered
“Come on!” and ran the faster, while more and more faintly came, carried on the
breeze that followed them, the melancholy words:—
“Soo—oop of the e—e—evening,
    Beautiful, beautiful Soup!”
The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they arrived,
with a great crowd assembled about them—all sorts of little birds and beasts,
as well as the whole pack of cards: the Knave was standing before them, in
chains, with a soldier on each side to guard him; and near the King was the
White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one hand, and a scroll of parchment in the
other. In the very middle of the court was a table, with a large dish of tarts
upon it: they looked so good, that it made Alice quite hungry to look at
them—“I wish they’d get the trial done,” she thought, “and hand round the
refreshments!” But there seemed to be no chance of this, so she began looking
at everything about her, to pass away the time.
Alice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had read about them
in books, and she was quite pleased to find that she knew the name of nearly
everything there. “That’s the judge,” she said to herself, “because of his
great wig.”
The judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown over the wig,
(look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it,) he did not look at
all comfortable, and it was certainly not becoming.
“And that’s the jury-box,” thought Alice, “and those twelve creatures,” (she
was obliged to say “creatures,” you see, because some of them were animals, and
some were birds,) “I suppose they are the jurors.” She said this last word two
or three times over to herself, being rather proud of it: for she thought, and
rightly too, that very few little girls of her age knew the meaning of it at
all. However, “jury-men” would have done just as well.
The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates. “What are they
doing?” Alice whispered to the Gryphon. “They can’t have anything to put down
yet, before the trial’s begun.”
“They’re putting down their names,” the Gryphon whispered in reply, “for fear
they should forget them before the end of the trial.”
“Stupid things!” Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but she stopped
hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, “Silence in the court!” and the King
put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round, to make out who was talking.
Alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders, that all
the jurors were writing down “stupid things!” on their slates, and she could
even make out that one of them didn’t know how to spell “stupid,” and that he
had to ask his neighbour to tell him. “A nice muddle their slates’ll be in
before the trial’s over!” thought Alice.
One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This of course, Alice could
not stand, and she went round the court and got behind him, and very
soon found an opportunity of taking it away. She did it so quickly that the
poor little juror (it was Bill, the Lizard) could not make out at all what had
become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he was obliged to write with
one finger for the rest of the day; and this was of very little use, as it left
no mark on the slate.
“Herald, read the accusation!” said the King.
On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then unrolled
the parchment scroll, and read as follows:—
“The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,
    All on a summer day:
The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,
    And took them quite away!”
“Consider your verdict,” the King said to the jury.
“Not yet, not yet!” the Rabbit hastily interrupted. “There’s a great deal to
come before that!”
“Call the first witness,” said the King; and the White Rabbit blew three blasts
on the trumpet, and called out, “First witness!”
The first witness was the Hatter. He came in with a teacup in one hand and a
piece of bread-and-butter in the other. “I beg pardon, your Majesty,” he began,
“for bringing these in: but I hadn’t quite finished my tea when I was sent
for.”
“You ought to have finished,” said the King. “When did you begin?”
The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into the court,
arm-in-arm with the Dormouse. “Fourteenth of March, I think it was,” he
said.
“Fifteenth,” said the March Hare.
“Sixteenth,” added the Dormouse.
“Write that down,” the King said to the jury, and the jury eagerly wrote down
all three dates on their slates, and then added them up, and reduced the answer
to shillings and pence.
“Take off your hat,” the King said to the Hatter.
“It isn’t mine,” said the Hatter.
“Stolen!” the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who instantly made a
memorandum of the fact.
“I keep them to sell,” the Hatter added as an explanation; “I’ve none of my
own. I’m a hatter.”
Here the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the Hatter, who
turned pale and fidgeted.
“Give your evidence,” said the King; “and don’t be nervous, or I’ll have you
executed on the spot.”
This did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept shifting from one
foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and in his confusion he bit a
large piece out of his teacup instead of the bread-and-butter.
Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled her a
good deal until she made out what it was: she was beginning to grow larger
again, and she thought at first she would get up and leave the court; but on
second thoughts she decided to remain where she was as long as there was room
for her.
“I wish you wouldn’t squeeze so,” said the Dormouse, who was sitting next to
her. “I can hardly breathe.”
“I can’t help it,” said Alice very meekly: “I’m growing.”
“You’ve no right to grow here,” said the Dormouse.
“Don’t talk nonsense,” said Alice more boldly: “you know you’re growing too.”
“Yes, but I grow at a reasonable pace,” said the Dormouse: “not in that
ridiculous fashion.” And he got up very sulkily and crossed over to the other
side of the court.
All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter, and, just as
the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to one of the officers of the court,
“Bring me the list of the singers in the last concert!” on which the wretched
Hatter trembled so, that he shook both his shoes off.
“Give your evidence,” the King repeated angrily, “or I’ll have you executed,
whether you’re nervous or not.”
“I’m a poor man, your Majesty,” the Hatter began, in a trembling voice, “—and I
hadn’t begun my tea—not above a week or so—and what with the bread-and-butter
getting so thin—and the twinkling of the tea—”
“The twinkling of the what?” said the King.
“It began with the tea,” the Hatter replied.
“Of course twinkling begins with a T!” said the King sharply. “Do you take me
for a dunce? Go on!”
“I’m a poor man,” the Hatter went on, “and most things twinkled after that—only
the March Hare said—”
“I didn’t!” the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.
“You did!” said the Hatter.
“I deny it!” said the March Hare.
“He denies it,” said the King: “leave out that part.”
“Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said—” the Hatter went on, looking anxiously
round to see if he would deny it too: but the Dormouse denied nothing, being
fast asleep.
“After that,” continued the Hatter, “I cut some more bread-and-butter—”
“But what did the Dormouse say?” one of the jury asked.
“That I can’t remember,” said the Hatter.
“You must remember,” remarked the King, “or I’ll have you executed.”
The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter, and went down on
one knee. “I’m a poor man, your Majesty,” he began.
“You’re a very poor speaker,” said the King.
Here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately suppressed by the
officers of the court. (As that is rather a hard word, I will just explain to
you how it was done. They had a large canvas bag, which tied up at the mouth
with strings: into this they slipped the guinea-pig, head first, and then sat
upon it.)
“I’m glad I’ve seen that done,” thought Alice. “I’ve so often read in the
newspapers, at the end of trials, “There was some attempt at applause, which
was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court,” and I never
understood what it meant till now.”
“If that’s all you know about it, you may stand down,” continued the King.
“I can’t go no lower,” said the Hatter: “I’m on the floor, as it is.”
“Then you may sit down,” the King replied.
Here the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed.
“Come, that finished the guinea-pigs!” thought Alice. “Now we shall get on
better.”
“I’d rather finish my tea,” said the Hatter, with an anxious look at the Queen,
who was reading the list of singers.
“You may go,” said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the court, without
even waiting to put his shoes on.
“—and just take his head off outside,” the Queen added to one of the officers:
but the Hatter was out of sight before the officer could get to the door.
“Call the next witness!” said the King.
The next witness was the Duchess’s cook. She carried the pepper-box in her
hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before she got into the court, by the
way the people near the door began sneezing all at once.
“Give your evidence,” said the King.
“Shan’t,” said the cook.
The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a low voice, “Your
Majesty must cross-examine this witness.”
“Well, if I must, I must,” the King said, with a melancholy air, and, after
folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were nearly out of
sight, he said in a deep voice, “What are tarts made of?”
“Pepper, mostly,” said the cook.
“Treacle,” said a sleepy voice behind her.
“Collar that Dormouse,” the Queen shrieked out. “Behead that Dormouse! Turn
that Dormouse out of court! Suppress him! Pinch him! Off with his whiskers!”
For some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the Dormouse turned
out, and, by the time they had settled down again, the cook had disappeared.
“Never mind!” said the King, with an air of great relief. “Call the next
witness.” And he added in an undertone to the Queen, “Really, my dear,
you must cross-examine the next witness. It quite makes my forehead
ache!”
Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list, feeling very
curious to see what the next witness would be like, “—for they haven’t got much
evidence yet,” she said to herself. Imagine her surprise, when the White
Rabbit read out, at the top of his shrill little voice, the name “Alice!”
“Here!” cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how large she
had grown in the last few minutes, and she jumped up in such a hurry that she
tipped over the jury-box with the edge of her skirt, upsetting all the jurymen
on to the heads of the crowd below, and there they lay sprawling about,
reminding her very much of a globe of goldfish she had accidentally upset the
week before.
“Oh, I beg your pardon!” she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay, and
began picking them up again as quickly as she could, for the accident of the
goldfish kept running in her head, and she had a vague sort of idea that they
must be collected at once and put back into the jury-box, or they would die.
“The trial cannot proceed,” said the King in a very grave voice, “until all the
jurymen are back in their proper places—all,” he repeated with great
emphasis, looking hard at Alice as he said so.
Alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she had put the
Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing was waving its tail about
in a melancholy way, being quite unable to move. She soon got it out again, and
put it right; “not that it signifies much,” she said to herself; “I should
think it would be quite as much use in the trial one way up as the
other.”
As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being upset, and
their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to them, they set to
work very diligently to write out a history of the accident, all except the
Lizard, who seemed too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth
open, gazing up into the roof of the court.
“What do you know about this business?” the King said to Alice.
“Nothing,” said Alice.
“Nothing whatever?” persisted the King.
“Nothing whatever,” said Alice.
“That’s very important,” the King said, turning to the jury. They were just
beginning to write this down on their slates, when the White Rabbit
interrupted: “Unimportant, your Majesty means, of course,” he said in a
very respectful tone, but frowning and making faces at him as he spoke.
“Unimportant, of course, I meant,” the King hastily said, and went on to
himself in an undertone,
“important—unimportant—unimportant—important—” as if he were trying which word
sounded best.
Some of the jury wrote it down “important,” and some “unimportant.” Alice could
see this, as she was near enough to look over their slates; “but it doesn’t
matter a bit,” she thought to herself.
At this moment the King, who had been for some time busily writing in his
note-book, cackled out “Silence!” and read out from his book, “Rule Forty-two.
All persons more than a mile high to leave the court.”
Everybody looked at Alice.
“I’m not a mile high,” said Alice.
“You are,” said the King.
“Nearly two miles high,” added the Queen.
“Well, I shan’t go, at any rate,” said Alice: “besides, that’s not a regular
rule: you invented it just now.”
“It’s the oldest rule in the book,” said the King.
“Then it ought to be Number One,” said Alice.
The King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily. “Consider your verdict,”
he said to the jury, in a low, trembling voice.
“There’s more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,” said the White
Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; “this paper has just been picked up.”
“What’s in it?” said the Queen.
“I haven’t opened it yet,” said the White Rabbit, “but it seems to be a letter,
written by the prisoner to—to somebody.”
“It must have been that,” said the King, “unless it was written to nobody,
which isn’t usual, you know.”
“Who is it directed to?” said one of the jurymen.
“It isn’t directed at all,” said the White Rabbit; “in fact, there’s nothing
written on the outside.” He unfolded the paper as he spoke, and added
“It isn’t a letter, after all: it’s a set of verses.”
“Are they in the prisoner’s handwriting?” asked another of the jurymen.
“No, they’re not,” said the White Rabbit, “and that’s the queerest thing about
it.” (The jury all looked puzzled.)
“He must have imitated somebody else’s hand,” said the King. (The jury all
brightened up again.)
“Please your Majesty,” said the Knave, “I didn’t write it, and they can’t prove
I did: there’s no name signed at the end.”
“If you didn’t sign it,” said the King, “that only makes the matter worse. You
must have meant some mischief, or else you’d have signed your name like
an honest man.”
There was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the first really clever
thing the King had said that day.
“That proves his guilt,” said the Queen.
“It proves nothing of the sort!” said Alice. “Why, you don’t even know what
they’re about!”
“Read them,” said the King.
The White Rabbit put on his spectacles. “Where shall I begin, please your
Majesty?” he asked.
“Begin at the beginning,” the King said gravely, “and go on till you come to
the end: then stop.”
These were the verses the White Rabbit read:—
“They told me you had been to her,
    And mentioned me to him:
She gave me a good character,
    But said I could not swim.

He sent them word I had not gone
    (We know it to be true):
If she should push the matter on,
    What would become of you?

I gave her one, they gave him two,
    You gave us three or more;
They all returned from him to you,
    Though they were mine before.

If I or she should chance to be
    Involved in this affair,
He trusts to you to set them free,
    Exactly as we were.

My notion was that you had been
    (Before she had this fit)
An obstacle that came between
    Him, and ourselves, and it.

Don’t let him know she liked them best,
    For this must ever be
A secret, kept from all the rest,
    Between yourself and me.”
“That’s the most important piece of evidence we’ve heard yet,” said the King,
rubbing his hands; “so now let the jury—”
“If any one of them can explain it,” said Alice, (she had grown so large in the
last few minutes that she wasn’t a bit afraid of interrupting him), “I’ll give
him sixpence. I don’t believe there’s an atom of meaning in it.”
The jury all wrote down on their slates, “She doesn’t believe there’s an
atom of meaning in it,” but none of them attempted to explain the paper.
“If there’s no meaning in it,” said the King, “that saves a world of trouble,
you know, as we needn’t try to find any. And yet I don’t know,” he went on,
spreading out the verses on his knee, and looking at them with one eye; “I seem
to see some meaning in them, after all. “—said I could not swim—” you
can’t swim, can you?” he added, turning to the Knave.
The Knave shook his head sadly. “Do I look like it?” he said. (Which he
certainly did not, being made entirely of cardboard.)
“All right, so far,” said the King, and he went on muttering over the verses to
himself: “‘We know it to be true—’ that’s the jury, of course—‘I gave
her one, they gave him two—’ why, that must be what he did with the tarts,
you know—”
“But, it goes on ‘they all returned from him to you,’” said Alice.
“Why, there they are!” said the King triumphantly, pointing to the tarts on the
table. “Nothing can be clearer than that. Then again—‘before she had
this fit—’ you never had fits, my dear, I think?” he said to the Queen.
“Never!” said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the Lizard as she
spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his slate with one
finger, as he found it made no mark; but he now hastily began again, using the
ink, that was trickling down his face, as long as it lasted.)
“Then the words don’t fit you,” said the King, looking round the court
with a smile. There was a dead silence.
“It’s a pun!” the King added in an offended tone, and everybody laughed, “Let
the jury consider their verdict.” the King said, for about the twentieth time
that day.
“No, no!” said the Queen. “Sentence first—verdict afterwards.”
“Stuff and nonsense!” said Alice loudly. “The idea of having the sentence
first!”
“Hold your tongue!” said the Queen, turning purple.
“I won’t!” said Alice.
“Off with her head!” the Queen shouted at the top of her voice. Nobody moved.
“Who cares for you?” said Alice, (she had grown to her full size by this time).
“You’re nothing but a pack of cards!”
At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon her: she
gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and tried to beat them
off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her head in the lap of her
sister, who was gently brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down
from the trees upon her face.
“Wake up, Alice dear!” said her sister; “Why, what a long sleep you’ve had!”
“Oh, I’ve had such a curious dream!” said Alice, and she told her sister, as
well as she could remember them, all these strange Adventures of hers that you
have just been reading about; and when she had finished, her sister kissed her,
and said, “It was a curious dream, dear, certainly: but now run in to
your tea; it’s getting late.” So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she
ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been.
But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her hand,
watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all her wonderful
Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion, and this was her
dream:—
First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny hands were
clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were looking up into hers—she
could hear the very tones of her voice, and see that queer little toss of her
head to keep back the wandering hair that would always get into her
eyes—and still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place around her
became alive with the strange creatures of her little sister’s dream.
The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by—the
frightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool—she could hear
the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends shared their
never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her
unfortunate guests to execution—once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the
Duchess’s knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it—once more the shriek
of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard’s slate-pencil, and the choking of
the suppressed guinea-pigs, filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of
the miserable Mock Turtle.
So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in Wonderland,
though she knew she had but to open them again, and all would change to dull
reality—the grass would be only rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to
the waving of the reeds—the rattling teacups would change to tinkling
sheep-bells, and the Queen’s shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd boy—and
the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and all the other queer
noises, would change (she knew) to the confused clamour of the busy
farm-yard—while the lowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place
of the Mock Turtle’s heavy sobs.
Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers would, in
the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would keep, through all
her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her childhood: and how she
would gather about her other little children, and make their eyes bright
and eager with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of Wonderland
of long ago: and how she would feel with all their simple sorrows, and find a
pleasure in all their simple joys, remembering her own child-life, and the
happy summer days.

TO

MY DEAR FRIEND

HOMMY-BEG
How these papers have been placed in sequence will be made manifest in the
reading of them. All needless matters have been eliminated, so that a history
almost at variance with the possibilities of later-day belief may stand forth
as simple fact. There is throughout no statement of past things wherein memory
may err, for all the records chosen are exactly contemporary, given from the
standpoints and within the range of knowledge of those who made them.
(Kept in shorthand.)
3 May. Bistritz.—Left Munich at 8:35 P. M., on 1st May, arriving at
Vienna early next morning; should have arrived at 6:46, but train was an
hour late. Buda-Pesth seems a wonderful place, from the glimpse which I
got of it from the train and the little I could walk through the
streets. I feared to go very far from the station, as we had arrived
late and would start as near the correct time as possible. The
impression I had was that we were leaving the West and entering the
East; the most western of splendid bridges over the Danube, which is
here of noble width and depth, took us among the traditions of Turkish
rule.
We left in pretty good time, and came after nightfall to Klausenburgh.
Here I stopped for the night at the Hotel Royale. I had for dinner, or
rather supper, a chicken done up some way with red pepper, which was
very good but thirsty. (Mem., get recipe for Mina.) I asked the
waiter, and he said it was called “paprika hendl,” and that, as it was a
national dish, I should be able to get it anywhere along the
Carpathians. I found my smattering of German very useful here; indeed, I
don’t know how I should be able to get on without it.
Having had some time at my disposal when in London, I had visited the
British Museum, and made search among the books and maps in the library
regarding Transylvania; it had struck me that some foreknowledge of the
country could hardly fail to have some importance in dealing with a
nobleman of that country. I find that the district he named is in the
extreme east of the country, just on the borders of three states,
Transylvania, Moldavia and Bukovina, in the midst of the Carpathian
mountains; one of the wildest and least known portions of Europe. I was
not able to light on any map or work giving the exact locality of the
Castle Dracula, as there are no maps of this country as yet to compare
with our own Ordnance Survey maps; but I found that Bistritz, the post
town named by Count Dracula, is a fairly well-known place. I shall enter
here some of my notes, as they may refresh my memory when I talk over my
travels with Mina.
In the population of Transylvania there are four distinct nationalities:
Saxons in the South, and mixed with them the Wallachs, who are the
descendants of the Dacians; Magyars in the West, and Szekelys in the
East and North. I am going among the latter, who claim to be descended
from Attila and the Huns. This may be so, for when the Magyars conquered
the country in the eleventh century they found the Huns settled in it. I
read that every known superstition in the world is gathered into the
horseshoe of the Carpathians, as if it were the centre of some sort of
imaginative whirlpool; if so my stay may be very interesting. (Mem., I
must ask the Count all about them.)
I did not sleep well, though my bed was comfortable enough, for I had
all sorts of queer dreams. There was a dog howling all night under my
window, which may have had something to do with it; or it may have been
the paprika, for I had to drink up all the water in my carafe, and was
still thirsty. Towards morning I slept and was wakened by the continuous
knocking at my door, so I guess I must have been sleeping soundly then.
I had for breakfast more paprika, and a sort of porridge of maize flour
which they said was “mamaliga,” and egg-plant stuffed with forcemeat, a
very excellent dish, which they call “impletata.” (Mem., get recipe
for this also.) I had to hurry breakfast, for the train started a little
before eight, or rather it ought to have done so, for after rushing to
the station at 7:30 I had to sit in the carriage for more than an hour
before we began to move. It seems to me that the further east you go the
more unpunctual are the trains. What ought they to be in China?
All day long we seemed to dawdle through a country which was full of
beauty of every kind. Sometimes we saw little towns or castles on the
top of steep hills such as we see in old missals; sometimes we ran by
rivers and streams which seemed from the wide stony margin on each side
of them to be subject to great floods. It takes a lot of water, and
running strong, to sweep the outside edge of a river clear. At every
station there were groups of people, sometimes crowds, and in all sorts
of attire. Some of them were just like the peasants at home or those I
saw coming through France and Germany, with short jackets and round hats
and home-made trousers; but others were very picturesque. The women
looked pretty, except when you got near them, but they were very clumsy
about the waist. They had all full white sleeves of some kind or other,
and most of them had big belts with a lot of strips of something
fluttering from them like the dresses in a ballet, but of course there
were petticoats under them. The strangest figures we saw were the
Slovaks, who were more barbarian than the rest, with their big cow-boy
hats, great baggy dirty-white trousers, white linen shirts, and enormous
heavy leather belts, nearly a foot wide, all studded over with brass
nails. They wore high boots, with their trousers tucked into them, and
had long black hair and heavy black moustaches. They are very
picturesque, but do not look prepossessing. On the stage they would be
set down at once as some old Oriental band of brigands. They are,
however, I am told, very harmless and rather wanting in natural
self-assertion.
It was on the dark side of twilight when we got to Bistritz, which is a
very interesting old place. Being practically on the frontier—for the
Borgo Pass leads from it into Bukovina—it has had a very stormy
existence, and it certainly shows marks of it. Fifty years ago a series
of great fires took place, which made terrible havoc on five separate
occasions. At the very beginning of the seventeenth century it underwent
a siege of three weeks and lost 13,000 people, the casualties of war
proper being assisted by famine and disease.
Count Dracula had directed me to go to the Golden Krone Hotel, which I
found, to my great delight, to be thoroughly old-fashioned, for of
course I wanted to see all I could of the ways of the country. I was
evidently expected, for when I got near the door I faced a
cheery-looking elderly woman in the usual peasant dress—white
undergarment with long double apron, front, and back, of coloured stuff
fitting almost too tight for modesty. When I came close she bowed and
said, “The Herr Englishman?” “Yes,” I said, “Jonathan Harker.” She
smiled, and gave some message to an elderly man in white shirt-sleeves,
who had followed her to the door. He went, but immediately returned with
a letter:—
“My Friend.—Welcome to the Carpathians. I am anxiously expecting
you. Sleep well to-night. At three to-morrow the diligence will
start for Bukovina; a place on it is kept for you. At the Borgo
Pass my carriage will await you and will bring you to me. I trust
that your journey from London has been a happy one, and that you
will enjoy your stay in my beautiful land.
“Your friend,
“Dracula.”
4 May.—I found that my landlord had got a letter from the Count,
directing him to secure the best place on the coach for me; but on
making inquiries as to details he seemed somewhat reticent, and
pretended that he could not understand my German. This could not be
true, because up to then he had understood it perfectly; at least, he
answered my questions exactly as if he did. He and his wife, the old
lady who had received me, looked at each other in a frightened sort of
way. He mumbled out that the money had been sent in a letter, and that
was all he knew. When I asked him if he knew Count Dracula, and could
tell me anything of his castle, both he and his wife crossed themselves,
and, saying that they knew nothing at all, simply refused to speak
further. It was so near the time of starting that I had no time to ask
any one else, for it was all very mysterious and not by any means
comforting.
Just before I was leaving, the old lady came up to my room and said in a
very hysterical way:
“Must you go? Oh! young Herr, must you go?” She was in such an excited
state that she seemed to have lost her grip of what German she knew, and
mixed it all up with some other language which I did not know at all. I
was just able to follow her by asking many questions. When I told her
that I must go at once, and that I was engaged on important business,
she asked again:
“Do you know what day it is?” I answered that it was the fourth of May.
She shook her head as she said again:
“Oh, yes! I know that! I know that, but do you know what day it is?” On
my saying that I did not understand, she went on:
“It is the eve of St. George’s Day. Do you not know that to-night, when
the clock strikes midnight, all the evil things in the world will have
full sway? Do you know where you are going, and what you are going to?”
She was in such evident distress that I tried to comfort her, but
without effect. Finally she went down on her knees and implored me not
to go; at least to wait a day or two before starting. It was all very
ridiculous but I did not feel comfortable. However, there was business
to be done, and I could allow nothing to interfere with it. I therefore
tried to raise her up, and said, as gravely as I could, that I thanked
her, but my duty was imperative, and that I must go. She then rose and
dried her eyes, and taking a crucifix from her neck offered it to me. I
did not know what to do, for, as an English Churchman, I have been
taught to regard such things as in some measure idolatrous, and yet it
seemed so ungracious to refuse an old lady meaning so well and in such a
state of mind. She saw, I suppose, the doubt in my face, for she put the
rosary round my neck, and said, “For your mother’s sake,” and went out
of the room. I am writing up this part of the diary whilst I am waiting
for the coach, which is, of course, late; and the crucifix is still
round my neck. Whether it is the old lady’s fear, or the many ghostly
traditions of this place, or the crucifix itself, I do not know, but I
am not feeling nearly as easy in my mind as usual. If this book should
ever reach Mina before I do, let it bring my good-bye. Here comes the
coach!

5 May. The Castle.—The grey of the morning has passed, and the sun is
high over the distant horizon, which seems jagged, whether with trees or
hills I know not, for it is so far off that big things and little are
mixed. I am not sleepy, and, as I am not to be called till I awake,
naturally I write till sleep comes. There are many odd things to put
down, and, lest who reads them may fancy that I dined too well before I
left Bistritz, let me put down my dinner exactly. I dined on what they
called “robber steak”—bits of bacon, onion, and beef, seasoned with red
pepper, and strung on sticks and roasted over the fire, in the simple
style of the London cat’s meat! The wine was Golden Mediasch, which
produces a queer sting on the tongue, which is, however, not
disagreeable. I had only a couple of glasses of this, and nothing else.
When I got on the coach the driver had not taken his seat, and I saw him
talking with the landlady. They were evidently talking of me, for every
now and then they looked at me, and some of the people who were sitting
on the bench outside the door—which they call by a name meaning
“word-bearer”—came and listened, and then looked at me, most of them
pityingly. I could hear a lot of words often repeated, queer words, for
there were many nationalities in the crowd; so I quietly got my polyglot
dictionary from my bag and looked them out. I must say they were not
cheering to me, for amongst them were “Ordog”—Satan, “pokol”—hell,
“stregoica”—witch, “vrolok” and “vlkoslak”—both of which mean the same
thing, one being Slovak and the other Servian for something that is
either were-wolf or vampire. (Mem., I must ask the Count about these
superstitions)
When we started, the crowd round the inn door, which had by this time
swelled to a considerable size, all made the sign of the cross and
pointed two fingers towards me. With some difficulty I got a
fellow-passenger to tell me what they meant; he would not answer at
first, but on learning that I was English, he explained that it was a
charm or guard against the evil eye. This was not very pleasant for me,
just starting for an unknown place to meet an unknown man; but every one
seemed so kind-hearted, and so sorrowful, and so sympathetic that I
could not but be touched. I shall never forget the last glimpse which I
had of the inn-yard and its crowd of picturesque figures, all crossing
themselves, as they stood round the wide archway, with its background of
rich foliage of oleander and orange trees in green tubs clustered in the
centre of the yard. Then our driver, whose wide linen drawers covered
the whole front of the box-seat—“gotza” they call them—cracked his big
whip over his four small horses, which ran abreast, and we set off on
our journey.
I soon lost sight and recollection of ghostly fears in the beauty of the
scene as we drove along, although had I known the language, or rather
languages, which my fellow-passengers were speaking, I might not have
been able to throw them off so easily. Before us lay a green sloping
land full of forests and woods, with here and there steep hills, crowned
with clumps of trees or with farmhouses, the blank gable end to the
road. There was everywhere a bewildering mass of fruit blossom—apple,
plum, pear, cherry; and as we drove by I could see the green grass under
the trees spangled with the fallen petals. In and out amongst these
green hills of what they call here the “Mittel Land” ran the road,
losing itself as it swept round the grassy curve, or was shut out by the
straggling ends of pine woods, which here and there ran down the
hillsides like tongues of flame. The road was rugged, but still we
seemed to fly over it with a feverish haste. I could not understand then
what the haste meant, but the driver was evidently bent on losing no
time in reaching Borgo Prund. I was told that this road is in summertime
excellent, but that it had not yet been put in order after the winter
snows. In this respect it is different from the general run of roads in
the Carpathians, for it is an old tradition that they are not to be kept
in too good order. Of old the Hospadars would not repair them, lest the
Turk should think that they were preparing to bring in foreign troops,
and so hasten the war which was always really at loading point.
Beyond the green swelling hills of the Mittel Land rose mighty slopes
of forest up to the lofty steeps of the Carpathians themselves. Right
and left of us they towered, with the afternoon sun falling full upon
them and bringing out all the glorious colours of this beautiful range,
deep blue and purple in the shadows of the peaks, green and brown where
grass and rock mingled, and an endless perspective of jagged rock and
pointed crags, till these were themselves lost in the distance, where
the snowy peaks rose grandly. Here and there seemed mighty rifts in the
mountains, through which, as the sun began to sink, we saw now and again
the white gleam of falling water. One of my companions touched my arm as
we swept round the base of a hill and opened up the lofty, snow-covered
peak of a mountain, which seemed, as we wound on our serpentine way, to
be right before us:—
“Look! Isten szek!”—“God’s seat!”—and he crossed himself reverently.
As we wound on our endless way, and the sun sank lower and lower behind
us, the shadows of the evening began to creep round us. This was
emphasised by the fact that the snowy mountain-top still held the
sunset, and seemed to glow out with a delicate cool pink. Here and there
we passed Cszeks and Slovaks, all in picturesque attire, but I noticed
that goitre was painfully prevalent. By the roadside were many crosses,
and as we swept by, my companions all crossed themselves. Here and there
was a peasant man or woman kneeling before a shrine, who did not even
turn round as we approached, but seemed in the self-surrender of
devotion to have neither eyes nor ears for the outer world. There were
many things new to me: for instance, hay-ricks in the trees, and here
and there very beautiful masses of weeping birch, their white stems
shining like silver through the delicate green of the leaves. Now and
again we passed a leiter-wagon—the ordinary peasant’s cart—with its
long, snake-like vertebra, calculated to suit the inequalities of the
road. On this were sure to be seated quite a group of home-coming
peasants, the Cszeks with their white, and the Slovaks with their
coloured, sheepskins, the latter carrying lance-fashion their long
staves, with axe at end. As the evening fell it began to get very cold,
and the growing twilight seemed to merge into one dark mistiness the
gloom of the trees, oak, beech, and pine, though in the valleys which
ran deep between the spurs of the hills, as we ascended through the
Pass, the dark firs stood out here and there against the background of
late-lying snow. Sometimes, as the road was cut through the pine woods
that seemed in the darkness to be closing down upon us, great masses of
greyness, which here and there bestrewed the trees, produced a
peculiarly weird and solemn effect, which carried on the thoughts and
grim fancies engendered earlier in the evening, when the falling sunset
threw into strange relief the ghost-like clouds which amongst the
Carpathians seem to wind ceaselessly through the valleys. Sometimes the
hills were so steep that, despite our driver’s haste, the horses could
only go slowly. I wished to get down and walk up them, as we do at home,
but the driver would not hear of it. “No, no,” he said; “you must not
walk here; the dogs are too fierce”; and then he added, with what he
evidently meant for grim pleasantry—for he looked round to catch the
approving smile of the rest—“and you may have enough of such matters
before you go to sleep.” The only stop he would make was a moment’s
pause to light his lamps.
When it grew dark there seemed to be some excitement amongst the
passengers, and they kept speaking to him, one after the other, as
though urging him to further speed. He lashed the horses unmercifully
with his long whip, and with wild cries of encouragement urged them on
to further exertions. Then through the darkness I could see a sort of
patch of grey light ahead of us, as though there were a cleft in the
hills. The excitement of the passengers grew greater; the crazy coach
rocked on its great leather springs, and swayed like a boat tossed on a
stormy sea. I had to hold on. The road grew more level, and we appeared
to fly along. Then the mountains seemed to come nearer to us on each
side and to frown down upon us; we were entering on the Borgo Pass. One
by one several of the passengers offered me gifts, which they pressed
upon me with an earnestness which would take no denial; these were
certainly of an odd and varied kind, but each was given in simple good
faith, with a kindly word, and a blessing, and that strange mixture of
fear-meaning movements which I had seen outside the hotel at
Bistritz—the sign of the cross and the guard against the evil eye.
Then, as we flew along, the driver leaned forward, and on each side the
passengers, craning over the edge of the coach, peered eagerly into the
darkness. It was evident that something very exciting was either
happening or expected, but though I asked each passenger, no one would
give me the slightest explanation. This state of excitement kept on for
some little time; and at last we saw before us the Pass opening out on
the eastern side. There were dark, rolling clouds overhead, and in the
air the heavy, oppressive sense of thunder. It seemed as though the
mountain range had separated two atmospheres, and that now we had got
into the thunderous one. I was now myself looking out for the conveyance
which was to take me to the Count. Each moment I expected to see the
glare of lamps through the blackness; but all was dark. The only light
was the flickering rays of our own lamps, in which the steam from our
hard-driven horses rose in a white cloud. We could see now the sandy
road lying white before us, but there was on it no sign of a vehicle.
The passengers drew back with a sigh of gladness, which seemed to mock
my own disappointment. I was already thinking what I had best do, when
the driver, looking at his watch, said to the others something which I
could hardly hear, it was spoken so quietly and in so low a tone; I
thought it was “An hour less than the time.” Then turning to me, he said
in German worse than my own:—
“There is no carriage here. The Herr is not expected after all. He will
now come on to Bukovina, and return to-morrow or the next day; better
the next day.” Whilst he was speaking the horses began to neigh and
snort and plunge wildly, so that the driver had to hold them up. Then,
amongst a chorus of screams from the peasants and a universal crossing
of themselves, a calèche, with four horses, drove up behind us, overtook
us, and drew up beside the coach. I could see from the flash of our
lamps, as the rays fell on them, that the horses were coal-black and
splendid animals. They were driven by a tall man, with a long brown
beard and a great black hat, which seemed to hide his face from us. I
could only see the gleam of a pair of very bright eyes, which seemed red
in the lamplight, as he turned to us. He said to the driver:—
“You are early to-night, my friend.” The man stammered in reply:—
“The English Herr was in a hurry,” to which the stranger replied:—
“That is why, I suppose, you wished him to go on to Bukovina. You cannot
deceive me, my friend; I know too much, and my horses are swift.” As he
spoke he smiled, and the lamplight fell on a hard-looking mouth, with
very red lips and sharp-looking teeth, as white as ivory. One of my
companions whispered to another the line from Burger’s “Lenore”:—
The strange driver evidently heard the words, for he looked up with a
gleaming smile. The passenger turned his face away, at the same time
putting out his two fingers and crossing himself. “Give me the Herr’s
luggage,” said the driver; and with exceeding alacrity my bags were
handed out and put in the calèche. Then I descended from the side of the
coach, as the calèche was close alongside, the driver helping me with a
hand which caught my arm in a grip of steel; his strength must have been
prodigious. Without a word he shook his reins, the horses turned, and we
swept into the darkness of the Pass. As I looked back I saw the steam
from the horses of the coach by the light of the lamps, and projected
against it the figures of my late companions crossing themselves. Then
the driver cracked his whip and called to his horses, and off they swept
on their way to Bukovina. As they sank into the darkness I felt a
strange chill, and a lonely feeling came over me; but a cloak was thrown
over my shoulders, and a rug across my knees, and the driver said in
excellent German:—
“The night is chill, mein Herr, and my master the Count bade me take all
care of you. There is a flask of slivovitz (the plum brandy of the
country) underneath the seat, if you should require it.” I did not take
any, but it was a comfort to know it was there all the same. I felt a
little strangely, and not a little frightened. I think had there been
any alternative I should have taken it, instead of prosecuting that
unknown night journey. The carriage went at a hard pace straight along,
then we made a complete turn and went along another straight road. It
seemed to me that we were simply going over and over the same ground
again; and so I took note of some salient point, and found that this was
so. I would have liked to have asked the driver what this all meant, but
I really feared to do so, for I thought that, placed as I was, any
protest would have had no effect in case there had been an intention to
delay. By-and-by, however, as I was curious to know how time was
passing, I struck a match, and by its flame looked at my watch; it was
within a few minutes of midnight. This gave me a sort of shock, for I
suppose the general superstition about midnight was increased by my
recent experiences. I waited with a sick feeling of suspense.
Then a dog began to howl somewhere in a farmhouse far down the road—a
long, agonised wailing, as if from fear. The sound was taken up by
another dog, and then another and another, till, borne on the wind which
now sighed softly through the Pass, a wild howling began, which seemed
to come from all over the country, as far as the imagination could grasp
it through the gloom of the night. At the first howl the horses began to
strain and rear, but the driver spoke to them soothingly, and they
quieted down, but shivered and sweated as though after a runaway from
sudden fright. Then, far off in the distance, from the mountains on each
side of us began a louder and a sharper howling—that of wolves—which
affected both the horses and myself in the same way—for I was minded to
jump from the calèche and run, whilst they reared again and plunged
madly, so that the driver had to use all his great strength to keep them
from bolting. In a few minutes, however, my own ears got accustomed to
the sound, and the horses so far became quiet that the driver was able
to descend and to stand before them. He petted and soothed them, and
whispered something in their ears, as I have heard of horse-tamers
doing, and with extraordinary effect, for under his caresses they became
quite manageable again, though they still trembled. The driver again
took his seat, and shaking his reins, started off at a great pace. This
time, after going to the far side of the Pass, he suddenly turned down a
narrow roadway which ran sharply to the right.
Soon we were hemmed in with trees, which in places arched right over the
roadway till we passed as through a tunnel; and again great frowning
rocks guarded us boldly on either side. Though we were in shelter, we
could hear the rising wind, for it moaned and whistled through the
rocks, and the branches of the trees crashed together as we swept along.
It grew colder and colder still, and fine, powdery snow began to fall,
so that soon we and all around us were covered with a white blanket. The
keen wind still carried the howling of the dogs, though this grew
fainter as we went on our way. The baying of the wolves sounded nearer
and nearer, as though they were closing round on us from every side. I
grew dreadfully afraid, and the horses shared my fear. The driver,
however, was not in the least disturbed; he kept turning his head to
left and right, but I could not see anything through the darkness.
Suddenly, away on our left, I saw a faint flickering blue flame. The
driver saw it at the same moment; he at once checked the horses, and,
jumping to the ground, disappeared into the darkness. I did not know
what to do, the less as the howling of the wolves grew closer; but while
I wondered the driver suddenly appeared again, and without a word took
his seat, and we resumed our journey. I think I must have fallen asleep
and kept dreaming of the incident, for it seemed to be repeated
endlessly, and now looking back, it is like a sort of awful nightmare.
Once the flame appeared so near the road, that even in the darkness
around us I could watch the driver’s motions. He went rapidly to where
the blue flame arose—it must have been very faint, for it did not seem
to illumine the place around it at all—and gathering a few stones,
formed them into some device. Once there appeared a strange optical
effect: when he stood between me and the flame he did not obstruct it,
for I could see its ghostly flicker all the same. This startled me, but
as the effect was only momentary, I took it that my eyes deceived me
straining through the darkness. Then for a time there were no blue
flames, and we sped onwards through the gloom, with the howling of the
wolves around us, as though they were following in a moving circle.
At last there came a time when the driver went further afield than he
had yet gone, and during his absence, the horses began to tremble worse
than ever and to snort and scream with fright. I could not see any cause
for it, for the howling of the wolves had ceased altogether; but just
then the moon, sailing through the black clouds, appeared behind the
jagged crest of a beetling, pine-clad rock, and by its light I saw
around us a ring of wolves, with white teeth and lolling red tongues,
with long, sinewy limbs and shaggy hair. They were a hundred times more
terrible in the grim silence which held them than even when they howled.
For myself, I felt a sort of paralysis of fear. It is only when a man
feels himself face to face with such horrors that he can understand
their true import.
All at once the wolves began to howl as though the moonlight had had
some peculiar effect on them. The horses jumped about and reared, and
looked helplessly round with eyes that rolled in a way painful to see;
but the living ring of terror encompassed them on every side; and they
had perforce to remain within it. I called to the coachman to come, for
it seemed to me that our only chance was to try to break out through the
ring and to aid his approach. I shouted and beat the side of the
calèche, hoping by the noise to scare the wolves from that side, so as
to give him a chance of reaching the trap. How he came there, I know
not, but I heard his voice raised in a tone of imperious command, and
looking towards the sound, saw him stand in the roadway. As he swept his
long arms, as though brushing aside some impalpable obstacle, the wolves
fell back and back further still. Just then a heavy cloud passed across
the face of the moon, so that we were again in darkness.
When I could see again the driver was climbing into the calèche, and the
wolves had disappeared. This was all so strange and uncanny that a
dreadful fear came upon me, and I was afraid to speak or move. The time
seemed interminable as we swept on our way, now in almost complete
darkness, for the rolling clouds obscured the moon. We kept on
ascending, with occasional periods of quick descent, but in the main
always ascending. Suddenly, I became conscious of the fact that the
driver was in the act of pulling up the horses in the courtyard of a
vast ruined castle, from whose tall black windows came no ray of light,
and whose broken battlements showed a jagged line against the moonlit
sky.
5 May.—I must have been asleep, for certainly if I had been fully
awake I must have noticed the approach of such a remarkable place. In
the gloom the courtyard looked of considerable size, and as several dark
ways led from it under great round arches, it perhaps seemed bigger than
it really is. I have not yet been able to see it by daylight.
When the calèche stopped, the driver jumped down and held out his hand
to assist me to alight. Again I could not but notice his prodigious
strength. His hand actually seemed like a steel vice that could have
crushed mine if he had chosen. Then he took out my traps, and placed
them on the ground beside me as I stood close to a great door, old and
studded with large iron nails, and set in a projecting doorway of
massive stone. I could see even in the dim light that the stone was
massively carved, but that the carving had been much worn by time and
weather. As I stood, the driver jumped again into his seat and shook the
reins; the horses started forward, and trap and all disappeared down one
of the dark openings.
I stood in silence where I was, for I did not know what to do. Of bell
or knocker there was no sign; through these frowning walls and dark
window openings it was not likely that my voice could penetrate. The
time I waited seemed endless, and I felt doubts and fears crowding upon
me. What sort of place had I come to, and among what kind of people?
What sort of grim adventure was it on which I had embarked? Was this a
customary incident in the life of a solicitor’s clerk sent out to
explain the purchase of a London estate to a foreigner? Solicitor’s
clerk! Mina would not like that. Solicitor—for just before leaving
London I got word that my examination was successful; and I am now a
full-blown solicitor! I began to rub my eyes and pinch myself to see if
I were awake. It all seemed like a horrible nightmare to me, and I
expected that I should suddenly awake, and find myself at home, with
the dawn struggling in through the windows, as I had now and again felt
in the morning after a day of overwork. But my flesh answered the
pinching test, and my eyes were not to be deceived. I was indeed awake
and among the Carpathians. All I could do now was to be patient, and to
wait the coming of the morning.
Just as I had come to this conclusion I heard a heavy step approaching
behind the great door, and saw through the chinks the gleam of a coming
light. Then there was the sound of rattling chains and the clanking of
massive bolts drawn back. A key was turned with the loud grating noise
of long disuse, and the great door swung back.
Within, stood a tall old man, clean shaven save for a long white
moustache, and clad in black from head to foot, without a single speck
of colour about him anywhere. He held in his hand an antique silver
lamp, in which the flame burned without chimney or globe of any kind,
throwing long quivering shadows as it flickered in the draught of the
open door. The old man motioned me in with his right hand with a courtly
gesture, saying in excellent English, but with a strange intonation:—
“Welcome to my house! Enter freely and of your own will!” He made no
motion of stepping to meet me, but stood like a statue, as though his
gesture of welcome had fixed him into stone. The instant, however, that
I had stepped over the threshold, he moved impulsively forward, and
holding out his hand grasped mine with a strength which made me wince,
an effect which was not lessened by the fact that it seemed as cold as
ice—more like the hand of a dead than a living man. Again he said:—
“Welcome to my house. Come freely. Go safely; and leave something of the
happiness you bring!” The strength of the handshake was so much akin to
that which I had noticed in the driver, whose face I had not seen, that
for a moment I doubted if it were not the same person to whom I was
speaking; so to make sure, I said interrogatively:—
“Count Dracula?” He bowed in a courtly way as he replied:—
“I am Dracula; and I bid you welcome, Mr. Harker, to my house. Come in;
the night air is chill, and you must need to eat and rest.” As he was
speaking, he put the lamp on a bracket on the wall, and stepping out,
took my luggage; he had carried it in before I could forestall him. I
protested but he insisted:—
“Nay, sir, you are my guest. It is late, and my people are not
available. Let me see to your comfort myself.” He insisted on carrying
my traps along the passage, and then up a great winding stair, and
along another great passage, on whose stone floor our steps rang
heavily. At the end of this he threw open a heavy door, and I rejoiced
to see within a well-lit room in which a table was spread for supper,
and on whose mighty hearth a great fire of logs, freshly replenished,
flamed and flared.
The Count halted, putting down my bags, closed the door, and crossing
the room, opened another door, which led into a small octagonal room lit
by a single lamp, and seemingly without a window of any sort. Passing
through this, he opened another door, and motioned me to enter. It was a
welcome sight; for here was a great bedroom well lighted and warmed with
another log fire,—also added to but lately, for the top logs were
fresh—which sent a hollow roar up the wide chimney. The Count himself
left my luggage inside and withdrew, saying, before he closed the
door:—
“You will need, after your journey, to refresh yourself by making your
toilet. I trust you will find all you wish. When you are ready, come
into the other room, where you will find your supper prepared.”
The light and warmth and the Count’s courteous welcome seemed to have
dissipated all my doubts and fears. Having then reached my normal state,
I discovered that I was half famished with hunger; so making a hasty
toilet, I went into the other room.
I found supper already laid out. My host, who stood on one side of the
great fireplace, leaning against the stonework, made a graceful wave of
his hand to the table, and said:—
“I pray you, be seated and sup how you please. You will, I trust, excuse
me that I do not join you; but I have dined already, and I do not sup.”
I handed to him the sealed letter which Mr. Hawkins had entrusted to me.
He opened it and read it gravely; then, with a charming smile, he handed
it to me to read. One passage of it, at least, gave me a thrill of
pleasure.
“I must regret that an attack of gout, from which malady I am a constant
sufferer, forbids absolutely any travelling on my part for some time to
come; but I am happy to say I can send a sufficient substitute, one in
whom I have every possible confidence. He is a young man, full of energy
and talent in his own way, and of a very faithful disposition. He is
discreet and silent, and has grown into manhood in my service. He shall
be ready to attend on you when you will during his stay, and shall take
your instructions in all matters.”
The Count himself came forward and took off the cover of a dish, and I
fell to at once on an excellent roast chicken. This, with some cheese
and a salad and a bottle of old Tokay, of which I had two glasses, was
my supper. During the time I was eating it the Count asked me many
questions as to my journey, and I told him by degrees all I had
experienced.
By this time I had finished my supper, and by my host’s desire had drawn
up a chair by the fire and begun to smoke a cigar which he offered me,
at the same time excusing himself that he did not smoke. I had now an
opportunity of observing him, and found him of a very marked
physiognomy.
His face was a strong—a very strong—aquiline, with high bridge of the
thin nose and peculiarly arched nostrils; with lofty domed forehead, and
hair growing scantily round the temples but profusely elsewhere. His
eyebrows were very massive, almost meeting over the nose, and with bushy
hair that seemed to curl in its own profusion. The mouth, so far as I
could see it under the heavy moustache, was fixed and rather
cruel-looking, with peculiarly sharp white teeth; these protruded over
the lips, whose remarkable ruddiness showed astonishing vitality in a
man of his years. For the rest, his ears were pale, and at the tops
extremely pointed; the chin was broad and strong, and the cheeks firm
though thin. The general effect was one of extraordinary pallor.
Hitherto I had noticed the backs of his hands as they lay on his knees
in the firelight, and they had seemed rather white and fine; but seeing
them now close to me, I could not but notice that they were rather
coarse—broad, with squat fingers. Strange to say, there were hairs in
the centre of the palm. The nails were long and fine, and cut to a sharp
point. As the Count leaned over me and his hands touched me, I could not
repress a shudder. It may have been that his breath was rank, but a
horrible feeling of nausea came over me, which, do what I would, I could
not conceal. The Count, evidently noticing it, drew back; and with a
grim sort of smile, which showed more than he had yet done his
protuberant teeth, sat himself down again on his own side of the
fireplace. We were both silent for a while; and as I looked towards the
window I saw the first dim streak of the coming dawn. There seemed a
strange stillness over everything; but as I listened I heard as if from
down below in the valley the howling of many wolves. The Count’s eyes
gleamed, and he said:—
“Listen to them—the children of the night. What music they make!”
Seeing, I suppose, some expression in my face strange to him, he
added:—
“Ah, sir, you dwellers in the city cannot enter into the feelings of the
hunter.” Then he rose and said:—
“But you must be tired. Your bedroom is all ready, and to-morrow you
shall sleep as late as you will. I have to be away till the afternoon;
so sleep well and dream well!” With a courteous bow, he opened for me
himself the door to the octagonal room, and I entered my bedroom....
I am all in a sea of wonders. I doubt; I fear; I think strange things,
which I dare not confess to my own soul. God keep me, if only for the
sake of those dear to me!

7 May.—It is again early morning, but I have rested and enjoyed the
last twenty-four hours. I slept till late in the day, and awoke of my
own accord. When I had dressed myself I went into the room where we had
supped, and found a cold breakfast laid out, with coffee kept hot by the
pot being placed on the hearth. There was a card on the table, on which
was written:—
“I have to be absent for a while. Do not wait for me.—D.” I set to and
enjoyed a hearty meal. When I had done, I looked for a bell, so that I
might let the servants know I had finished; but I could not find one.
There are certainly odd deficiencies in the house, considering the
extraordinary evidences of wealth which are round me. The table service
is of gold, and so beautifully wrought that it must be of immense value.
The curtains and upholstery of the chairs and sofas and the hangings of
my bed are of the costliest and most beautiful fabrics, and must have
been of fabulous value when they were made, for they are centuries old,
though in excellent order. I saw something like them in Hampton Court,
but there they were worn and frayed and moth-eaten. But still in none of
the rooms is there a mirror. There is not even a toilet glass on my
table, and I had to get the little shaving glass from my bag before I
could either shave or brush my hair. I have not yet seen a servant
anywhere, or heard a sound near the castle except the howling of wolves.
Some time after I had finished my meal—I do not know whether to call it
breakfast or dinner, for it was between five and six o’clock when I had
it—I looked about for something to read, for I did not like to go about
the castle until I had asked the Count’s permission. There was
absolutely nothing in the room, book, newspaper, or even writing
materials; so I opened another door in the room and found a sort of
library. The door opposite mine I tried, but found it locked.
In the library I found, to my great delight, a vast number of English
books, whole shelves full of them, and bound volumes of magazines and
newspapers. A table in the centre was littered with English magazines
and newspapers, though none of them were of very recent date. The books
were of the most varied kind—history, geography, politics, political
economy, botany, geology, law—all relating to England and English life
and customs and manners. There were even such books of reference as the
London Directory, the “Red” and “Blue” books, Whitaker’s Almanac, the
Army and Navy Lists, and—it somehow gladdened my heart to see it—the
Law List.
Whilst I was looking at the books, the door opened, and the Count
entered. He saluted me in a hearty way, and hoped that I had had a good
night’s rest. Then he went on:—
“I am glad you found your way in here, for I am sure there is much that
will interest you. These companions”—and he laid his hand on some of
the books—“have been good friends to me, and for some years past, ever
since I had the idea of going to London, have given me many, many hours
of pleasure. Through them I have come to know your great England; and to
know her is to love her. I long to go through the crowded streets of
your mighty London, to be in the midst of the whirl and rush of
humanity, to share its life, its change, its death, and all that makes
it what it is. But alas! as yet I only know your tongue through books.
To you, my friend, I look that I know it to speak.”
“But, Count,” I said, “you know and speak English thoroughly!” He bowed
gravely.
“I thank you, my friend, for your all too-flattering estimate, but yet I
fear that I am but a little way on the road I would travel. True, I know
the grammar and the words, but yet I know not how to speak them.”
“Indeed,” I said, “you speak excellently.”
“Not so,” he answered. “Well, I know that, did I move and speak in your
London, none there are who would not know me for a stranger. That is not
enough for me. Here I am noble; I am boyar; the common people know me,
and I am master. But a stranger in a strange land, he is no one; men
know him not—and to know not is to care not for. I am content if I am
like the rest, so that no man stops if he see me, or pause in his
speaking if he hear my words, ‘Ha, ha! a stranger!’ I have been so long
master that I would be master still—or at least that none other should
be master of me. You come to me not alone as agent of my friend Peter
Hawkins, of Exeter, to tell me all about my new estate in London. You
shall, I trust, rest here with me awhile, so that by our talking I may
learn the English intonation; and I would that you tell me when I make
error, even of the smallest, in my speaking. I am sorry that I had to be
away so long to-day; but you will, I know, forgive one who has so many
important affairs in hand.”
Of course I said all I could about being willing, and asked if I might
come into that room when I chose. He answered: “Yes, certainly,” and
added:—
“You may go anywhere you wish in the castle, except where the doors are
locked, where of course you will not wish to go. There is reason that
all things are as they are, and did you see with my eyes and know with
my knowledge, you would perhaps better understand.” I said I was sure of
this, and then he went on:—
“We are in Transylvania; and Transylvania is not England. Our ways are
not your ways, and there shall be to you many strange things. Nay, from
what you have told me of your experiences already, you know something of
what strange things there may be.”
This led to much conversation; and as it was evident that he wanted to
talk, if only for talking’s sake, I asked him many questions regarding
things that had already happened to me or come within my notice.
Sometimes he sheered off the subject, or turned the conversation by
pretending not to understand; but generally he answered all I asked most
frankly. Then as time went on, and I had got somewhat bolder, I asked
him of some of the strange things of the preceding night, as, for
instance, why the coachman went to the places where he had seen the blue
flames. He then explained to me that it was commonly believed that on a
certain night of the year—last night, in fact, when all evil spirits
are supposed to have unchecked sway—a blue flame is seen over any place
where treasure has been concealed. “That treasure has been hidden,” he
went on, “in the region through which you came last night, there can be
but little doubt; for it was the ground fought over for centuries by the
Wallachian, the Saxon, and the Turk. Why, there is hardly a foot of soil
in all this region that has not been enriched by the blood of men,
patriots or invaders. In old days there were stirring times, when the
Austrian and the Hungarian came up in hordes, and the patriots went out
to meet them—men and women, the aged and the children too—and waited
their coming on the rocks above the passes, that they might sweep
destruction on them with their artificial avalanches. When the invader
was triumphant he found but little, for whatever there was had been
sheltered in the friendly soil.”
“But how,” said I, “can it have remained so long undiscovered, when
there is a sure index to it if men will but take the trouble to look?”
The Count smiled, and as his lips ran back over his gums, the long,
sharp, canine teeth showed out strangely; he answered:—
“Because your peasant is at heart a coward and a fool! Those flames only
appear on one night; and on that night no man of this land will, if he
can help it, stir without his doors. And, dear sir, even if he did he
would not know what to do. Why, even the peasant that you tell me of who
marked the place of the flame would not know where to look in daylight
even for his own work. Even you would not, I dare be sworn, be able to
find these places again?”
“There you are right,” I said. “I know no more than the dead where even
to look for them.” Then we drifted into other matters.
“Come,” he said at last, “tell me of London and of the house which you
have procured for me.” With an apology for my remissness, I went into my
own room to get the papers from my bag. Whilst I was placing them in
order I heard a rattling of china and silver in the next room, and as I
passed through, noticed that the table had been cleared and the lamp
lit, for it was by this time deep into the dark. The lamps were also lit
in the study or library, and I found the Count lying on the sofa,
reading, of all things in the world, an English Bradshaw’s Guide. When I
came in he cleared the books and papers from the table; and with him I
went into plans and deeds and figures of all sorts. He was interested in
everything, and asked me a myriad questions about the place and its
surroundings. He clearly had studied beforehand all he could get on the
subject of the neighbourhood, for he evidently at the end knew very much
more than I did. When I remarked this, he answered:—
“Well, but, my friend, is it not needful that I should? When I go there
I shall be all alone, and my friend Harker Jonathan—nay, pardon me, I
fall into my country’s habit of putting your patronymic first—my friend
Jonathan Harker will not be by my side to correct and aid me. He will be
in Exeter, miles away, probably working at papers of the law with my
other friend, Peter Hawkins. So!”
We went thoroughly into the business of the purchase of the estate at
Purfleet. When I had told him the facts and got his signature to the
necessary papers, and had written a letter with them ready to post to
Mr. Hawkins, he began to ask me how I had come across so suitable a
place. I read to him the notes which I had made at the time, and which I
inscribe here:—
“At Purfleet, on a by-road, I came across just such a place as seemed to
be required, and where was displayed a dilapidated notice that the place
was for sale. It is surrounded by a high wall, of ancient structure,
built of heavy stones, and has not been repaired for a large number of
years. The closed gates are of heavy old oak and iron, all eaten with
rust.
“The estate is called Carfax, no doubt a corruption of the old Quatre
Face, as the house is four-sided, agreeing with the cardinal points of
the compass. It contains in all some twenty acres, quite surrounded by
the solid stone wall above mentioned. There are many trees on it, which
make it in places gloomy, and there is a deep, dark-looking pond or
small lake, evidently fed by some springs, as the water is clear and
flows away in a fair-sized stream. The house is very large and of all
periods back, I should say, to mediæval times, for one part is of stone
immensely thick, with only a few windows high up and heavily barred with
iron. It looks like part of a keep, and is close to an old chapel or
church. I could not enter it, as I had not the key of the door leading
to it from the house, but I have taken with my kodak views of it from
various points. The house has been added to, but in a very straggling
way, and I can only guess at the amount of ground it covers, which must
be very great. There are but few houses close at hand, one being a very
large house only recently added to and formed into a private lunatic
asylum. It is not, however, visible from the grounds.”
When I had finished, he said:—
“I am glad that it is old and big. I myself am of an old family, and to
live in a new house would kill me. A house cannot be made habitable in a
day; and, after all, how few days go to make up a century. I rejoice
also that there is a chapel of old times. We Transylvanian nobles love
not to think that our bones may lie amongst the common dead. I seek not
gaiety nor mirth, not the bright voluptuousness of much sunshine and
sparkling waters which please the young and gay. I am no longer young;
and my heart, through weary years of mourning over the dead, is not
attuned to mirth. Moreover, the walls of my castle are broken; the
shadows are many, and the wind breathes cold through the broken
battlements and casements. I love the shade and the shadow, and would
be alone with my thoughts when I may.” Somehow his words and his look
did not seem to accord, or else it was that his cast of face made his
smile look malignant and saturnine.
Presently, with an excuse, he left me, asking me to put all my papers
together. He was some little time away, and I began to look at some of
the books around me. One was an atlas, which I found opened naturally at
England, as if that map had been much used. On looking at it I found in
certain places little rings marked, and on examining these I noticed
that one was near London on the east side, manifestly where his new
estate was situated; the other two were Exeter, and Whitby on the
Yorkshire coast.
It was the better part of an hour when the Count returned. “Aha!” he
said; “still at your books? Good! But you must not work always. Come; I
am informed that your supper is ready.” He took my arm, and we went into
the next room, where I found an excellent supper ready on the table. The
Count again excused himself, as he had dined out on his being away from
home. But he sat as on the previous night, and chatted whilst I ate.
After supper I smoked, as on the last evening, and the Count stayed with
me, chatting and asking questions on every conceivable subject, hour
after hour. I felt that it was getting very late indeed, but I did not
say anything, for I felt under obligation to meet my host’s wishes in
every way. I was not sleepy, as the long sleep yesterday had fortified
me; but I could not help experiencing that chill which comes over one at
the coming of the dawn, which is like, in its way, the turn of the tide.
They say that people who are near death die generally at the change to
the dawn or at the turn of the tide; any one who has when tired, and
tied as it were to his post, experienced this change in the atmosphere
can well believe it. All at once we heard the crow of a cock coming up
with preternatural shrillness through the clear morning air; Count
Dracula, jumping to his feet, said:—
“Why, there is the morning again! How remiss I am to let you stay up so
long. You must make your conversation regarding my dear new country of
England less interesting, so that I may not forget how time flies by
us,” and, with a courtly bow, he quickly left me.
I went into my own room and drew the curtains, but there was little to
notice; my window opened into the courtyard, all I could see was the
warm grey of quickening sky. So I pulled the curtains again, and have
written of this day.

8 May.—I began to fear as I wrote in this book that I was getting too
diffuse; but now I am glad that I went into detail from the first, for
there is something so strange about this place and all in it that I
cannot but feel uneasy. I wish I were safe out of it, or that I had
never come. It may be that this strange night-existence is telling on
me; but would that that were all! If there were any one to talk to I
could bear it, but there is no one. I have only the Count to speak with,
and he!—I fear I am myself the only living soul within the place. Let
me be prosaic so far as facts can be; it will help me to bear up, and
imagination must not run riot with me. If it does I am lost. Let me say
at once how I stand—or seem to.
I only slept a few hours when I went to bed, and feeling that I could
not sleep any more, got up. I had hung my shaving glass by the window,
and was just beginning to shave. Suddenly I felt a hand on my shoulder,
and heard the Count’s voice saying to me, “Good-morning.” I started, for
it amazed me that I had not seen him, since the reflection of the glass
covered the whole room behind me. In starting I had cut myself slightly,
but did not notice it at the moment. Having answered the Count’s
salutation, I turned to the glass again to see how I had been mistaken.
This time there could be no error, for the man was close to me, and I
could see him over my shoulder. But there was no reflection of him in
the mirror! The whole room behind me was displayed; but there was no
sign of a man in it, except myself. This was startling, and, coming on
the top of so many strange things, was beginning to increase that vague
feeling of uneasiness which I always have when the Count is near; but at
the instant I saw that the cut had bled a little, and the blood was
trickling over my chin. I laid down the razor, turning as I did so half
round to look for some sticking plaster. When the Count saw my face, his
eyes blazed with a sort of demoniac fury, and he suddenly made a grab at
my throat. I drew away, and his hand touched the string of beads which
held the crucifix. It made an instant change in him, for the fury passed
so quickly that I could hardly believe that it was ever there.
“Take care,” he said, “take care how you cut yourself. It is more
dangerous than you think in this country.” Then seizing the shaving
glass, he went on: “And this is the wretched thing that has done the
mischief. It is a foul bauble of man’s vanity. Away with it!” and
opening the heavy window with one wrench of his terrible hand, he flung
out the glass, which was shattered into a thousand pieces on the stones
of the courtyard far below. Then he withdrew without a word. It is very
annoying, for I do not see how I am to shave, unless in my watch-case or
the bottom of the shaving-pot, which is fortunately of metal.
When I went into the dining-room, breakfast was prepared; but I could
not find the Count anywhere. So I breakfasted alone. It is strange that
as yet I have not seen the Count eat or drink. He must be a very
peculiar man! After breakfast I did a little exploring in the castle. I
went out on the stairs, and found a room looking towards the South. The
view was magnificent, and from where I stood there was every opportunity
of seeing it. The castle is on the very edge of a terrible precipice. A
stone falling from the window would fall a thousand feet without
touching anything! As far as the eye can reach is a sea of green tree
tops, with occasionally a deep rift where there is a chasm. Here and
there are silver threads where the rivers wind in deep gorges through
the forests.
But I am not in heart to describe beauty, for when I had seen the view I
explored further; doors, doors, doors everywhere, and all locked and
bolted. In no place save from the windows in the castle walls is there
an available exit.
The castle is a veritable prison, and I am a prisoner!
WHEN I found that I was a prisoner a sort of wild feeling came over me.
I rushed up and down the stairs, trying every door and peering out of
every window I could find; but after a little the conviction of my
helplessness overpowered all other feelings. When I look back after a
few hours I think I must have been mad for the time, for I behaved much
as a rat does in a trap. When, however, the conviction had come to me
that I was helpless I sat down quietly—as quietly as I have ever done
anything in my life—and began to think over what was best to be done. I
am thinking still, and as yet have come to no definite conclusion. Of
one thing only am I certain; that it is no use making my ideas known to
the Count. He knows well that I am imprisoned; and as he has done it
himself, and has doubtless his own motives for it, he would only deceive
me if I trusted him fully with the facts. So far as I can see, my only
plan will be to keep my knowledge and my fears to myself, and my eyes
open. I am, I know, either being deceived, like a baby, by my own fears,
or else I am in desperate straits; and if the latter be so, I need, and
shall need, all my brains to get through.
I had hardly come to this conclusion when I heard the great door below
shut, and knew that the Count had returned. He did not come at once into
the library, so I went cautiously to my own room and found him making
the bed. This was odd, but only confirmed what I had all along
thought—that there were no servants in the house. When later I saw him
through the chink of the hinges of the door laying the table in the
dining-room, I was assured of it; for if he does himself all these
menial offices, surely it is proof that there is no one else to do them.
This gave me a fright, for if there is no one else in the castle, it
must have been the Count himself who was the driver of the coach that
brought me here. This is a terrible thought; for if so, what does it
mean that he could control the wolves, as he did, by only holding up his
hand in silence. How was it that all the people at Bistritz and on the
coach had some terrible fear for me? What meant the giving of the
crucifix, of the garlic, of the wild rose, of the mountain ash? Bless
that good, good woman who hung the crucifix round my neck! for it is a
comfort and a strength to me whenever I touch it. It is odd that a thing
which I have been taught to regard with disfavour and as idolatrous
should in a time of loneliness and trouble be of help. Is it that there
is something in the essence of the thing itself, or that it is a medium,
a tangible help, in conveying memories of sympathy and comfort? Some
time, if it may be, I must examine this matter and try to make up my
mind about it. In the meantime I must find out all I can about Count
Dracula, as it may help me to understand. To-night he may talk of
himself, if I turn the conversation that way. I must be very careful,
however, not to awake his suspicion.

Midnight.—I have had a long talk with the Count. I asked him a few
questions on Transylvania history, and he warmed up to the subject
wonderfully. In his speaking of things and people, and especially of
battles, he spoke as if he had been present at them all. This he
afterwards explained by saying that to a boyar the pride of his house
and name is his own pride, that their glory is his glory, that their
fate is his fate. Whenever he spoke of his house he always said “we,”
and spoke almost in the plural, like a king speaking. I wish I could put
down all he said exactly as he said it, for to me it was most
fascinating. It seemed to have in it a whole history of the country. He
grew excited as he spoke, and walked about the room pulling his great
white moustache and grasping anything on which he laid his hands as
though he would crush it by main strength. One thing he said which I
shall put down as nearly as I can; for it tells in its way the story of
his race:—
“We Szekelys have a right to be proud, for in our veins flows the blood
of many brave races who fought as the lion fights, for lordship. Here,
in the whirlpool of European races, the Ugric tribe bore down from
Iceland the fighting spirit which Thor and Wodin gave them, which their
Berserkers displayed to such fell intent on the seaboards of Europe, ay,
and of Asia and Africa too, till the peoples thought that the
were-wolves themselves had come. Here, too, when they came, they found
the Huns, whose warlike fury had swept the earth like a living flame,
till the dying peoples held that in their veins ran the blood of those
old witches, who, expelled from Scythia had mated with the devils in the
desert. Fools, fools! What devil or what witch was ever so great as
Attila, whose blood is in these veins?” He held up his arms. “Is it a
wonder that we were a conquering race; that we were proud; that when the
Magyar, the Lombard, the Avar, the Bulgar, or the Turk poured his
thousands on our frontiers, we drove them back? Is it strange that when
Arpad and his legions swept through the Hungarian fatherland he found us
here when he reached the frontier; that the Honfoglalas was completed
there? And when the Hungarian flood swept eastward, the Szekelys were
claimed as kindred by the victorious Magyars, and to us for centuries
was trusted the guarding of the frontier of Turkey-land; ay, and more
than that, endless duty of the frontier guard, for, as the Turks say,
‘water sleeps, and enemy is sleepless.’ Who more gladly than we
throughout the Four Nations received the ‘bloody sword,’ or at its
warlike call flocked quicker to the standard of the King? When was
redeemed that great shame of my nation, the shame of Cassova, when the
flags of the Wallach and the Magyar went down beneath the Crescent? Who
was it but one of my own race who as Voivode crossed the Danube and beat
the Turk on his own ground? This was a Dracula indeed! Woe was it that
his own unworthy brother, when he had fallen, sold his people to the
Turk and brought the shame of slavery on them! Was it not this Dracula,
indeed, who inspired that other of his race who in a later age again and
again brought his forces over the great river into Turkey-land; who,
when he was beaten back, came again, and again, and again, though he had
to come alone from the bloody field where his troops were being
slaughtered, since he knew that he alone could ultimately triumph! They
said that he thought only of himself. Bah! what good are peasants
without a leader? Where ends the war without a brain and heart to
conduct it? Again, when, after the battle of Mohács, we threw off the
Hungarian yoke, we of the Dracula blood were amongst their leaders, for
our spirit would not brook that we were not free. Ah, young sir, the
Szekelys—and the Dracula as their heart’s blood, their brains, and
their swords—can boast a record that mushroom growths like the
Hapsburgs and the Romanoffs can never reach. The warlike days are over.
Blood is too precious a thing in these days of dishonourable peace; and
the glories of the great races are as a tale that is told.”
It was by this time close on morning, and we went to bed. (Mem., this
diary seems horribly like the beginning of the “Arabian Nights,” for
everything has to break off at cockcrow—or like the ghost of Hamlet’s
father.)

12 May.—Let me begin with facts—bare, meagre facts, verified by
books and figures, and of which there can be no doubt. I must not
confuse them with experiences which will have to rest on my own
observation, or my memory of them. Last evening when the Count came from
his room he began by asking me questions on legal matters and on the
doing of certain kinds of business. I had spent the day wearily over
books, and, simply to keep my mind occupied, went over some of the
matters I had been examining at Lincoln’s Inn. There was a certain
method in the Count’s inquiries, so I shall try to put them down in
sequence; the knowledge may somehow or some time be useful to me.
First, he asked if a man in England might have two solicitors or more. I
told him he might have a dozen if he wished, but that it would not be
wise to have more than one solicitor engaged in one transaction, as only
one could act at a time, and that to change would be certain to militate
against his interest. He seemed thoroughly to understand, and went on to
ask if there would be any practical difficulty in having one man to
attend, say, to banking, and another to look after shipping, in case
local help were needed in a place far from the home of the banking
solicitor. I asked him to explain more fully, so that I might not by any
chance mislead him, so he said:—
“I shall illustrate. Your friend and mine, Mr. Peter Hawkins, from under
the shadow of your beautiful cathedral at Exeter, which is far from
London, buys for me through your good self my place at London. Good! Now
here let me say frankly, lest you should think it strange that I have
sought the services of one so far off from London instead of some one
resident there, that my motive was that no local interest might be
served save my wish only; and as one of London residence might, perhaps,
have some purpose of himself or friend to serve, I went thus afield to
seek my agent, whose labours should be only to my interest. Now, suppose
I, who have much of affairs, wish to ship goods, say, to Newcastle, or
Durham, or Harwich, or Dover, might it not be that it could with more
ease be done by consigning to one in these ports?” I answered that
certainly it would be most easy, but that we solicitors had a system of
agency one for the other, so that local work could be done locally on
instruction from any solicitor, so that the client, simply placing
himself in the hands of one man, could have his wishes carried out by
him without further trouble.
“But,” said he, “I could be at liberty to direct myself. Is it not so?”
“Of course,” I replied; and “such is often done by men of business, who
do not like the whole of their affairs to be known by any one person.”
“Good!” he said, and then went on to ask about the means of making
consignments and the forms to be gone through, and of all sorts of
difficulties which might arise, but by forethought could be guarded
against. I explained all these things to him to the best of my ability,
and he certainly left me under the impression that he would have made a
wonderful solicitor, for there was nothing that he did not think of or
foresee. For a man who was never in the country, and who did not
evidently do much in the way of business, his knowledge and acumen were
wonderful. When he had satisfied himself on these points of which he had
spoken, and I had verified all as well as I could by the books
available, he suddenly stood up and said:—
“Have you written since your first letter to our friend Mr. Peter
Hawkins, or to any other?” It was with some bitterness in my heart that
I answered that I had not, that as yet I had not seen any opportunity of
sending letters to anybody.
“Then write now, my young friend,” he said, laying a heavy hand on my
shoulder: “write to our friend and to any other; and say, if it will
please you, that you shall stay with me until a month from now.”
“Do you wish me to stay so long?” I asked, for my heart grew cold at the
thought.
“I desire it much; nay, I will take no refusal. When your master,
employer, what you will, engaged that someone should come on his behalf,
it was understood that my needs only were to be consulted. I have not
stinted. Is it not so?”
What could I do but bow acceptance? It was Mr. Hawkins’s interest, not
mine, and I had to think of him, not myself; and besides, while Count
Dracula was speaking, there was that in his eyes and in his bearing
which made me remember that I was a prisoner, and that if I wished it I
could have no choice. The Count saw his victory in my bow, and his
mastery in the trouble of my face, for he began at once to use them, but
in his own smooth, resistless way:—
“I pray you, my good young friend, that you will not discourse of things
other than business in your letters. It will doubtless please your
friends to know that you are well, and that you look forward to getting
home to them. Is it not so?” As he spoke he handed me three sheets of
note-paper and three envelopes. They were all of the thinnest foreign
post, and looking at them, then at him, and noticing his quiet smile,
with the sharp, canine teeth lying over the red underlip, I understood
as well as if he had spoken that I should be careful what I wrote, for
he would be able to read it. So I determined to write only formal notes
now, but to write fully to Mr. Hawkins in secret, and also to Mina, for
to her I could write in shorthand, which would puzzle the Count, if he
did see it. When I had written my two letters I sat quiet, reading a
book whilst the Count wrote several notes, referring as he wrote them to
some books on his table. Then he took up my two and placed them with his
own, and put by his writing materials, after which, the instant the door
had closed behind him, I leaned over and looked at the letters, which
were face down on the table. I felt no compunction in doing so, for
under the circumstances I felt that I should protect myself in every way
I could.
One of the letters was directed to Samuel F. Billington, No. 7, The
Crescent, Whitby, another to Herr Leutner, Varna; the third was to
Coutts & Co., London, and the fourth to Herren Klopstock & Billreuth,
bankers, Buda-Pesth. The second and fourth were unsealed. I was just
about to look at them when I saw the door-handle move. I sank back in my
seat, having just had time to replace the letters as they had been and
to resume my book before the Count, holding still another letter in his
hand, entered the room. He took up the letters on the table and stamped
them carefully, and then turning to me, said:—
“I trust you will forgive me, but I have much work to do in private this
evening. You will, I hope, find all things as you wish.” At the door he
turned, and after a moment’s pause said:—
“Let me advise you, my dear young friend—nay, let me warn you with all
seriousness, that should you leave these rooms you will not by any
chance go to sleep in any other part of the castle. It is old, and has
many memories, and there are bad dreams for those who sleep unwisely. Be
warned! Should sleep now or ever overcome you, or be like to do, then
haste to your own chamber or to these rooms, for your rest will then be
safe. But if you be not careful in this respect, then”—He finished his
speech in a gruesome way, for he motioned with his hands as if he were
washing them. I quite understood; my only doubt was as to whether any
dream could be more terrible than the unnatural, horrible net of gloom
and mystery which seemed closing around me.

Later.—I endorse the last words written, but this time there is no
doubt in question. I shall not fear to sleep in any place where he is
not. I have placed the crucifix over the head of my bed—I imagine that
my rest is thus freer from dreams; and there it shall remain.
When he left me I went to my room. After a little while, not hearing any
sound, I came out and went up the stone stair to where I could look out
towards the South. There was some sense of freedom in the vast expanse,
inaccessible though it was to me, as compared with the narrow darkness
of the courtyard. Looking out on this, I felt that I was indeed in
prison, and I seemed to want a breath of fresh air, though it were of
the night. I am beginning to feel this nocturnal existence tell on me.
It is destroying my nerve. I start at my own shadow, and am full of all
sorts of horrible imaginings. God knows that there is ground for my
terrible fear in this accursed place! I looked out over the beautiful
expanse, bathed in soft yellow moonlight till it was almost as light as
day. In the soft light the distant hills became melted, and the shadows
in the valleys and gorges of velvety blackness. The mere beauty seemed
to cheer me; there was peace and comfort in every breath I drew. As I
leaned from the window my eye was caught by something moving a storey
below me, and somewhat to my left, where I imagined, from the order of
the rooms, that the windows of the Count’s own room would look out. The
window at which I stood was tall and deep, stone-mullioned, and though
weatherworn, was still complete; but it was evidently many a day since
the case had been there. I drew back behind the stonework, and looked
carefully out.
What I saw was the Count’s head coming out from the window. I did not
see the face, but I knew the man by the neck and the movement of his
back and arms. In any case I could not mistake the hands which I had had
so many opportunities of studying. I was at first interested and
somewhat amused, for it is wonderful how small a matter will interest
and amuse a man when he is a prisoner. But my very feelings changed to
repulsion and terror when I saw the whole man slowly emerge from the
window and begin to crawl down the castle wall over that dreadful abyss,
face down with his cloak spreading out around him like great wings. At
first I could not believe my eyes. I thought it was some trick of the
moonlight, some weird effect of shadow; but I kept looking, and it could
be no delusion. I saw the fingers and toes grasp the corners of the
stones, worn clear of the mortar by the stress of years, and by thus
using every projection and inequality move downwards with considerable
speed, just as a lizard moves along a wall.
What manner of man is this, or what manner of creature is it in the
semblance of man? I feel the dread of this horrible place overpowering
me; I am in fear—in awful fear—and there is no escape for me; I am
encompassed about with terrors that I dare not think of....

15 May.—Once more have I seen the Count go out in his lizard fashion.
He moved downwards in a sidelong way, some hundred feet down, and a good
deal to the left. He vanished into some hole or window. When his head
had disappeared, I leaned out to try and see more, but without
avail—the distance was too great to allow a proper angle of sight. I
knew he had left the castle now, and thought to use the opportunity to
explore more than I had dared to do as yet. I went back to the room, and
taking a lamp, tried all the doors. They were all locked, as I had
expected, and the locks were comparatively new; but I went down the
stone stairs to the hall where I had entered originally. I found I could
pull back the bolts easily enough and unhook the great chains; but the
door was locked, and the key was gone! That key must be in the Count’s
room; I must watch should his door be unlocked, so that I may get it and
escape. I went on to make a thorough examination of the various stairs
and passages, and to try the doors that opened from them. One or two
small rooms near the hall were open, but there was nothing to see in
them except old furniture, dusty with age and moth-eaten. At last,
however, I found one door at the top of the stairway which, though it
seemed to be locked, gave a little under pressure. I tried it harder,
and found that it was not really locked, but that the resistance came
from the fact that the hinges had fallen somewhat, and the heavy door
rested on the floor. Here was an opportunity which I might not have
again, so I exerted myself, and with many efforts forced it back so that
I could enter. I was now in a wing of the castle further to the right
than the rooms I knew and a storey lower down. From the windows I could
see that the suite of rooms lay along to the south of the castle, the
windows of the end room looking out both west and south. On the latter
side, as well as to the former, there was a great precipice. The castle
was built on the corner of a great rock, so that on three sides it was
quite impregnable, and great windows were placed here where sling, or
bow, or culverin could not reach, and consequently light and comfort,
impossible to a position which had to be guarded, were secured. To the
west was a great valley, and then, rising far away, great jagged
mountain fastnesses, rising peak on peak, the sheer rock studded with
mountain ash and thorn, whose roots clung in cracks and crevices and
crannies of the stone. This was evidently the portion of the castle
occupied by the ladies in bygone days, for the furniture had more air of
comfort than any I had seen. The windows were curtainless, and the
yellow moonlight, flooding in through the diamond panes, enabled one to
see even colours, whilst it softened the wealth of dust which lay over
all and disguised in some measure the ravages of time and the moth. My
lamp seemed to be of little effect in the brilliant moonlight, but I was
glad to have it with me, for there was a dread loneliness in the place
which chilled my heart and made my nerves tremble. Still, it was better
than living alone in the rooms which I had come to hate from the
presence of the Count, and after trying a little to school my nerves, I
found a soft quietude come over me. Here I am, sitting at a little oak
table where in old times possibly some fair lady sat to pen, with much
thought and many blushes, her ill-spelt love-letter, and writing in my
diary in shorthand all that has happened since I closed it last. It is
nineteenth century up-to-date with a vengeance. And yet, unless my
senses deceive me, the old centuries had, and have, powers of their own
which mere “modernity” cannot kill.

Later: the Morning of 16 May.—God preserve my sanity, for to this I
am reduced. Safety and the assurance of safety are things of the past.
Whilst I live on here there is but one thing to hope for, that I may not
go mad, if, indeed, I be not mad already. If I be sane, then surely it
is maddening to think that of all the foul things that lurk in this
hateful place the Count is the least dreadful to me; that to him alone I
can look for safety, even though this be only whilst I can serve his
purpose. Great God! merciful God! Let me be calm, for out of that way
lies madness indeed. I begin to get new lights on certain things which
have puzzled me. Up to now I never quite knew what Shakespeare meant
when he made Hamlet say:—
for now, feeling as though my own brain were unhinged or as if the shock
had come which must end in its undoing, I turn to my diary for repose.
The habit of entering accurately must help to soothe me.
The Count’s mysterious warning frightened me at the time; it frightens
me more now when I think of it, for in future he has a fearful hold upon
me. I shall fear to doubt what he may say!
When I had written in my diary and had fortunately replaced the book and
pen in my pocket I felt sleepy. The Count’s warning came into my mind,
but I took a pleasure in disobeying it. The sense of sleep was upon me,
and with it the obstinacy which sleep brings as outrider. The soft
moonlight soothed, and the wide expanse without gave a sense of freedom
which refreshed me. I determined not to return to-night to the
gloom-haunted rooms, but to sleep here, where, of old, ladies had sat
and sung and lived sweet lives whilst their gentle breasts were sad for
their menfolk away in the midst of remorseless wars. I drew a great
couch out of its place near the corner, so that as I lay, I could look
at the lovely view to east and south, and unthinking of and uncaring for
the dust, composed myself for sleep. I suppose I must have fallen
asleep; I hope so, but I fear, for all that followed was startlingly
real—so real that now sitting here in the broad, full sunlight of the
morning, I cannot in the least believe that it was all sleep.
I was not alone. The room was the same, unchanged in any way since I
came into it; I could see along the floor, in the brilliant moonlight,
my own footsteps marked where I had disturbed the long accumulation of
dust. In the moonlight opposite me were three young women, ladies by
their dress and manner. I thought at the time that I must be dreaming
when I saw them, for, though the moonlight was behind them, they threw
no shadow on the floor. They came close to me, and looked at me for some
time, and then whispered together. Two were dark, and had high aquiline
noses, like the Count, and great dark, piercing eyes that seemed to be
almost red when contrasted with the pale yellow moon. The other was
fair, as fair as can be, with great wavy masses of golden hair and eyes
like pale sapphires. I seemed somehow to know her face, and to know it
in connection with some dreamy fear, but I could not recollect at the
moment how or where. All three had brilliant white teeth that shone like
pearls against the ruby of their voluptuous lips. There was something
about them that made me uneasy, some longing and at the same time some
deadly fear. I felt in my heart a wicked, burning desire that they would
kiss me with those red lips. It is not good to note this down, lest some
day it should meet Mina’s eyes and cause her pain; but it is the truth.
They whispered together, and then they all three laughed—such a
silvery, musical laugh, but as hard as though the sound never could have
come through the softness of human lips. It was like the intolerable,
tingling sweetness of water-glasses when played on by a cunning hand.
The fair girl shook her head coquettishly, and the other two urged her
on. One said:—
“Go on! You are first, and we shall follow; yours is the right to
begin.” The other added:—
“He is young and strong; there are kisses for us all.” I lay quiet,
looking out under my eyelashes in an agony of delightful anticipation.
The fair girl advanced and bent over me till I could feel the movement
of her breath upon me. Sweet it was in one sense, honey-sweet, and sent
the same tingling through the nerves as her voice, but with a bitter
underlying the sweet, a bitter offensiveness, as one smells in blood.
I was afraid to raise my eyelids, but looked out and saw perfectly under
the lashes. The girl went on her knees, and bent over me, simply
gloating. There was a deliberate voluptuousness which was both thrilling
and repulsive, and as she arched her neck she actually licked her lips
like an animal, till I could see in the moonlight the moisture shining
on the scarlet lips and on the red tongue as it lapped the white sharp
teeth. Lower and lower went her head as the lips went below the range of
my mouth and chin and seemed about to fasten on my throat. Then she
paused, and I could hear the churning sound of her tongue as it licked
her teeth and lips, and could feel the hot breath on my neck. Then the
skin of my throat began to tingle as one’s flesh does when the hand that
is to tickle it approaches nearer—nearer. I could feel the soft,
shivering touch of the lips on the super-sensitive skin of my throat,
and the hard dents of two sharp teeth, just touching and pausing there.
I closed my eyes in a languorous ecstasy and waited—waited with beating
heart.
But at that instant, another sensation swept through me as quick as
lightning. I was conscious of the presence of the Count, and of his
being as if lapped in a storm of fury. As my eyes opened involuntarily I
saw his strong hand grasp the slender neck of the fair woman and with
giant’s power draw it back, the blue eyes transformed with fury, the
white teeth champing with rage, and the fair cheeks blazing red with
passion. But the Count! Never did I imagine such wrath and fury, even to
the demons of the pit. His eyes were positively blazing. The red light
in them was lurid, as if the flames of hell-fire blazed behind them. His
face was deathly pale, and the lines of it were hard like drawn wires;
the thick eyebrows that met over the nose now seemed like a heaving bar
of white-hot metal. With a fierce sweep of his arm, he hurled the woman
from him, and then motioned to the others, as though he were beating
them back; it was the same imperious gesture that I had seen used to the
wolves. In a voice which, though low and almost in a whisper seemed to
cut through the air and then ring round the room he said:—
“How dare you touch him, any of you? How dare you cast eyes on him when
I had forbidden it? Back, I tell you all! This man belongs to me! Beware
how you meddle with him, or you’ll have to deal with me.” The fair girl,
with a laugh of ribald coquetry, turned to answer him:—
“You yourself never loved; you never love!” On this the other women
joined, and such a mirthless, hard, soulless laughter rang through the
room that it almost made me faint to hear; it seemed like the pleasure
of fiends. Then the Count turned, after looking at my face attentively,
and said in a soft whisper:—
“Yes, I too can love; you yourselves can tell it from the past. Is it
not so? Well, now I promise you that when I am done with him you shall
kiss him at your will. Now go! go! I must awaken him, for there is work
to be done.”
“Are we to have nothing to-night?” said one of them, with a low laugh,
as she pointed to the bag which he had thrown upon the floor, and which
moved as though there were some living thing within it. For answer he
nodded his head. One of the women jumped forward and opened it. If my
ears did not deceive me there was a gasp and a low wail, as of a
half-smothered child. The women closed round, whilst I was aghast with
horror; but as I looked they disappeared, and with them the dreadful
bag. There was no door near them, and they could not have passed me
without my noticing. They simply seemed to fade into the rays of the
moonlight and pass out through the window, for I could see outside the
dim, shadowy forms for a moment before they entirely faded away.
Then the horror overcame me, and I sank down unconscious.
I AWOKE in my own bed. If it be that I had not dreamt, the Count must
have carried me here. I tried to satisfy myself on the subject, but
could not arrive at any unquestionable result. To be sure, there were
certain small evidences, such as that my clothes were folded and laid by
in a manner which was not my habit. My watch was still unwound, and I am
rigorously accustomed to wind it the last thing before going to bed, and
many such details. But these things are no proof, for they may have been
evidences that my mind was not as usual, and, from some cause or
another, I had certainly been much upset. I must watch for proof. Of one
thing I am glad: if it was that the Count carried me here and undressed
me, he must have been hurried in his task, for my pockets are intact. I
am sure this diary would have been a mystery to him which he would not
have brooked. He would have taken or destroyed it. As I look round this
room, although it has been to me so full of fear, it is now a sort of
sanctuary, for nothing can be more dreadful than those awful women, who
were—who are—waiting to suck my blood.

18 May.—I have been down to look at that room again in daylight, for
I must know the truth. When I got to the doorway at the top of the
stairs I found it closed. It had been so forcibly driven against the
jamb that part of the woodwork was splintered. I could see that the bolt
of the lock had not been shot, but the door is fastened from the inside.
I fear it was no dream, and must act on this surmise.

19 May.—I am surely in the toils. Last night the Count asked me in
the suavest tones to write three letters, one saying that my work here
was nearly done, and that I should start for home within a few days,
another that I was starting on the next morning from the time of the
letter, and the third that I had left the castle and arrived at
Bistritz. I would fain have rebelled, but felt that in the present state
of things it would be madness to quarrel openly with the Count whilst I
am so absolutely in his power; and to refuse would be to excite his
suspicion and to arouse his anger. He knows that I know too much, and
that I must not live, lest I be dangerous to him; my only chance is to
prolong my opportunities. Something may occur which will give me a
chance to escape. I saw in his eyes something of that gathering wrath
which was manifest when he hurled that fair woman from him. He explained
to me that posts were few and uncertain, and that my writing now would
ensure ease of mind to my friends; and he assured me with so much
impressiveness that he would countermand the later letters, which would
be held over at Bistritz until due time in case chance would admit of my
prolonging my stay, that to oppose him would have been to create new
suspicion. I therefore pretended to fall in with his views, and asked
him what dates I should put on the letters. He calculated a minute, and
then said:—
“The first should be June 12, the second June 19, and the third June
29.”
I know now the span of my life. God help me!

28 May.—There is a chance of escape, or at any rate of being able to
send word home. A band of Szgany have come to the castle, and are
encamped in the courtyard. These Szgany are gipsies; I have notes of
them in my book. They are peculiar to this part of the world, though
allied to the ordinary gipsies all the world over. There are thousands
of them in Hungary and Transylvania, who are almost outside all law.
They attach themselves as a rule to some great noble or boyar, and
call themselves by his name. They are fearless and without religion,
save superstition, and they talk only their own varieties of the Romany
tongue.
I shall write some letters home, and shall try to get them to have them
posted. I have already spoken them through my window to begin
acquaintanceship. They took their hats off and made obeisance and many
signs, which, however, I could not understand any more than I could
their spoken language....

I have written the letters. Mina’s is in shorthand, and I simply ask Mr.
Hawkins to communicate with her. To her I have explained my situation,
but without the horrors which I may only surmise. It would shock and
frighten her to death were I to expose my heart to her. Should the
letters not carry, then the Count shall not yet know my secret or the
extent of my knowledge....

I have given the letters; I threw them through the bars of my window
with a gold piece, and made what signs I could to have them posted. The
man who took them pressed them to his heart and bowed, and then put them
in his cap. I could do no more. I stole back to the study, and began to
read. As the Count did not come in, I have written here....

The Count has come. He sat down beside me, and said in his smoothest
voice as he opened two letters:—
“The Szgany has given me these, of which, though I know not whence they
come, I shall, of course, take care. See!”—he must have looked at
it—“one is from you, and to my friend Peter Hawkins; the other”—here
he caught sight of the strange symbols as he opened the envelope, and
the dark look came into his face, and his eyes blazed wickedly—“the
other is a vile thing, an outrage upon friendship and hospitality! It is
not signed. Well! so it cannot matter to us.” And he calmly held letter
and envelope in the flame of the lamp till they were consumed. Then he
went on:—
“The letter to Hawkins—that I shall, of course, send on, since it is
yours. Your letters are sacred to me. Your pardon, my friend, that
unknowingly I did break the seal. Will you not cover it again?” He held
out the letter to me, and with a courteous bow handed me a clean
envelope. I could only redirect it and hand it to him in silence. When
he went out of the room I could hear the key turn softly. A minute later
I went over and tried it, and the door was locked.
When, an hour or two after, the Count came quietly into the room, his
coming awakened me, for I had gone to sleep on the sofa. He was very
courteous and very cheery in his manner, and seeing that I had been
sleeping, he said:—
“So, my friend, you are tired? Get to bed. There is the surest rest. I
may not have the pleasure to talk to-night, since there are many labours
to me; but you will sleep, I pray.” I passed to my room and went to bed,
and, strange to say, slept without dreaming. Despair has its own calms.

31 May.—This morning when I woke I thought I would provide myself
with some paper and envelopes from my bag and keep them in my pocket, so
that I might write in case I should get an opportunity, but again a
surprise, again a shock!
Every scrap of paper was gone, and with it all my notes, my memoranda,
relating to railways and travel, my letter of credit, in fact all that
might be useful to me were I once outside the castle. I sat and pondered
awhile, and then some thought occurred to me, and I made search of my
portmanteau and in the wardrobe where I had placed my clothes.
The suit in which I had travelled was gone, and also my overcoat and
rug; I could find no trace of them anywhere. This looked like some new
scheme of villainy....

17 June.—This morning, as I was sitting on the edge of my bed
cudgelling my brains, I heard without a cracking of whips and pounding
and scraping of horses’ feet up the rocky path beyond the courtyard.
With joy I hurried to the window, and saw drive into the yard two great
leiter-wagons, each drawn by eight sturdy horses, and at the head of
each pair a Slovak, with his wide hat, great nail-studded belt, dirty
sheepskin, and high boots. They had also their long staves in hand. I
ran to the door, intending to descend and try and join them through the
main hall, as I thought that way might be opened for them. Again a
shock: my door was fastened on the outside.
Then I ran to the window and cried to them. They looked up at me
stupidly and pointed, but just then the “hetman” of the Szgany came out,
and seeing them pointing to my window, said something, at which they
laughed. Henceforth no effort of mine, no piteous cry or agonised
entreaty, would make them even look at me. They resolutely turned away.
The leiter-wagons contained great, square boxes, with handles of thick
rope; these were evidently empty by the ease with which the Slovaks
handled them, and by their resonance as they were roughly moved. When
they were all unloaded and packed in a great heap in one corner of the
yard, the Slovaks were given some money by the Szgany, and spitting on
it for luck, lazily went each to his horse’s head. Shortly afterwards, I
heard the cracking of their whips die away in the distance.

24 June, before morning.—Last night the Count left me early, and
locked himself into his own room. As soon as I dared I ran up the
winding stair, and looked out of the window, which opened south. I
thought I would watch for the Count, for there is something going on.
The Szgany are quartered somewhere in the castle and are doing work of
some kind. I know it, for now and then I hear a far-away muffled sound
as of mattock and spade, and, whatever it is, it must be the end of some
ruthless villainy.
I had been at the window somewhat less than half an hour, when I saw
something coming out of the Count’s window. I drew back and watched
carefully, and saw the whole man emerge. It was a new shock to me to
find that he had on the suit of clothes which I had worn whilst
travelling here, and slung over his shoulder the terrible bag which I
had seen the women take away. There could be no doubt as to his quest,
and in my garb, too! This, then, is his new scheme of evil: that he will
allow others to see me, as they think, so that he may both leave
evidence that I have been seen in the towns or villages posting my own
letters, and that any wickedness which he may do shall by the local
people be attributed to me.
It makes me rage to think that this can go on, and whilst I am shut up
here, a veritable prisoner, but without that protection of the law which
is even a criminal’s right and consolation.
I thought I would watch for the Count’s return, and for a long time sat
doggedly at the window. Then I began to notice that there were some
quaint little specks floating in the rays of the moonlight. They were
like the tiniest grains of dust, and they whirled round and gathered in
clusters in a nebulous sort of way. I watched them with a sense of
soothing, and a sort of calm stole over me. I leaned back in the
embrasure in a more comfortable position, so that I could enjoy more
fully the aërial gambolling.
Something made me start up, a low, piteous howling of dogs somewhere far
below in the valley, which was hidden from my sight. Louder it seemed to
ring in my ears, and the floating motes of dust to take new shapes to
the sound as they danced in the moonlight. I felt myself struggling to
awake to some call of my instincts; nay, my very soul was struggling,
and my half-remembered sensibilities were striving to answer the call. I
was becoming hypnotised! Quicker and quicker danced the dust; the
moonbeams seemed to quiver as they went by me into the mass of gloom
beyond. More and more they gathered till they seemed to take dim phantom
shapes. And then I started, broad awake and in full possession of my
senses, and ran screaming from the place. The phantom shapes, which were
becoming gradually materialised from the moonbeams, were those of the
three ghostly women to whom I was doomed. I fled, and felt somewhat
safer in my own room, where there was no moonlight and where the lamp
was burning brightly.
When a couple of hours had passed I heard something stirring in the
Count’s room, something like a sharp wail quickly suppressed; and then
there was silence, deep, awful silence, which chilled me. With a
beating heart, I tried the door; but I was locked in my prison, and
could do nothing. I sat down and simply cried.
As I sat I heard a sound in the courtyard without—the agonised cry of a
woman. I rushed to the window, and throwing it up, peered out between
the bars. There, indeed, was a woman with dishevelled hair, holding her
hands over her heart as one distressed with running. She was leaning
against a corner of the gateway. When she saw my face at the window she
threw herself forward, and shouted in a voice laden with menace:—
“Monster, give me my child!”
She threw herself on her knees, and raising up her hands, cried the same
words in tones which wrung my heart. Then she tore her hair and beat her
breast, and abandoned herself to all the violences of extravagant
emotion. Finally, she threw herself forward, and, though I could not see
her, I could hear the beating of her naked hands against the door.
Somewhere high overhead, probably on the tower, I heard the voice of the
Count calling in his harsh, metallic whisper. His call seemed to be
answered from far and wide by the howling of wolves. Before many minutes
had passed a pack of them poured, like a pent-up dam when liberated,
through the wide entrance into the courtyard.
There was no cry from the woman, and the howling of the wolves was but
short. Before long they streamed away singly, licking their lips.
I could not pity her, for I knew now what had become of her child, and
she was better dead.
What shall I do? what can I do? How can I escape from this dreadful
thing of night and gloom and fear?

25 June, morning.—No man knows till he has suffered from the night
how sweet and how dear to his heart and eye the morning can be. When the
sun grew so high this morning that it struck the top of the great
gateway opposite my window, the high spot which it touched seemed to me
as if the dove from the ark had lighted there. My fear fell from me as
if it had been a vaporous garment which dissolved in the warmth. I must
take action of some sort whilst the courage of the day is upon me. Last
night one of my post-dated letters went to post, the first of that fatal
series which is to blot out the very traces of my existence from the
earth.
Let me not think of it. Action!
It has always been at night-time that I have been molested or
threatened, or in some way in danger or in fear. I have not yet seen the
Count in the daylight. Can it be that he sleeps when others wake, that
he may be awake whilst they sleep? If I could only get into his room!
But there is no possible way. The door is always locked, no way for me.
Yes, there is a way, if one dares to take it. Where his body has gone
why may not another body go? I have seen him myself crawl from his
window. Why should not I imitate him, and go in by his window? The
chances are desperate, but my need is more desperate still. I shall risk
it. At the worst it can only be death; and a man’s death is not a
calf’s, and the dreaded Hereafter may still be open to me. God help me
in my task! Good-bye, Mina, if I fail; good-bye, my faithful friend and
second father; good-bye, all, and last of all Mina!

Same day, later.—I have made the effort, and God, helping me, have
come safely back to this room. I must put down every detail in order. I
went whilst my courage was fresh straight to the window on the south
side, and at once got outside on the narrow ledge of stone which runs
around the building on this side. The stones are big and roughly cut,
and the mortar has by process of time been washed away between them. I
took off my boots, and ventured out on the desperate way. I looked down
once, so as to make sure that a sudden glimpse of the awful depth would
not overcome me, but after that kept my eyes away from it. I knew pretty
well the direction and distance of the Count’s window, and made for it
as well as I could, having regard to the opportunities available. I did
not feel dizzy—I suppose I was too excited—and the time seemed
ridiculously short till I found myself standing on the window-sill and
trying to raise up the sash. I was filled with agitation, however, when
I bent down and slid feet foremost in through the window. Then I looked
around for the Count, but, with surprise and gladness, made a discovery.
The room was empty! It was barely furnished with odd things, which
seemed to have never been used; the furniture was something the same
style as that in the south rooms, and was covered with dust. I looked
for the key, but it was not in the lock, and I could not find it
anywhere. The only thing I found was a great heap of gold in one
corner—gold of all kinds, Roman, and British, and Austrian, and
Hungarian, and Greek and Turkish money, covered with a film of dust, as
though it had lain long in the ground. None of it that I noticed was
less than three hundred years old. There were also chains and ornaments,
some jewelled, but all of them old and stained.
At one corner of the room was a heavy door. I tried it, for, since I
could not find the key of the room or the key of the outer door, which
was the main object of my search, I must make further examination, or
all my efforts would be in vain. It was open, and led through a stone
passage to a circular stairway, which went steeply down. I descended,
minding carefully where I went, for the stairs were dark, being only lit
by loopholes in the heavy masonry. At the bottom there was a dark,
tunnel-like passage, through which came a deathly, sickly odour, the
odour of old earth newly turned. As I went through the passage the smell
grew closer and heavier. At last I pulled open a heavy door which stood
ajar, and found myself in an old, ruined chapel, which had evidently
been used as a graveyard. The roof was broken, and in two places were
steps leading to vaults, but the ground had recently been dug over, and
the earth placed in great wooden boxes, manifestly those which had been
brought by the Slovaks. There was nobody about, and I made search for
any further outlet, but there was none. Then I went over every inch of
the ground, so as not to lose a chance. I went down even into the
vaults, where the dim light struggled, although to do so was a dread to
my very soul. Into two of these I went, but saw nothing except fragments
of old coffins and piles of dust; in the third, however, I made a
discovery.
There, in one of the great boxes, of which there were fifty in all, on a
pile of newly dug earth, lay the Count! He was either dead or asleep, I
could not say which—for the eyes were open and stony, but without the
glassiness of death—and the cheeks had the warmth of life through all
their pallor; the lips were as red as ever. But there was no sign of
movement, no pulse, no breath, no beating of the heart. I bent over him,
and tried to find any sign of life, but in vain. He could not have lain
there long, for the earthy smell would have passed away in a few hours.
By the side of the box was its cover, pierced with holes here and there.
I thought he might have the keys on him, but when I went to search I saw
the dead eyes, and in them, dead though they were, such a look of hate,
though unconscious of me or my presence, that I fled from the place, and
leaving the Count’s room by the window, crawled again up the castle
wall. Regaining my room, I threw myself panting upon the bed and tried
to think....

29 June.—To-day is the date of my last letter, and the Count has
taken steps to prove that it was genuine, for again I saw him leave the
castle by the same window, and in my clothes. As he went down the wall,
lizard fashion, I wished I had a gun or some lethal weapon, that I might
destroy him; but I fear that no weapon wrought alone by man’s hand would
have any effect on him. I dared not wait to see him return, for I feared
to see those weird sisters. I came back to the library, and read there
till I fell asleep.
I was awakened by the Count, who looked at me as grimly as a man can
look as he said:—
“To-morrow, my friend, we must part. You return to your beautiful
England, I to some work which may have such an end that we may never
meet. Your letter home has been despatched; to-morrow I shall not be
here, but all shall be ready for your journey. In the morning come the
Szgany, who have some labours of their own here, and also come some
Slovaks. When they have gone, my carriage shall come for you, and shall
bear you to the Borgo Pass to meet the diligence from Bukovina to
Bistritz. But I am in hopes that I shall see more of you at Castle
Dracula.” I suspected him, and determined to test his sincerity.
Sincerity! It seems like a profanation of the word to write it in
connection with such a monster, so asked him point-blank:—
“Why may I not go to-night?”
“Because, dear sir, my coachman and horses are away on a mission.”
“But I would walk with pleasure. I want to get away at once.” He smiled,
such a soft, smooth, diabolical smile that I knew there was some trick
behind his smoothness. He said:—
“And your baggage?”
“I do not care about it. I can send for it some other time.”
The Count stood up, and said, with a sweet courtesy which made me rub my
eyes, it seemed so real:—
“You English have a saying which is close to my heart, for its spirit is
that which rules our boyars: ‘Welcome the coming; speed the parting
guest.’ Come with me, my dear young friend. Not an hour shall you wait
in my house against your will, though sad am I at your going, and that
you so suddenly desire it. Come!” With a stately gravity, he, with the
lamp, preceded me down the stairs and along the hall. Suddenly he
stopped.
“Hark!”
Close at hand came the howling of many wolves. It was almost as if the
sound sprang up at the rising of his hand, just as the music of a great
orchestra seems to leap under the bâton of the conductor. After a pause
of a moment, he proceeded, in his stately way, to the door, drew back
the ponderous bolts, unhooked the heavy chains, and began to draw it
open.
To my intense astonishment I saw that it was unlocked. Suspiciously, I
looked all round, but could see no key of any kind.
As the door began to open, the howling of the wolves without grew louder
and angrier; their red jaws, with champing teeth, and their blunt-clawed
feet as they leaped, came in through the opening door. I knew then that
to struggle at the moment against the Count was useless. With such
allies as these at his command, I could do nothing. But still the door
continued slowly to open, and only the Count’s body stood in the gap.
Suddenly it struck me that this might be the moment and means of my
doom; I was to be given to the wolves, and at my own instigation. There
was a diabolical wickedness in the idea great enough for the Count, and
as a last chance I cried out:—
“Shut the door; I shall wait till morning!” and covered my face with my
hands to hide my tears of bitter disappointment. With one sweep of his
powerful arm, the Count threw the door shut, and the great bolts clanged
and echoed through the hall as they shot back into their places.
In silence we returned to the library, and after a minute or two I went
to my own room. The last I saw of Count Dracula was his kissing his hand
to me; with a red light of triumph in his eyes, and with a smile that
Judas in hell might be proud of.
When I was in my room and about to lie down, I thought I heard a
whispering at my door. I went to it softly and listened. Unless my ears
deceived me, I heard the voice of the Count:—
“Back, back, to your own place! Your time is not yet come. Wait! Have
patience! To-night is mine. To-morrow night is yours!” There was a low,
sweet ripple of laughter, and in a rage I threw open the door, and saw
without the three terrible women licking their lips. As I appeared they
all joined in a horrible laugh, and ran away.
I came back to my room and threw myself on my knees. It is then so near
the end? To-morrow! to-morrow! Lord, help me, and those to whom I am
dear!

30 June, morning.—These may be the last words I ever write in this
diary. I slept till just before the dawn, and when I woke threw myself
on my knees, for I determined that if Death came he should find me
ready.
At last I felt that subtle change in the air, and knew that the morning
had come. Then came the welcome cock-crow, and I felt that I was safe.
With a glad heart, I opened my door and ran down to the hall. I had seen
that the door was unlocked, and now escape was before me. With hands
that trembled with eagerness, I unhooked the chains and drew back the
massive bolts.
But the door would not move. Despair seized me. I pulled, and pulled, at
the door, and shook it till, massive as it was, it rattled in its
casement. I could see the bolt shot. It had been locked after I left the
Count.
Then a wild desire took me to obtain that key at any risk, and I
determined then and there to scale the wall again and gain the Count’s
room. He might kill me, but death now seemed the happier choice of
evils. Without a pause I rushed up to the east window, and scrambled
down the wall, as before, into the Count’s room. It was empty, but that
was as I expected. I could not see a key anywhere, but the heap of gold
remained. I went through the door in the corner and down the winding
stair and along the dark passage to the old chapel. I knew now well
enough where to find the monster I sought.
The great box was in the same place, close against the wall, but the lid
was laid on it, not fastened down, but with the nails ready in their
places to be hammered home. I knew I must reach the body for the key, so
I raised the lid, and laid it back against the wall; and then I saw
something which filled my very soul with horror. There lay the Count,
but looking as if his youth had been half renewed, for the white hair
and moustache were changed to dark iron-grey; the cheeks were fuller,
and the white skin seemed ruby-red underneath; the mouth was redder than
ever, for on the lips were gouts of fresh blood, which trickled from the
corners of the mouth and ran over the chin and neck. Even the deep,
burning eyes seemed set amongst swollen flesh, for the lids and pouches
underneath were bloated. It seemed as if the whole awful creature were
simply gorged with blood. He lay like a filthy leech, exhausted with his
repletion. I shuddered as I bent over to touch him, and every sense in
me revolted at the contact; but I had to search, or I was lost. The
coming night might see my own body a banquet in a similar way to those
horrid three. I felt all over the body, but no sign could I find of the
key. Then I stopped and looked at the Count. There was a mocking smile
on the bloated face which seemed to drive me mad. This was the being I
was helping to transfer to London, where, perhaps, for centuries to come
he might, amongst its teeming millions, satiate his lust for blood, and
create a new and ever-widening circle of semi-demons to batten on the
helpless. The very thought drove me mad. A terrible desire came upon me
to rid the world of such a monster. There was no lethal weapon at hand,
but I seized a shovel which the workmen had been using to fill the
cases, and lifting it high, struck, with the edge downward, at the
hateful face. But as I did so the head turned, and the eyes fell full
upon me, with all their blaze of basilisk horror. The sight seemed to
paralyse me, and the shovel turned in my hand and glanced from the face,
merely making a deep gash above the forehead. The shovel fell from my
hand across the box, and as I pulled it away the flange of the blade
caught the edge of the lid which fell over again, and hid the horrid
thing from my sight. The last glimpse I had was of the bloated face,
blood-stained and fixed with a grin of malice which would have held its
own in the nethermost hell.
I thought and thought what should be my next move, but my brain seemed
on fire, and I waited with a despairing feeling growing over me. As I
waited I heard in the distance a gipsy song sung by merry voices coming
closer, and through their song the rolling of heavy wheels and the
cracking of whips; the Szgany and the Slovaks of whom the Count had
spoken were coming. With a last look around and at the box which
contained the vile body, I ran from the place and gained the Count’s
room, determined to rush out at the moment the door should be opened.
With strained ears, I listened, and heard downstairs the grinding of the
key in the great lock and the falling back of the heavy door. There must
have been some other means of entry, or some one had a key for one of
the locked doors. Then there came the sound of many feet tramping and
dying away in some passage which sent up a clanging echo. I turned to
run down again towards the vault, where I might find the new entrance;
but at the moment there seemed to come a violent puff of wind, and the
door to the winding stair blew to with a shock that set the dust from
the lintels flying. When I ran to push it open, I found that it was
hopelessly fast. I was again a prisoner, and the net of doom was closing
round me more closely.
As I write there is in the passage below a sound of many tramping feet
and the crash of weights being set down heavily, doubtless the boxes,
with their freight of earth. There is a sound of hammering; it is the
box being nailed down. Now I can hear the heavy feet tramping again
along the hall, with many other idle feet coming behind them.
The door is shut, and the chains rattle; there is a grinding of the key
in the lock; I can hear the key withdraw: then another door opens and
shuts; I hear the creaking of lock and bolt.
Hark! in the courtyard and down the rocky way the roll of heavy wheels,
the crack of whips, and the chorus of the Szgany as they pass into the
distance.
I am alone in the castle with those awful women. Faugh! Mina is a woman,
and there is nought in common. They are devils of the Pit!
I shall not remain alone with them; I shall try to scale the castle wall
farther than I have yet attempted. I shall take some of the gold with
me, lest I want it later. I may find a way from this dreadful place.
And then away for home! away to the quickest and nearest train! away
from this cursed spot, from this cursed land, where the devil and his
children still walk with earthly feet!
At least God’s mercy is better than that of these monsters, and the
precipice is steep and high. At its foot a man may sleep—as a man.
Good-bye, all! Mina!
Letter from Miss Mina Murray to Miss Lucy Westenra.
“9 May.
“My dearest Lucy,—
“Forgive my long delay in writing, but I have been simply overwhelmed
with work. The life of an assistant schoolmistress is sometimes trying.
I am longing to be with you, and by the sea, where we can talk together
freely and build our castles in the air. I have been working very hard
lately, because I want to keep up with Jonathan’s studies, and I have
been practising shorthand very assiduously. When we are married I shall
be able to be useful to Jonathan, and if I can stenograph well enough I
can take down what he wants to say in this way and write it out for him
on the typewriter, at which also I am practising very hard. He and I
sometimes write letters in shorthand, and he is keeping a stenographic
journal of his travels abroad. When I am with you I shall keep a diary
in the same way. I don’t mean one of those
two-pages-to-the-week-with-Sunday-squeezed-in-a-corner diaries, but a
sort of journal which I can write in whenever I feel inclined. I do not
suppose there will be much of interest to other people; but it is not
intended for them. I may show it to Jonathan some day if there is in it
anything worth sharing, but it is really an exercise book. I shall try
to do what I see lady journalists do: interviewing and writing
descriptions and trying to remember conversations. I am told that, with
a little practice, one can remember all that goes on or that one hears
said during a day. However, we shall see. I will tell you of my little
plans when we meet. I have just had a few hurried lines from Jonathan
from Transylvania. He is well, and will be returning in about a week. I
am longing to hear all his news. It must be so nice to see strange
countries. I wonder if we—I mean Jonathan and I—shall ever see them
together. There is the ten o’clock bell ringing. Good-bye.
“Your loving
“Mina.
“Tell me all the news when you write. You have not told me anything for
a long time. I hear rumours, and especially of a tall, handsome,
curly-haired man???”
Letter, Lucy Westenra to Mina Murray.
“17, Chatham Street,
“Wednesday.
“My dearest Mina,—
“I must say you tax me very unfairly with being a bad correspondent. I
wrote to you twice since we parted, and your last letter was only your
second. Besides, I have nothing to tell you. There is really nothing
to interest you. Town is very pleasant just now, and we go a good deal
to picture-galleries and for walks and rides in the park. As to the
tall, curly-haired man, I suppose it was the one who was with me at the
last Pop. Some one has evidently been telling tales. That was Mr.
Holmwood. He often comes to see us, and he and mamma get on very well
together; they have so many things to talk about in common. We met some
time ago a man that would just do for you, if you were not already
engaged to Jonathan. He is an excellent parti, being handsome, well
off, and of good birth. He is a doctor and really clever. Just fancy! He
is only nine-and-twenty, and he has an immense lunatic asylum all under
his own care. Mr. Holmwood introduced him to me, and he called here to
see us, and often comes now. I think he is one of the most resolute men
I ever saw, and yet the most calm. He seems absolutely imperturbable. I
can fancy what a wonderful power he must have over his patients. He has
a curious habit of looking one straight in the face, as if trying to
read one’s thoughts. He tries this on very much with me, but I flatter
myself he has got a tough nut to crack. I know that from my glass. Do
you ever try to read your own face? I do, and I can tell you it is not
a bad study, and gives you more trouble than you can well fancy if you
have never tried it. He says that I afford him a curious psychological
study, and I humbly think I do. I do not, as you know, take sufficient
interest in dress to be able to describe the new fashions. Dress is a
bore. That is slang again, but never mind; Arthur says that every day.
There, it is all out. Mina, we have told all our secrets to each other
since we were children; we have slept together and eaten together, and
laughed and cried together; and now, though I have spoken, I would like
to speak more. Oh, Mina, couldn’t you guess? I love him. I am blushing
as I write, for although I think he loves me, he has not told me so in
words. But oh, Mina, I love him; I love him; I love him! There, that
does me good. I wish I were with you, dear, sitting by the fire
undressing, as we used to sit; and I would try to tell you what I feel.
I do not know how I am writing this even to you. I am afraid to stop,
or I should tear up the letter, and I don’t want to stop, for I do so
want to tell you all. Let me hear from you at once, and tell me all
that you think about it. Mina, I must stop. Good-night. Bless me in your
prayers; and, Mina, pray for my happiness.
“LUCY.
“P.S.—I need not tell you this is a secret. Good-night again.
“L.”
Letter, Lucy Westenra to Mina Murray.
“24 May.
“My dearest Mina,—
“Thanks, and thanks, and thanks again for your sweet letter. It was so
nice to be able to tell you and to have your sympathy.
“My dear, it never rains but it pours. How true the old proverbs are.
Here am I, who shall be twenty in September, and yet I never had a
proposal till to-day, not a real proposal, and to-day I have had three.
Just fancy! THREE proposals in one day! Isn’t it awful! I feel sorry,
really and truly sorry, for two of the poor fellows. Oh, Mina, I am so
happy that I don’t know what to do with myself. And three proposals!
But, for goodness’ sake, don’t tell any of the girls, or they would be
getting all sorts of extravagant ideas and imagining themselves injured
and slighted if in their very first day at home they did not get six at
least. Some girls are so vain! You and I, Mina dear, who are engaged and
are going to settle down soon soberly into old married women, can
despise vanity. Well, I must tell you about the three, but you must keep
it a secret, dear, from every one, except, of course, Jonathan. You
will tell him, because I would, if I were in your place, certainly tell
Arthur. A woman ought to tell her husband everything—don’t you think
so, dear?—and I must be fair. Men like women, certainly their wives, to
be quite as fair as they are; and women, I am afraid, are not always
quite as fair as they should be. Well, my dear, number One came just
before lunch. I told you of him, Dr. John Seward, the lunatic-asylum
man, with the strong jaw and the good forehead. He was very cool
outwardly, but was nervous all the same. He had evidently been schooling
himself as to all sorts of little things, and remembered them; but he
almost managed to sit down on his silk hat, which men don’t generally do
when they are cool, and then when he wanted to appear at ease he kept
playing with a lancet in a way that made me nearly scream. He spoke to
me, Mina, very straightforwardly. He told me how dear I was to him,
though he had known me so little, and what his life would be with me to
help and cheer him. He was going to tell me how unhappy he would be if I
did not care for him, but when he saw me cry he said that he was a brute
and would not add to my present trouble. Then he broke off and asked if
I could love him in time; and when I shook my head his hands trembled,
and then with some hesitation he asked me if I cared already for any one
else. He put it very nicely, saying that he did not want to wring my
confidence from me, but only to know, because if a woman’s heart was
free a man might have hope. And then, Mina, I felt a sort of duty to
tell him that there was some one. I only told him that much, and then he
stood up, and he looked very strong and very grave as he took both my
hands in his and said he hoped I would be happy, and that if I ever
wanted a friend I must count him one of my best. Oh, Mina dear, I can’t
help crying: and you must excuse this letter being all blotted. Being
proposed to is all very nice and all that sort of thing, but it isn’t at
all a happy thing when you have to see a poor fellow, whom you know
loves you honestly, going away and looking all broken-hearted, and to
know that, no matter what he may say at the moment, you are passing
quite out of his life. My dear, I must stop here at present, I feel so
miserable, though I am so happy.
“Evening.
“Arthur has just gone, and I feel in better spirits than when I left
off, so I can go on telling you about the day. Well, my dear, number Two
came after lunch. He is such a nice fellow, an American from Texas, and
he looks so young and so fresh that it seems almost impossible that he
has been to so many places and has had such adventures. I sympathise
with poor Desdemona when she had such a dangerous stream poured in her
ear, even by a black man. I suppose that we women are such cowards that
we think a man will save us from fears, and we marry him. I know now
what I would do if I were a man and wanted to make a girl love me. No, I
don’t, for there was Mr. Morris telling us his stories, and Arthur never
told any, and yet—— My dear, I am somewhat previous. Mr. Quincey P.
Morris found me alone. It seems that a man always does find a girl
alone. No, he doesn’t, for Arthur tried twice to make a chance, and I
helping him all I could; I am not ashamed to say it now. I must tell you
beforehand that Mr. Morris doesn’t always speak slang—that is to say,
he never does so to strangers or before them, for he is really well
educated and has exquisite manners—but he found out that it amused me
to hear him talk American slang, and whenever I was present, and there
was no one to be shocked, he said such funny things. I am afraid, my
dear, he has to invent it all, for it fits exactly into whatever else he
has to say. But this is a way slang has. I do not know myself if I shall
ever speak slang; I do not know if Arthur likes it, as I have never
heard him use any as yet. Well, Mr. Morris sat down beside me and looked
as happy and jolly as he could, but I could see all the same that he was
very nervous. He took my hand in his, and said ever so sweetly:—
“‘Miss Lucy, I know I ain’t good enough to regulate the fixin’s of your
little shoes, but I guess if you wait till you find a man that is you
will go join them seven young women with the lamps when you quit. Won’t
you just hitch up alongside of me and let us go down the long road
together, driving in double harness?’
“Well, he did look so good-humoured and so jolly that it didn’t seem
half so hard to refuse him as it did poor Dr. Seward; so I said, as
lightly as I could, that I did not know anything of hitching, and that I
wasn’t broken to harness at all yet. Then he said that he had spoken in
a light manner, and he hoped that if he had made a mistake in doing so
on so grave, so momentous, an occasion for him, I would forgive him. He
really did look serious when he was saying it, and I couldn’t help
feeling a bit serious too—I know, Mina, you will think me a horrid
flirt—though I couldn’t help feeling a sort of exultation that he was
number two in one day. And then, my dear, before I could say a word he
began pouring out a perfect torrent of love-making, laying his very
heart and soul at my feet. He looked so earnest over it that I shall
never again think that a man must be playful always, and never earnest,
because he is merry at times. I suppose he saw something in my face
which checked him, for he suddenly stopped, and said with a sort of
manly fervour that I could have loved him for if I had been free:—
“‘Lucy, you are an honest-hearted girl, I know. I should not be here
speaking to you as I am now if I did not believe you clean grit, right
through to the very depths of your soul. Tell me, like one good fellow
to another, is there any one else that you care for? And if there is
I’ll never trouble you a hair’s breadth again, but will be, if you will
let me, a very faithful friend.’
“My dear Mina, why are men so noble when we women are so little worthy
of them? Here was I almost making fun of this great-hearted, true
gentleman. I burst into tears—I am afraid, my dear, you will think
this a very sloppy letter in more ways than one—and I really felt very
badly. Why can’t they let a girl marry three men, or as many as want
her, and save all this trouble? But this is heresy, and I must not say
it. I am glad to say that, though I was crying, I was able to look into
Mr. Morris’s brave eyes, and I told him out straight:—
“‘Yes, there is some one I love, though he has not told me yet that he
even loves me.’ I was right to speak to him so frankly, for quite a
light came into his face, and he put out both his hands and took mine—I
think I put them into his—and said in a hearty way:—
“‘That’s my brave girl. It’s better worth being late for a chance of
winning you than being in time for any other girl in the world. Don’t
cry, my dear. If it’s for me, I’m a hard nut to crack; and I take it
standing up. If that other fellow doesn’t know his happiness, well, he’d
better look for it soon, or he’ll have to deal with me. Little girl,
your honesty and pluck have made me a friend, and that’s rarer than a
lover; it’s more unselfish anyhow. My dear, I’m going to have a pretty
lonely walk between this and Kingdom Come. Won’t you give me one kiss?
It’ll be something to keep off the darkness now and then. You can, you
know, if you like, for that other good fellow—he must be a good fellow,
my dear, and a fine fellow, or you could not love him—hasn’t spoken
yet.’ That quite won me, Mina, for it was brave and sweet of him, and
noble, too, to a rival—wasn’t it?—and he so sad; so I leant over and
kissed him. He stood up with my two hands in his, and as he looked down
into my face—I am afraid I was blushing very much—he said:—
“‘Little girl, I hold your hand, and you’ve kissed me, and if these
things don’t make us friends nothing ever will. Thank you for your sweet
honesty to me, and good-bye.’ He wrung my hand, and taking up his hat,
went straight out of the room without looking back, without a tear or a
quiver or a pause; and I am crying like a baby. Oh, why must a man like
that be made unhappy when there are lots of girls about who would
worship the very ground he trod on? I know I would if I were free—only
I don’t want to be free. My dear, this quite upset me, and I feel I
cannot write of happiness just at once, after telling you of it; and I
don’t wish to tell of the number three until it can be all happy.
“Ever your loving
“Lucy.

“P.S.—Oh, about number Three—I needn’t tell you of number Three, need
I? Besides, it was all so confused; it seemed only a moment from his
coming into the room till both his arms were round me, and he was
kissing me. I am very, very happy, and I don’t know what I have done to
deserve it. I must only try in the future to show that I am not
ungrateful to God for all His goodness to me in sending to me such a
lover, such a husband, and such a friend.
“Good-bye.”
Dr. Seward’s Diary.
(Kept in phonograph)
25 May.—Ebb tide in appetite to-day. Cannot eat, cannot rest, so
diary instead. Since my rebuff of yesterday I have a sort of empty
feeling; nothing in the world seems of sufficient importance to be worth
the doing.... As I knew that the only cure for this sort of thing was
work, I went down amongst the patients. I picked out one who has
afforded me a study of much interest. He is so quaint that I am
determined to understand him as well as I can. To-day I seemed to get
nearer than ever before to the heart of his mystery.
I questioned him more fully than I had ever done, with a view to making
myself master of the facts of his hallucination. In my manner of doing
it there was, I now see, something of cruelty. I seemed to wish to keep
him to the point of his madness—a thing which I avoid with the patients
as I would the mouth of hell.
(Mem., under what circumstances would I not avoid the pit of hell?)
Omnia Romæ venalia sunt. Hell has its price! verb. sap. If there be
anything behind this instinct it will be valuable to trace it afterwards
accurately, so I had better commence to do so, therefore—
R. M. Renfield, ætat 59.—Sanguine temperament; great physical strength;
morbidly excitable; periods of gloom, ending in some fixed idea which I
cannot make out. I presume that the sanguine temperament itself and the
disturbing influence end in a mentally-accomplished finish; a possibly
dangerous man, probably dangerous if unselfish. In selfish men caution
is as secure an armour for their foes as for themselves. What I think of
on this point is, when self is the fixed point the centripetal force is
balanced with the centrifugal; when duty, a cause, etc., is the fixed
point, the latter force is paramount, and only accident or a series of
accidents can balance it.
Letter, Quincey P. Morris to Hon. Arthur Holmwood.
“25 May.
“My dear Art,—
“We’ve told yarns by the camp-fire in the prairies; and dressed one
another’s wounds after trying a landing at the Marquesas; and drunk
healths on the shore of Titicaca. There are more yarns to be told, and
other wounds to be healed, and another health to be drunk. Won’t you let
this be at my camp-fire to-morrow night? I have no hesitation in asking
you, as I know a certain lady is engaged to a certain dinner-party, and

24 July. Whitby.—Lucy met me at the station, looking sweeter and
lovelier than ever, and we drove up to the house at the Crescent in
which they have rooms. This is a lovely place. The little river, the
Esk, runs through a deep valley, which broadens out as it comes near the
harbour. A great viaduct runs across, with high piers, through which the
view seems somehow further away than it really is. The valley is
beautifully green, and it is so steep that when you are on the high land
on either side you look right across it, unless you are near enough to
see down. The houses of the old town—the side away from us—are all
red-roofed, and seem piled up one over the other anyhow, like the
pictures we see of Nuremberg. Right over the town is the ruin of Whitby
Abbey, which was sacked by the Danes, and which is the scene of part of
“Marmion,” where the girl was built up in the wall. It is a most noble
ruin, of immense size, and full of beautiful and romantic bits; there is
a legend that a white lady is seen in one of the windows. Between it and
the town there is another church, the parish one, round which is a big
graveyard, all full of tombstones. This is to my mind the nicest spot in
Whitby, for it lies right over the town, and has a full view of the
harbour and all up the bay to where the headland called Kettleness
stretches out into the sea. It descends so steeply over the harbour that
part of the bank has fallen away, and some of the graves have been
destroyed. In one place part of the stonework of the graves stretches
out over the sandy pathway far below. There are walks, with seats beside
them, through the churchyard; and people go and sit there all day long
looking at the beautiful view and enjoying the breeze. I shall come and
sit here very often myself and work. Indeed, I am writing now, with my
book on my knee, and listening to the talk of three old men who are
sitting beside me. They seem to do nothing all day but sit up here and
talk.
The harbour lies below me, with, on the far side, one long granite wall
stretching out into the sea, with a curve outwards at the end of it, in
the middle of which is a lighthouse. A heavy sea-wall runs along outside
of it. On the near side, the sea-wall makes an elbow crooked inversely,
and its end too has a lighthouse. Between the two piers there is a
narrow opening into the harbour, which then suddenly widens.
It is nice at high water; but when the tide is out it shoals away to
nothing, and there is merely the stream of the Esk, running between
banks of sand, with rocks here and there. Outside the harbour on this
side there rises for about half a mile a great reef, the sharp edge of
which runs straight out from behind the south lighthouse. At the end of
it is a buoy with a bell, which swings in bad weather, and sends in a
mournful sound on the wind. They have a legend here that when a ship is
lost bells are heard out at sea. I must ask the old man about this; he
is coming this way....
He is a funny old man. He must be awfully old, for his face is all
gnarled and twisted like the bark of a tree. He tells me that he is
nearly a hundred, and that he was a sailor in the Greenland fishing
fleet when Waterloo was fought. He is, I am afraid, a very sceptical
person, for when I asked him about the bells at sea and the White Lady
at the abbey he said very brusquely:—
“I wouldn’t fash masel’ about them, miss. Them things be all wore out.
Mind, I don’t say that they never was, but I do say that they wasn’t in
my time. They be all very well for comers and trippers, an’ the like,
but not for a nice young lady like you. Them feet-folks from York and
Leeds that be always eatin’ cured herrin’s an’ drinkin’ tea an’ lookin’
out to buy cheap jet would creed aught. I wonder masel’ who’d be
bothered tellin’ lies to them—even the newspapers, which is full of
fool-talk.” I thought he would be a good person to learn interesting
things from, so I asked him if he would mind telling me something about
the whale-fishing in the old days. He was just settling himself to begin
when the clock struck six, whereupon he laboured to get up, and said:—
“I must gang ageeanwards home now, miss. My grand-daughter doesn’t like
to be kept waitin’ when the tea is ready, for it takes me time to
crammle aboon the grees, for there be a many of ’em; an’, miss, I lack
belly-timber sairly by the clock.”
He hobbled away, and I could see him hurrying, as well as he could, down
the steps. The steps are a great feature on the place. They lead from
the town up to the church, there are hundreds of them—I do not know how
many—and they wind up in a delicate curve; the slope is so gentle that
a horse could easily walk up and down them. I think they must originally
have had something to do with the abbey. I shall go home too. Lucy went
out visiting with her mother, and as they were only duty calls, I did
not go. They will be home by this.

1 August.—I came up here an hour ago with Lucy, and we had a most
interesting talk with my old friend and the two others who always come
and join him. He is evidently the Sir Oracle of them, and I should think
must have been in his time a most dictatorial person. He will not admit
anything, and downfaces everybody. If he can’t out-argue them he bullies
them, and then takes their silence for agreement with his views. Lucy
was looking sweetly pretty in her white lawn frock; she has got a
beautiful colour since she has been here. I noticed that the old men did
not lose any time in coming up and sitting near her when we sat down.
She is so sweet with old people; I think they all fell in love with her
on the spot. Even my old man succumbed and did not contradict her, but
gave me double share instead. I got him on the subject of the legends,
and he went off at once into a sort of sermon. I must try to remember it
and put it down:—
“It be all fool-talk, lock, stock, and barrel; that’s what it be, an’
nowt else. These bans an’ wafts an’ boh-ghosts an’ barguests an’ bogles
an’ all anent them is only fit to set bairns an’ dizzy women
a-belderin’. They be nowt but air-blebs. They, an’ all grims an’ signs
an’ warnin’s, be all invented by parsons an’ illsome beuk-bodies an’
railway touters to skeer an’ scunner hafflin’s, an’ to get folks to do
somethin’ that they don’t other incline to. It makes me ireful to think
o’ them. Why, it’s them that, not content with printin’ lies on paper
an’ preachin’ them out of pulpits, does want to be cuttin’ them on the
tombstones. Look here all around you in what airt ye will; all them
steans, holdin’ up their heads as well as they can out of their pride,
is acant—simply tumblin’ down with the weight o’ the lies wrote on
them, ‘Here lies the body’ or ‘Sacred to the memory’ wrote on all of
them, an’ yet in nigh half of them there bean’t no bodies at all; an’
the memories of them bean’t cared a pinch of snuff about, much less
sacred. Lies all of them, nothin’ but lies of one kind or another! My
gog, but it’ll be a quare scowderment at the Day of Judgment when they
come tumblin’ up in their death-sarks, all jouped together an’ tryin’ to
drag their tombsteans with them to prove how good they was; some of them
trimmlin’ and ditherin’, with their hands that dozzened an’ slippy from
lyin’ in the sea that they can’t even keep their grup o’ them.”
I could see from the old fellow’s self-satisfied air and the way in
which he looked round for the approval of his cronies that he was
“showing off,” so I put in a word to keep him going:—
“Oh, Mr. Swales, you can’t be serious. Surely these tombstones are not
all wrong?”
“Yabblins! There may be a poorish few not wrong, savin’ where they make
out the people too good; for there be folk that do think a balm-bowl be
like the sea, if only it be their own. The whole thing be only lies. Now
look you here; you come here a stranger, an’ you see this kirk-garth.” I
nodded, for I thought it better to assent, though I did not quite
understand his dialect. I knew it had something to do with the church.
He went on: “And you consate that all these steans be aboon folk that be
happed here, snod an’ snog?” I assented again. “Then that be just where
the lie comes in. Why, there be scores of these lay-beds that be toom as
old Dun’s ’bacca-box on Friday night.” He nudged one of his companions,
and they all laughed. “And my gog! how could they be otherwise? Look at
that one, the aftest abaft the bier-bank: read it!” I went over and
read:—
“Edward Spencelagh, master mariner, murdered by pirates off the coast of
Andres, April, 1854, æt. 30.” When I came back Mr. Swales went on:—
“Who brought him home, I wonder, to hap him here? Murdered off the coast
of Andres! an’ you consated his body lay under! Why, I could name ye a
dozen whose bones lie in the Greenland seas above”—he pointed
northwards—“or where the currents may have drifted them. There be the
steans around ye. Ye can, with your young eyes, read the small-print of
the lies from here. This Braithwaite Lowrey—I knew his father, lost in
the Lively off Greenland in ’20; or Andrew Woodhouse, drowned in the
same seas in 1777; or John Paxton, drowned off Cape Farewell a year
later; or old John Rawlings, whose grandfather sailed with me, drowned
in the Gulf of Finland in ’50. Do ye think that all these men will have
to make a rush to Whitby when the trumpet sounds? I have me antherums
aboot it! I tell ye that when they got here they’d be jommlin’ an’
jostlin’ one another that way that it ’ud be like a fight up on the ice
in the old days, when we’d be at one another from daylight to dark, an’
tryin’ to tie up our cuts by the light of the aurora borealis.” This was
evidently local pleasantry, for the old man cackled over it, and his
cronies joined in with gusto.
“But,” I said, “surely you are not quite correct, for you start on the
assumption that all the poor people, or their spirits, will have to
take their tombstones with them on the Day of Judgment. Do you think
that will be really necessary?”
“Well, what else be they tombstones for? Answer me that, miss!”
“To please their relatives, I suppose.”
“To please their relatives, you suppose!” This he said with intense
scorn. “How will it pleasure their relatives to know that lies is wrote
over them, and that everybody in the place knows that they be lies?” He
pointed to a stone at our feet which had been laid down as a slab, on
which the seat was rested, close to the edge of the cliff. “Read the
lies on that thruff-stean,” he said. The letters were upside down to me
from where I sat, but Lucy was more opposite to them, so she leant over
and read:—
“Sacred to the memory of George Canon, who died, in the hope of a
glorious resurrection, on July, 29, 1873, falling from the rocks at
Kettleness. This tomb was erected by his sorrowing mother to her dearly
beloved son. ‘He was the only son of his mother, and she was a widow.’
Really, Mr. Swales, I don’t see anything very funny in that!” She spoke
her comment very gravely and somewhat severely.
“Ye don’t see aught funny! Ha! ha! But that’s because ye don’t gawm the
sorrowin’ mother was a hell-cat that hated him because he was
acrewk’d—a regular lamiter he was—an’ he hated her so that he
committed suicide in order that she mightn’t get an insurance she put on
his life. He blew nigh the top of his head off with an old musket that
they had for scarin’ the crows with. ’Twarn’t for crows then, for it
brought the clegs and the dowps to him. That’s the way he fell off the
rocks. And, as to hopes of a glorious resurrection, I’ve often heard him
say masel’ that he hoped he’d go to hell, for his mother was so pious
that she’d be sure to go to heaven, an’ he didn’t want to addle where
she was. Now isn’t that stean at any rate”—he hammered it with his
stick as he spoke—“a pack of lies? and won’t it make Gabriel keckle
when Geordie comes pantin’ up the grees with the tombstean balanced on
his hump, and asks it to be took as evidence!”
I did not know what to say, but Lucy turned the conversation as she
said, rising up:—
“Oh, why did you tell us of this? It is my favourite seat, and I cannot
leave it; and now I find I must go on sitting over the grave of a
suicide.”
“That won’t harm ye, my pretty; an’ it may make poor Geordie gladsome to
have so trim a lass sittin’ on his lap. That won’t hurt ye. Why, I’ve
sat here off an’ on for nigh twenty years past, an’ it hasn’t done me
no harm. Don’t ye fash about them as lies under ye, or that doesn’ lie
there either! It’ll be time for ye to be getting scart when ye see the
tombsteans all run away with, and the place as bare as a stubble-field.
There’s the clock, an’ I must gang. My service to ye, ladies!” And off
he hobbled.
Lucy and I sat awhile, and it was all so beautiful before us that we
took hands as we sat; and she told me all over again about Arthur and
their coming marriage. That made me just a little heart-sick, for I
haven’t heard from Jonathan for a whole month.

The same day. I came up here alone, for I am very sad. There was no
letter for me. I hope there cannot be anything the matter with Jonathan.
The clock has just struck nine. I see the lights scattered all over the
town, sometimes in rows where the streets are, and sometimes singly;
they run right up the Esk and die away in the curve of the valley. To my
left the view is cut off by a black line of roof of the old house next
the abbey. The sheep and lambs are bleating in the fields away behind
me, and there is a clatter of a donkey’s hoofs up the paved road below.
The band on the pier is playing a harsh waltz in good time, and further
along the quay there is a Salvation Army meeting in a back street.
Neither of the bands hears the other, but up here I hear and see them
both. I wonder where Jonathan is and if he is thinking of me! I wish he
were here.
Dr. Seward’s Diary.
5 June.—The case of Renfield grows more interesting the more I get to
understand the man. He has certain qualities very largely developed;
selfishness, secrecy, and purpose. I wish I could get at what is the
object of the latter. He seems to have some settled scheme of his own,
but what it is I do not yet know. His redeeming quality is a love of
animals, though, indeed, he has such curious turns in it that I
sometimes imagine he is only abnormally cruel. His pets are of odd
sorts. Just now his hobby is catching flies. He has at present such a
quantity that I have had myself to expostulate. To my astonishment, he
did not break out into a fury, as I expected, but took the matter in
simple seriousness. He thought for a moment, and then said: “May I have
three days? I shall clear them away.” Of course, I said that would do. I
must watch him.

18 June.—He has turned his mind now to spiders, and has got several
very big fellows in a box. He keeps feeding them with his flies, and
the number of the latter is becoming sensibly diminished, although he
has used half his food in attracting more flies from outside to his
room.

1 July.—His spiders are now becoming as great a nuisance as his
flies, and to-day I told him that he must get rid of them. He looked
very sad at this, so I said that he must clear out some of them, at all
events. He cheerfully acquiesced in this, and I gave him the same time
as before for reduction. He disgusted me much while with him, for when a
horrid blow-fly, bloated with some carrion food, buzzed into the room,
he caught it, held it exultantly for a few moments between his finger
and thumb, and, before I knew what he was going to do, put it in his
mouth and ate it. I scolded him for it, but he argued quietly that it
was very good and very wholesome; that it was life, strong life, and
gave life to him. This gave me an idea, or the rudiment of one. I must
watch how he gets rid of his spiders. He has evidently some deep problem
in his mind, for he keeps a little note-book in which he is always
jotting down something. Whole pages of it are filled with masses of
figures, generally single numbers added up in batches, and then the
totals added in batches again, as though he were “focussing” some
account, as the auditors put it.

8 July.—There is a method in his madness, and the rudimentary idea in
my mind is growing. It will be a whole idea soon, and then, oh,
unconscious cerebration! you will have to give the wall to your
conscious brother. I kept away from my friend for a few days, so that I
might notice if there were any change. Things remain as they were except
that he has parted with some of his pets and got a new one. He has
managed to get a sparrow, and has already partially tamed it. His means
of taming is simple, for already the spiders have diminished. Those that
do remain, however, are well fed, for he still brings in the flies by
tempting them with his food.

19 July.—We are progressing. My friend has now a whole colony of
sparrows, and his flies and spiders are almost obliterated. When I came
in he ran to me and said he wanted to ask me a great favour—a very,
very great favour; and as he spoke he fawned on me like a dog. I asked
him what it was, and he said, with a sort of rapture in his voice and
bearing:—
“A kitten, a nice little, sleek playful kitten, that I can play with,
and teach, and feed—and feed—and feed!” I was not unprepared for this
request, for I had noticed how his pets went on increasing in size and
vivacity, but I did not care that his pretty family of tame sparrows
should be wiped out in the same manner as the flies and the spiders; so
I said I would see about it, and asked him if he would not rather have a
cat than a kitten. His eagerness betrayed him as he answered:—
“Oh, yes, I would like a cat! I only asked for a kitten lest you should
refuse me a cat. No one would refuse me a kitten, would they?” I shook
my head, and said that at present I feared it would not be possible, but
that I would see about it. His face fell, and I could see a warning of
danger in it, for there was a sudden fierce, sidelong look which meant
killing. The man is an undeveloped homicidal maniac. I shall test him
with his present craving and see how it will work out; then I shall know
more.

10 p. m.—I have visited him again and found him sitting in a corner
brooding. When I came in he threw himself on his knees before me and
implored me to let him have a cat; that his salvation depended upon it.
I was firm, however, and told him that he could not have it, whereupon
he went without a word, and sat down, gnawing his fingers, in the corner
where I had found him. I shall see him in the morning early.

20 July.—Visited Renfield very early, before the attendant went his
rounds. Found him up and humming a tune. He was spreading out his sugar,
which he had saved, in the window, and was manifestly beginning his
fly-catching again; and beginning it cheerfully and with a good grace. I
looked around for his birds, and not seeing them, asked him where they
were. He replied, without turning round, that they had all flown away.
There were a few feathers about the room and on his pillow a drop of
blood. I said nothing, but went and told the keeper to report to me if
there were anything odd about him during the day.

11 a. m.—The attendant has just been to me to say that Renfield has
been very sick and has disgorged a whole lot of feathers. “My belief is,
doctor,” he said, “that he has eaten his birds, and that he just took
and ate them raw!”

11 p. m.—I gave Renfield a strong opiate to-night, enough to make
even him sleep, and took away his pocket-book to look at it. The thought
that has been buzzing about my brain lately is complete, and the theory
proved. My homicidal maniac is of a peculiar kind. I shall have to
invent a new classification for him, and call him a zoöphagous
(life-eating) maniac; what he desires is to absorb as many lives as he
can, and he has laid himself out to achieve it in a cumulative way. He
gave many flies to one spider and many spiders to one bird, and then
wanted a cat to eat the many birds. What would have been his later
steps? It would almost be worth while to complete the experiment. It
might be done if there were only a sufficient cause. Men sneered at
vivisection, and yet look at its results to-day! Why not advance science
in its most difficult and vital aspect—the knowledge of the brain? Had
I even the secret of one such mind—did I hold the key to the fancy of
even one lunatic—I might advance my own branch of science to a pitch
compared with which Burdon-Sanderson’s physiology or Ferrier’s
brain-knowledge would be as nothing. If only there were a sufficient
cause! I must not think too much of this, or I may be tempted; a good
cause might turn the scale with me, for may not I too be of an
exceptional brain, congenitally?
How well the man reasoned; lunatics always do within their own scope. I
wonder at how many lives he values a man, or if at only one. He has
closed the account most accurately, and to-day begun a new record. How
many of us begin a new record with each day of our lives?
To me it seems only yesterday that my whole life ended with my new hope,
and that truly I began a new record. So it will be until the Great
Recorder sums me up and closes my ledger account with a balance to
profit or loss. Oh, Lucy, Lucy, I cannot be angry with you, nor can I be
angry with my friend whose happiness is yours; but I must only wait on
hopeless and work. Work! work!
If I only could have as strong a cause as my poor mad friend there—a
good, unselfish cause to make me work—that would be indeed happiness.
Mina Murray’s Journal.
26 July.—I am anxious, and it soothes me to express myself here; it
is like whispering to one’s self and listening at the same time. And
there is also something about the shorthand symbols that makes it
different from writing. I am unhappy about Lucy and about Jonathan. I
had not heard from Jonathan for some time, and was very concerned; but
yesterday dear Mr. Hawkins, who is always so kind, sent me a letter from
him. I had written asking him if he had heard, and he said the enclosed
had just been received. It is only a line dated from Castle Dracula,
and says that he is just starting for home. That is not like Jonathan;
I do not understand it, and it makes me uneasy. Then, too, Lucy,
although she is so well, has lately taken to her old habit of walking in
her sleep. Her mother has spoken to me about it, and we have decided
that I am to lock the door of our room every night. Mrs. Westenra has
got an idea that sleep-walkers always go out on roofs of houses and
along the edges of cliffs and then get suddenly wakened and fall over
with a despairing cry that echoes all over the place. Poor dear, she is
naturally anxious about Lucy, and she tells me that her husband, Lucy’s
father, had the same habit; that he would get up in the night and dress
himself and go out, if he were not stopped. Lucy is to be married in the
autumn, and she is already planning out her dresses and how her house is
to be arranged. I sympathise with her, for I do the same, only Jonathan
and I will start in life in a very simple way, and shall have to try to
make both ends meet. Mr. Holmwood—he is the Hon. Arthur Holmwood, only
son of Lord Godalming—is coming up here very shortly—as soon as he can
leave town, for his father is not very well, and I think dear Lucy is
counting the moments till he comes. She wants to take him up to the seat
on the churchyard cliff and show him the beauty of Whitby. I daresay it
is the waiting which disturbs her; she will be all right when he
arrives.

27 July.—No news from Jonathan. I am getting quite uneasy about him,
though why I should I do not know; but I do wish that he would write, if
it were only a single line. Lucy walks more than ever, and each night I
am awakened by her moving about the room. Fortunately, the weather is so
hot that she cannot get cold; but still the anxiety and the perpetually
being wakened is beginning to tell on me, and I am getting nervous and
wakeful myself. Thank God, Lucy’s health keeps up. Mr. Holmwood has been
suddenly called to Ring to see his father, who has been taken seriously
ill. Lucy frets at the postponement of seeing him, but it does not touch
her looks; she is a trifle stouter, and her cheeks are a lovely
rose-pink. She has lost that anæmic look which she had. I pray it will
all last.

3 August.—Another week gone, and no news from Jonathan, not even to
Mr. Hawkins, from whom I have heard. Oh, I do hope he is not ill. He
surely would have written. I look at that last letter of his, but
somehow it does not satisfy me. It does not read like him, and yet it is
his writing. There is no mistake of that. Lucy has not walked much in
her sleep the last week, but there is an odd concentration about her
which I do not understand; even in her sleep she seems to be watching
me. She tries the door, and finding it locked, goes about the room
searching for the key.
6 August.—Another three days, and no news. This suspense is getting
dreadful. If I only knew where to write to or where to go to, I should
feel easier; but no one has heard a word of Jonathan since that last
letter. I must only pray to God for patience. Lucy is more excitable
than ever, but is otherwise well. Last night was very threatening, and
the fishermen say that we are in for a storm. I must try to watch it and
learn the weather signs. To-day is a grey day, and the sun as I write is
hidden in thick clouds, high over Kettleness. Everything is grey—except
the green grass, which seems like emerald amongst it; grey earthy rock;
grey clouds, tinged with the sunburst at the far edge, hang over the
grey sea, into which the sand-points stretch like grey fingers. The sea
is tumbling in over the shallows and the sandy flats with a roar,
muffled in the sea-mists drifting inland. The horizon is lost in a grey
mist. All is vastness; the clouds are piled up like giant rocks, and
there is a “brool” over the sea that sounds like some presage of doom.
Dark figures are on the beach here and there, sometimes half shrouded in
the mist, and seem “men like trees walking.” The fishing-boats are
racing for home, and rise and dip in the ground swell as they sweep into
the harbour, bending to the scuppers. Here comes old Mr. Swales. He is
making straight for me, and I can see, by the way he lifts his hat, that
he wants to talk....
I have been quite touched by the change in the poor old man. When he sat
down beside me, he said in a very gentle way:—
“I want to say something to you, miss.” I could see he was not at ease,
so I took his poor old wrinkled hand in mine and asked him to speak
fully; so he said, leaving his hand in mine:—
“I’m afraid, my deary, that I must have shocked you by all the wicked
things I’ve been sayin’ about the dead, and such like, for weeks past;
but I didn’t mean them, and I want ye to remember that when I’m gone. We
aud folks that be daffled, and with one foot abaft the krok-hooal, don’t
altogether like to think of it, and we don’t want to feel scart of it;
an’ that’s why I’ve took to makin’ light of it, so that I’d cheer up my
own heart a bit. But, Lord love ye, miss, I ain’t afraid of dyin’, not a
bit; only I don’t want to die if I can help it. My time must be nigh at
hand now, for I be aud, and a hundred years is too much for any man to
expect; and I’m so nigh it that the Aud Man is already whettin’ his
scythe. Ye see, I can’t get out o’ the habit of caffin’ about it all at
once; the chafts will wag as they be used to. Some day soon the Angel of
Death will sound his trumpet for me. But don’t ye dooal an’ greet, my
deary!”—for he saw that I was crying—“if he should come this very
night I’d not refuse to answer his call. For life be, after all, only a
waitin’ for somethin’ else than what we’re doin’; and death be all that
we can rightly depend on. But I’m content, for it’s comin’ to me, my
deary, and comin’ quick. It may be comin’ while we be lookin’ and
wonderin’. Maybe it’s in that wind out over the sea that’s bringin’ with
it loss and wreck, and sore distress, and sad hearts. Look! look!” he
cried suddenly. “There’s something in that wind and in the hoast beyont
that sounds, and looks, and tastes, and smells like death. It’s in the
air; I feel it comin’. Lord, make me answer cheerful when my call
comes!” He held up his arms devoutly, and raised his hat. His mouth
moved as though he were praying. After a few minutes’ silence, he got
up, shook hands with me, and blessed me, and said good-bye, and hobbled
off. It all touched me, and upset me very much.
I was glad when the coastguard came along, with his spy-glass under his
arm. He stopped to talk with me, as he always does, but all the time
kept looking at a strange ship.
“I can’t make her out,” he said; “she’s a Russian, by the look of her;
but she’s knocking about in the queerest way. She doesn’t know her mind
a bit; she seems to see the storm coming, but can’t decide whether to
run up north in the open, or to put in here. Look there again! She is
steered mighty strangely, for she doesn’t mind the hand on the wheel;
changes about with every puff of wind. We’ll hear more of her before
this time to-morrow.”

From a Correspondent.
Whitby.
ONE of the greatest and suddenest storms on record has just been
experienced here, with results both strange and unique. The weather had
been somewhat sultry, but not to any degree uncommon in the month of
August. Saturday evening was as fine as was ever known, and the great
body of holiday-makers laid out yesterday for visits to Mulgrave Woods,
Robin Hood’s Bay, Rig Mill, Runswick, Staithes, and the various trips in
the neighbourhood of Whitby. The steamers Emma and Scarborough made
trips up and down the coast, and there was an unusual amount of
“tripping” both to and from Whitby. The day was unusually fine till the
afternoon, when some of the gossips who frequent the East Cliff
churchyard, and from that commanding eminence watch the wide sweep of
sea visible to the north and east, called attention to a sudden show of
“mares’-tails” high in the sky to the north-west. The wind was then
blowing from the south-west in the mild degree which in barometrical
language is ranked “No. 2: light breeze.” The coastguard on duty at once
made report, and one old fisherman, who for more than half a century has
kept watch on weather signs from the East Cliff, foretold in an emphatic
manner the coming of a sudden storm. The approach of sunset was so very
beautiful, so grand in its masses of splendidly-coloured clouds, that
there was quite an assemblage on the walk along the cliff in the old
churchyard to enjoy the beauty. Before the sun dipped below the black
mass of Kettleness, standing boldly athwart the western sky, its
downward way was marked by myriad clouds of every sunset-colour—flame,
purple, pink, green, violet, and all the tints of gold; with here and
there masses not large, but of seemingly absolute blackness, in all
sorts of shapes, as well outlined as colossal silhouettes. The
experience was not lost on the painters, and doubtless some of the
sketches of the “Prelude to the Great Storm” will grace the R. A. and R.
I. walls in May next. More than one captain made up his mind then and
there that his “cobble” or his “mule,” as they term the different
classes of boats, would remain in the harbour till the storm had passed.
The wind fell away entirely during the evening, and at midnight there
was a dead calm, a sultry heat, and that prevailing intensity which, on
the approach of thunder, affects persons of a sensitive nature. There
were but few lights in sight at sea, for even the coasting steamers,
which usually “hug” the shore so closely, kept well to seaward, and but
few fishing-boats were in sight. The only sail noticeable was a foreign
schooner with all sails set, which was seemingly going westwards. The
foolhardiness or ignorance of her officers was a prolific theme for
comment whilst she remained in sight, and efforts were made to signal
her to reduce sail in face of her danger. Before the night shut down she
was seen with sails idly flapping as she gently rolled on the undulating
swell of the sea,
Shortly before ten o’clock the stillness of the air grew quite
oppressive, and the silence was so marked that the bleating of a sheep
inland or the barking of a dog in the town was distinctly heard, and the
band on the pier, with its lively French air, was like a discord in the
great harmony of nature’s silence. A little after midnight came a
strange sound from over the sea, and high overhead the air began to
carry a strange, faint, hollow booming.
Then without warning the tempest broke. With a rapidity which, at the
time, seemed incredible, and even afterwards is impossible to realize,
the whole aspect of nature at once became convulsed. The waves rose in
growing fury, each overtopping its fellow, till in a very few minutes
the lately glassy sea was like a roaring and devouring monster.
White-crested waves beat madly on the level sands and rushed up the
shelving cliffs; others broke over the piers, and with their spume swept
the lanthorns of the lighthouses which rise from the end of either pier
of Whitby Harbour. The wind roared like thunder, and blew with such
force that it was with difficulty that even strong men kept their feet,
or clung with grim clasp to the iron stanchions. It was found necessary
to clear the entire piers from the mass of onlookers, or else the
fatalities of the night would have been increased manifold. To add to
the difficulties and dangers of the time, masses of sea-fog came
drifting inland—white, wet clouds, which swept by in ghostly fashion,
so dank and damp and cold that it needed but little effort of
imagination to think that the spirits of those lost at sea were
touching their living brethren with the clammy hands of death, and many
a one shuddered as the wreaths of sea-mist swept by. At times the mist
cleared, and the sea for some distance could be seen in the glare of the
lightning, which now came thick and fast, followed by such sudden peals
of thunder that the whole sky overhead seemed trembling under the shock
of the footsteps of the storm.
Some of the scenes thus revealed were of immeasurable grandeur and of
absorbing interest—the sea, running mountains high, threw skywards with
each wave mighty masses of white foam, which the tempest seemed to
snatch at and whirl away into space; here and there a fishing-boat, with
a rag of sail, running madly for shelter before the blast; now and again
the white wings of a storm-tossed sea-bird. On the summit of the East
Cliff the new searchlight was ready for experiment, but had not yet been
tried. The officers in charge of it got it into working order, and in
the pauses of the inrushing mist swept with it the surface of the sea.
Once or twice its service was most effective, as when a fishing-boat,
with gunwale under water, rushed into the harbour, able, by the guidance
of the sheltering light, to avoid the danger of dashing against the
piers. As each boat achieved the safety of the port there was a shout of
joy from the mass of people on shore, a shout which for a moment seemed
to cleave the gale and was then swept away in its rush.
Before long the searchlight discovered some distance away a schooner
with all sails set, apparently the same vessel which had been noticed
earlier in the evening. The wind had by this time backed to the east,
and there was a shudder amongst the watchers on the cliff as they
realized the terrible danger in which she now was. Between her and the
port lay the great flat reef on which so many good ships have from time
to time suffered, and, with the wind blowing from its present quarter,
it would be quite impossible that she should fetch the entrance of the
harbour. It was now nearly the hour of high tide, but the waves were so
great that in their troughs the shallows of the shore were almost
visible, and the schooner, with all sails set, was rushing with such
speed that, in the words of one old salt, “she must fetch up somewhere,
if it was only in hell.” Then came another rush of sea-fog, greater than
any hitherto—a mass of dank mist, which seemed to close on all things
like a grey pall, and left available to men only the organ of hearing,
for the roar of the tempest, and the crash of the thunder, and the
booming of the mighty billows came through the damp oblivion even louder
than before. The rays of the searchlight were kept fixed on the harbour
mouth across the East Pier, where the shock was expected, and men waited
breathless. The wind suddenly shifted to the north-east, and the remnant
of the sea-fog melted in the blast; and then, mirabile dictu, between
the piers, leaping from wave to wave as it rushed at headlong speed,
swept the strange schooner before the blast, with all sail set, and
gained the safety of the harbour. The searchlight followed her, and a
shudder ran through all who saw her, for lashed to the helm was a
corpse, with drooping head, which swung horribly to and fro at each
motion of the ship. No other form could be seen on deck at all. A great
awe came on all as they realised that the ship, as if by a miracle, had
found the harbour, unsteered save by the hand of a dead man! However,
all took place more quickly than it takes to write these words. The
schooner paused not, but rushing across the harbour, pitched herself on
that accumulation of sand and gravel washed by many tides and many
storms into the south-east corner of the pier jutting under the East
Cliff, known locally as Tate Hill Pier.
There was of course a considerable concussion as the vessel drove up on
the sand heap. Every spar, rope, and stay was strained, and some of the
“top-hammer” came crashing down. But, strangest of all, the very instant
the shore was touched, an immense dog sprang up on deck from below, as
if shot up by the concussion, and running forward, jumped from the bow
on the sand. Making straight for the steep cliff, where the churchyard
hangs over the laneway to the East Pier so steeply that some of the flat
tombstones—“thruff-steans” or “through-stones,” as they call them in
the Whitby vernacular—actually project over where the sustaining cliff
has fallen away, it disappeared in the darkness, which seemed
intensified just beyond the focus of the searchlight.
It so happened that there was no one at the moment on Tate Hill Pier, as
all those whose houses are in close proximity were either in bed or were
out on the heights above. Thus the coastguard on duty on the eastern
side of the harbour, who at once ran down to the little pier, was the
first to climb on board. The men working the searchlight, after scouring
the entrance of the harbour without seeing anything, then turned the
light on the derelict and kept it there. The coastguard ran aft, and
when he came beside the wheel, bent over to examine it, and recoiled at
once as though under some sudden emotion. This seemed to pique general
curiosity, and quite a number of people began to run. It is a good way
round from the West Cliff by the Drawbridge to Tate Hill Pier, but your
correspondent is a fairly good runner, and came well ahead of the crowd.
When I arrived, however, I found already assembled on the pier a crowd,
whom the coastguard and police refused to allow to come on board. By the
courtesy of the chief boatman, I was, as your correspondent, permitted
to climb on deck, and was one of a small group who saw the dead seaman
whilst actually lashed to the wheel.
It was no wonder that the coastguard was surprised, or even awed, for
not often can such a sight have been seen. The man was simply fastened
by his hands, tied one over the other, to a spoke of the wheel. Between
the inner hand and the wood was a crucifix, the set of beads on which it
was fastened being around both wrists and wheel, and all kept fast by
the binding cords. The poor fellow may have been seated at one time, but
the flapping and buffeting of the sails had worked through the rudder of
the wheel and dragged him to and fro, so that the cords with which he
was tied had cut the flesh to the bone. Accurate note was made of the
state of things, and a doctor—Surgeon J. M. Caffyn, of 33, East Elliot
Place—who came immediately after me, declared, after making
examination, that the man must have been dead for quite two days. In his
pocket was a bottle, carefully corked, empty save for a little roll of
paper, which proved to be the addendum to the log. The coastguard said
the man must have tied up his own hands, fastening the knots with his
teeth. The fact that a coastguard was the first on board may save some
complications, later on, in the Admiralty Court; for coastguards cannot
claim the salvage which is the right of the first civilian entering on a
derelict. Already, however, the legal tongues are wagging, and one young
law student is loudly asserting that the rights of the owner are already
completely sacrificed, his property being held in contravention of the
statutes of mortmain, since the tiller, as emblemship, if not proof, of
delegated possession, is held in a dead hand. It is needless to say
that the dead steersman has been reverently removed from the place where
he held his honourable watch and ward till death—a steadfastness as
noble as that of the young Casabianca—and placed in the mortuary to
await inquest.
Already the sudden storm is passing, and its fierceness is abating;
crowds are scattering homeward, and the sky is beginning to redden over
the Yorkshire wolds. I shall send, in time for your next issue, further
details of the derelict ship which found her way so miraculously into
harbour in the storm.
Whitby
9 August.—The sequel to the strange arrival of the derelict in the
storm last night is almost more startling than the thing itself. It
turns out that the schooner is a Russian from Varna, and is called the
Demeter. She is almost entirely in ballast of silver sand, with only a
small amount of cargo—a number of great wooden boxes filled with mould.
This cargo was consigned to a Whitby solicitor, Mr. S. F. Billington, of
7, The Crescent, who this morning went aboard and formally took
possession of the goods consigned to him. The Russian consul, too,
acting for the charter-party, took formal possession of the ship, and
paid all harbour dues, etc. Nothing is talked about here to-day except
the strange coincidence; the officials of the Board of Trade have been
most exacting in seeing that every compliance has been made with
existing regulations. As the matter is to be a “nine days’ wonder,” they
are evidently determined that there shall be no cause of after
complaint. A good deal of interest was abroad concerning the dog which
landed when the ship struck, and more than a few of the members of the
S. P. C. A., which is very strong in Whitby, have tried to befriend the
animal. To the general disappointment, however, it was not to be found;
it seems to have disappeared entirely from the town. It may be that it
was frightened and made its way on to the moors, where it is still
hiding in terror. There are some who look with dread on such a
possibility, lest later on it should in itself become a danger, for it
is evidently a fierce brute. Early this morning a large dog, a half-bred
mastiff belonging to a coal merchant close to Tate Hill Pier, was found
dead in the roadway opposite to its master’s yard. It had been fighting,
and manifestly had had a savage opponent, for its throat was torn away,
and its belly was slit open as if with a savage claw.

Later.—By the kindness of the Board of Trade inspector, I have been
permitted to look over the log-book of the Demeter, which was in order
up to within three days, but contained nothing of special interest
except as to facts of missing men. The greatest interest, however, is
with regard to the paper found in the bottle, which was to-day produced
at the inquest; and a more strange narrative than the two between them
unfold it has not been my lot to come across. As there is no motive for
concealment, I am permitted to use them, and accordingly send you a
rescript, simply omitting technical details of seamanship and
supercargo. It almost seems as though the captain had been seized with
some kind of mania before he had got well into blue water, and that
this had developed persistently throughout the voyage. Of course my
statement must be taken cum grano, since I am writing from the
dictation of a clerk of the Russian consul, who kindly translated for
me, time being short.
LOG OF THE “DEMETER.”
Varna to Whitby.
Written 18 July, things so strange happening, that I shall keep
accurate note henceforth till we land.

On 6 July we finished taking in cargo, silver sand and boxes of earth.
At noon set sail. East wind, fresh. Crew, five hands ... two mates,
cook, and myself (captain).

On 11 July at dawn entered Bosphorus. Boarded by Turkish Customs
officers. Backsheesh. All correct. Under way at 4 p. m.

On 12 July through Dardanelles. More Customs officers and flagboat of
guarding squadron. Backsheesh again. Work of officers thorough, but
quick. Want us off soon. At dark passed into Archipelago.

On 13 July passed Cape Matapan. Crew dissatisfied about something.
Seemed scared, but would not speak out.

On 14 July was somewhat anxious about crew. Men all steady fellows, who
sailed with me before. Mate could not make out what was wrong; they only
told him there was something, and crossed themselves. Mate lost temper
with one of them that day and struck him. Expected fierce quarrel, but
all was quiet.

On 16 July mate reported in the morning that one of crew, Petrofsky, was
missing. Could not account for it. Took larboard watch eight bells last
night; was relieved by Abramoff, but did not go to bunk. Men more
downcast than ever. All said they expected something of the kind, but
would not say more than there was something aboard. Mate getting very
impatient with them; feared some trouble ahead.

On 17 July, yesterday, one of the men, Olgaren, came to my cabin, and in
an awestruck way confided to me that he thought there was a strange man
aboard the ship. He said that in his watch he had been sheltering
behind the deck-house, as there was a rain-storm, when he saw a tall,
thin man, who was not like any of the crew, come up the companion-way,
and go along the deck forward, and disappear. He followed cautiously,
but when he got to bows found no one, and the hatchways were all closed.
He was in a panic of superstitious fear, and I am afraid the panic may
spread. To allay it, I shall to-day search entire ship carefully from
stem to stern.

Later in the day I got together the whole crew, and told them, as they
evidently thought there was some one in the ship, we would search from
stem to stern. First mate angry; said it was folly, and to yield to such
foolish ideas would demoralise the men; said he would engage to keep
them out of trouble with a handspike. I let him take the helm, while the
rest began thorough search, all keeping abreast, with lanterns: we left
no corner unsearched. As there were only the big wooden boxes, there
were no odd corners where a man could hide. Men much relieved when
search over, and went back to work cheerfully. First mate scowled, but
said nothing.

22 July.—Rough weather last three days, and all hands busy with
sails—no time to be frightened. Men seem to have forgotten their dread.
Mate cheerful again, and all on good terms. Praised men for work in bad
weather. Passed Gibralter and out through Straits. All well.

24 July.—There seems some doom over this ship. Already a hand short,
and entering on the Bay of Biscay with wild weather ahead, and yet last
night another man lost—disappeared. Like the first, he came off his
watch and was not seen again. Men all in a panic of fear; sent a round
robin, asking to have double watch, as they fear to be alone. Mate
angry. Fear there will be some trouble, as either he or the men will do
some violence.

28 July.—Four days in hell, knocking about in a sort of maelstrom,
and the wind a tempest. No sleep for any one. Men all worn out. Hardly
know how to set a watch, since no one fit to go on. Second mate
volunteered to steer and watch, and let men snatch a few hours’ sleep.
Wind abating; seas still terrific, but feel them less, as ship is
steadier.

29 July.—Another tragedy. Had single watch to-night, as crew too
tired to double. When morning watch came on deck could find no one
except steersman. Raised outcry, and all came on deck. Thorough search,
but no one found. Are now without second mate, and crew in a panic. Mate
and I agreed to go armed henceforth and wait for any sign of cause.

30 July.—Last night. Rejoiced we are nearing England. Weather fine,
all sails set. Retired worn out; slept soundly; awaked by mate telling
me that both man of watch and steersman missing. Only self and mate and
two hands left to work ship.

1 August.—Two days of fog, and not a sail sighted. Had hoped when in
the English Channel to be able to signal for help or get in somewhere.
Not having power to work sails, have to run before wind. Dare not lower,
as could not raise them again. We seem to be drifting to some terrible
doom. Mate now more demoralised than either of men. His stronger nature
seems to have worked inwardly against himself. Men are beyond fear,
working stolidly and patiently, with minds made up to worst. They are
Russian, he Roumanian.

2 August, midnight.—Woke up from few minutes’ sleep by hearing a cry,
seemingly outside my port. Could see nothing in fog. Rushed on deck, and
ran against mate. Tells me heard cry and ran, but no sign of man on
watch. One more gone. Lord, help us! Mate says we must be past Straits
of Dover, as in a moment of fog lifting he saw North Foreland, just as
he heard the man cry out. If so we are now off in the North Sea, and
only God can guide us in the fog, which seems to move with us; and God
seems to have deserted us.

3 August.—At midnight I went to relieve the man at the wheel, and
when I got to it found no one there. The wind was steady, and as we ran
before it there was no yawing. I dared not leave it, so shouted for the
mate. After a few seconds he rushed up on deck in his flannels. He
looked wild-eyed and haggard, and I greatly fear his reason has given
way. He came close to me and whispered hoarsely, with his mouth to my
ear, as though fearing the very air might hear: “It is here; I know
it, now. On the watch last night I saw It, like a man, tall and thin,
and ghastly pale. It was in the bows, and looking out. I crept behind
It, and gave It my knife; but the knife went through It, empty as the
air.” And as he spoke he took his knife and drove it savagely into
space. Then he went on: “But It is here, and I’ll find It. It is in the
hold, perhaps in one of those boxes. I’ll unscrew them one by one and
see. You work the helm.” And, with a warning look and his finger on his
lip, he went below. There was springing up a choppy wind, and I could
not leave the helm. I saw him come out on deck again with a tool-chest
and a lantern, and go down the forward hatchway. He is mad, stark,
raving mad, and it’s no use my trying to stop him. He can’t hurt those
big boxes: they are invoiced as “clay,” and to pull them about is as
harmless a thing as he can do. So here I stay, and mind the helm, and
write these notes. I can only trust in God and wait till the fog clears.
Then, if I can’t steer to any harbour with the wind that is, I shall cut
down sails and lie by, and signal for help....

It is nearly all over now. Just as I was beginning to hope that the mate
would come out calmer—for I heard him knocking away at something in the
hold, and work is good for him—there came up the hatchway a sudden,
startled scream, which made my blood run cold, and up on the deck he
came as if shot from a gun—a raging madman, with his eyes rolling and
his face convulsed with fear. “Save me! save me!” he cried, and then
looked round on the blanket of fog. His horror turned to despair, and in
a steady voice he said: “You had better come too, captain, before it is
too late. He is there. I know the secret now. The sea will save me
from Him, and it is all that is left!” Before I could say a word, or
move forward to seize him, he sprang on the bulwark and deliberately
threw himself into the sea. I suppose I know the secret too, now. It was
this madman who had got rid of the men one by one, and now he has
followed them himself. God help me! How am I to account for all these
horrors when I get to port? When I get to port! Will that ever be?

4 August.—Still fog, which the sunrise cannot pierce. I know there is
sunrise because I am a sailor, why else I know not. I dared not go
below, I dared not leave the helm; so here all night I stayed, and in
the dimness of the night I saw It—Him! God forgive me, but the mate was
right to jump overboard. It was better to die like a man; to die like a
sailor in blue water no man can object. But I am captain, and I must not
leave my ship. But I shall baffle this fiend or monster, for I shall tie
my hands to the wheel when my strength begins to fail, and along with
them I shall tie that which He—It!—dare not touch; and then, come good
wind or foul, I shall save my soul, and my honour as a captain. I am
growing weaker, and the night is coming on. If He can look me in the
face again, I may not have time to act.... If we are wrecked, mayhap
this bottle may be found, and those who find it may understand; if not,
... well, then all men shall know that I have been true to my trust. God
and the Blessed Virgin and the saints help a poor ignorant soul trying
to do his duty....

Of course the verdict was an open one. There is no evidence to adduce;
and whether or not the man himself committed the murders there is now
none to say. The folk here hold almost universally that the captain is
simply a hero, and he is to be given a public funeral. Already it is
arranged that his body is to be taken with a train of boats up the Esk
for a piece and then brought back to Tate Hill Pier and up the abbey
steps; for he is to be buried in the churchyard on the cliff. The owners
of more than a hundred boats have already given in their names as
wishing to follow him to the grave.
No trace has ever been found of the great dog; at which there is much
mourning, for, with public opinion in its present state, he would, I
believe, be adopted by the town. To-morrow will see the funeral; and so
will end this one more “mystery of the sea.”
Mina Murray’s Journal.
8 August.—Lucy was very restless all night, and I, too, could not
sleep. The storm was fearful, and as it boomed loudly among the
chimney-pots, it made me shudder. When a sharp puff came it seemed to be
like a distant gun. Strangely enough, Lucy did not wake; but she got up
twice and dressed herself. Fortunately, each time I awoke in time and
managed to undress her without waking her, and got her back to bed. It
is a very strange thing, this sleep-walking, for as soon as her will is
thwarted in any physical way, her intention, if there be any,
disappears, and she yields herself almost exactly to the routine of her
life.
Early in the morning we both got up and went down to the harbour to see
if anything had happened in the night. There were very few people about,
and though the sun was bright, and the air clear and fresh, the big,
grim-looking waves, that seemed dark themselves because the foam that
topped them was like snow, forced themselves in through the narrow mouth
of the harbour—like a bullying man going through a crowd. Somehow I
felt glad that Jonathan was not on the sea last night, but on land. But,
oh, is he on land or sea? Where is he, and how? I am getting fearfully
anxious about him. If I only knew what to do, and could do anything!

10 August.—The funeral of the poor sea-captain to-day was most
touching. Every boat in the harbour seemed to be there, and the coffin
was carried by captains all the way from Tate Hill Pier up to the
churchyard. Lucy came with me, and we went early to our old seat, whilst
the cortège of boats went up the river to the Viaduct and came down
again. We had a lovely view, and saw the procession nearly all the way.
The poor fellow was laid to rest quite near our seat so that we stood on
it when the time came and saw everything. Poor Lucy seemed much upset.
She was restless and uneasy all the time, and I cannot but think that
her dreaming at night is telling on her. She is quite odd in one thing:
she will not admit to me that there is any cause for restlessness; or if
there be, she does not understand it herself. There is an additional
cause in that poor old Mr. Swales was found dead this morning on our
seat, his neck being broken. He had evidently, as the doctor said,
fallen back in the seat in some sort of fright, for there was a look of
fear and horror on his face that the men said made them shudder. Poor
dear old man! Perhaps he had seen Death with his dying eyes! Lucy is so
sweet and sensitive that she feels influences more acutely than other
people do. Just now she was quite upset by a little thing which I did
not much heed, though I am myself very fond of animals. One of the men
who came up here often to look for the boats was followed by his dog.
The dog is always with him. They are both quiet persons, and I never saw
the man angry, nor heard the dog bark. During the service the dog would
not come to its master, who was on the seat with us, but kept a few
yards off, barking and howling. Its master spoke to it gently, and then
harshly, and then angrily; but it would neither come nor cease to make a
noise. It was in a sort of fury, with its eyes savage, and all its hairs
bristling out like a cat’s tail when puss is on the war-path. Finally
the man, too, got angry, and jumped down and kicked the dog, and then
took it by the scruff of the neck and half dragged and half threw it on
the tombstone on which the seat is fixed. The moment it touched the
stone the poor thing became quiet and fell all into a tremble. It did
not try to get away, but crouched down, quivering and cowering, and was
in such a pitiable state of terror that I tried, though without effect,
to comfort it. Lucy was full of pity, too, but she did not attempt to
touch the dog, but looked at it in an agonised sort of way. I greatly
fear that she is of too super-sensitive a nature to go through the world
without trouble. She will be dreaming of this to-night, I am sure. The
whole agglomeration of things—the ship steered into port by a dead
man; his attitude, tied to the wheel with a crucifix and beads; the
touching funeral; the dog, now furious and now in terror—will all
afford material for her dreams.
I think it will be best for her to go to bed tired out physically, so I
shall take her for a long walk by the cliffs to Robin Hood’s Bay and
back. She ought not to have much inclination for sleep-walking then.
Same day, 11 o’clock p. m.—Oh, but I am tired! If it were not that I
had made my diary a duty I should not open it to-night. We had a lovely
walk. Lucy, after a while, was in gay spirits, owing, I think, to some
dear cows who came nosing towards us in a field close to the lighthouse,
and frightened the wits out of us. I believe we forgot everything
except, of course, personal fear, and it seemed to wipe the slate clean
and give us a fresh start. We had a capital “severe tea” at Robin Hood’s
Bay in a sweet little old-fashioned inn, with a bow-window right over
the seaweed-covered rocks of the strand. I believe we should have
shocked the “New Woman” with our appetites. Men are more tolerant, bless
them! Then we walked home with some, or rather many, stoppages to rest,
and with our hearts full of a constant dread of wild bulls. Lucy was
really tired, and we intended to creep off to bed as soon as we could.
The young curate came in, however, and Mrs. Westenra asked him to stay
for supper. Lucy and I had both a fight for it with the dusty miller; I
know it was a hard fight on my part, and I am quite heroic. I think that
some day the bishops must get together and see about breeding up a new
class of curates, who don’t take supper, no matter how they may be
pressed to, and who will know when girls are tired. Lucy is asleep and
breathing softly. She has more colour in her cheeks than usual, and
looks, oh, so sweet. If Mr. Holmwood fell in love with her seeing her
only in the drawing-room, I wonder what he would say if he saw her now.
Some of the “New Women” writers will some day start an idea that men and
women should be allowed to see each other asleep before proposing or
accepting. But I suppose the New Woman won’t condescend in future to
accept; she will do the proposing herself. And a nice job she will make
of it, too! There’s some consolation in that. I am so happy to-night,
because dear Lucy seems better. I really believe she has turned the
corner, and that we are over her troubles with dreaming. I should be
quite happy if I only knew if Jonathan.... God bless and keep him.

11 August, 3 a. m.—Diary again. No sleep now, so I may as well write.
I am too agitated to sleep. We have had such an adventure, such an
agonising experience. I fell asleep as soon as I had closed my diary....
Suddenly I became broad awake, and sat up, with a horrible sense of fear
upon me, and of some feeling of emptiness around me. The room was dark,
so I could not see Lucy’s bed; I stole across and felt for her. The bed
was empty. I lit a match and found that she was not in the room. The
door was shut, but not locked, as I had left it. I feared to wake her
mother, who has been more than usually ill lately, so threw on some
clothes and got ready to look for her. As I was leaving the room it
struck me that the clothes she wore might give me some clue to her
dreaming intention. Dressing-gown would mean house; dress, outside.
Dressing-gown and dress were both in their places. “Thank God,” I said
to myself, “she cannot be far, as she is only in her nightdress.” I ran
downstairs and looked in the sitting-room. Not there! Then I looked in
all the other open rooms of the house, with an ever-growing fear
chilling my heart. Finally I came to the hall door and found it open. It
was not wide open, but the catch of the lock had not caught. The people
of the house are careful to lock the door every night, so I feared that
Lucy must have gone out as she was. There was no time to think of what
might happen; a vague, overmastering fear obscured all details. I took a
big, heavy shawl and ran out. The clock was striking one as I was in the
Crescent, and there was not a soul in sight. I ran along the North
Terrace, but could see no sign of the white figure which I expected. At
the edge of the West Cliff above the pier I looked across the harbour to
the East Cliff, in the hope or fear—I don’t know which—of seeing Lucy
in our favourite seat. There was a bright full moon, with heavy black,
driving clouds, which threw the whole scene into a fleeting diorama of
light and shade as they sailed across. For a moment or two I could see
nothing, as the shadow of a cloud obscured St. Mary’s Church and all
around it. Then as the cloud passed I could see the ruins of the abbey
coming into view; and as the edge of a narrow band of light as sharp as
a sword-cut moved along, the church and the churchyard became gradually
visible. Whatever my expectation was, it was not disappointed, for
there, on our favourite seat, the silver light of the moon struck a
half-reclining figure, snowy white. The coming of the cloud was too
quick for me to see much, for shadow shut down on light almost
immediately; but it seemed to me as though something dark stood behind
the seat where the white figure shone, and bent over it. What it was,
whether man or beast, I could not tell; I did not wait to catch another
glance, but flew down the steep steps to the pier and along by the
fish-market to the bridge, which was the only way to reach the East
Cliff. The town seemed as dead, for not a soul did I see; I rejoiced
that it was so, for I wanted no witness of poor Lucy’s condition. The
time and distance seemed endless, and my knees trembled and my breath
came laboured as I toiled up the endless steps to the abbey. I must have
gone fast, and yet it seemed to me as if my feet were weighted with
lead, and as though every joint in my body were rusty. When I got almost
to the top I could see the seat and the white figure, for I was now
close enough to distinguish it even through the spells of shadow. There
was undoubtedly something, long and black, bending over the
half-reclining white figure. I called in fright, “Lucy! Lucy!” and
something raised a head, and from where I was I could see a white face
and red, gleaming eyes. Lucy did not answer, and I ran on to the
entrance of the churchyard. As I entered, the church was between me and
the seat, and for a minute or so I lost sight of her. When I came in
view again the cloud had passed, and the moonlight struck so brilliantly
that I could see Lucy half reclining with her head lying over the back
of the seat. She was quite alone, and there was not a sign of any living
thing about.
When I bent over her I could see that she was still asleep. Her lips
were parted, and she was breathing—not softly as usual with her, but in
long, heavy gasps, as though striving to get her lungs full at every
breath. As I came close, she put up her hand in her sleep and pulled the
collar of her nightdress close around her throat. Whilst she did so
there came a little shudder through her, as though she felt the cold. I
flung the warm shawl over her, and drew the edges tight round her neck,
for I dreaded lest she should get some deadly chill from the night air,
unclad as she was. I feared to wake her all at once, so, in order to
have my hands free that I might help her, I fastened the shawl at her
throat with a big safety-pin; but I must have been clumsy in my anxiety
and pinched or pricked her with it, for by-and-by, when her breathing
became quieter, she put her hand to her throat again and moaned. When I
had her carefully wrapped up I put my shoes on her feet and then began
very gently to wake her. At first she did not respond; but gradually she
became more and more uneasy in her sleep, moaning and sighing
occasionally. At last, as time was passing fast, and, for many other
reasons, I wished to get her home at once, I shook her more forcibly,
till finally she opened her eyes and awoke. She did not seem surprised
to see me, as, of course, she did not realise all at once where she was.
Lucy always wakes prettily, and even at such a time, when her body must
have been chilled with cold, and her mind somewhat appalled at waking
unclad in a churchyard at night, she did not lose her grace. She
trembled a little, and clung to me; when I told her to come at once with
me home she rose without a word, with the obedience of a child. As we
passed along, the gravel hurt my feet, and Lucy noticed me wince. She
stopped and wanted to insist upon my taking my shoes; but I would not.
However, when we got to the pathway outside the churchyard, where there
was a puddle of water, remaining from the storm, I daubed my feet with
mud, using each foot in turn on the other, so that as we went home, no
one, in case we should meet any one, should notice my bare feet.
Fortune favoured us, and we got home without meeting a soul. Once we saw
a man, who seemed not quite sober, passing along a street in front of
us; but we hid in a door till he had disappeared up an opening such as
there are here, steep little closes, or “wynds,” as they call them in
Scotland. My heart beat so loud all the time that sometimes I thought I
should faint. I was filled with anxiety about Lucy, not only for her
health, lest she should suffer from the exposure, but for her reputation
in case the story should get wind. When we got in, and had washed our
feet, and had said a prayer of thankfulness together, I tucked her into
bed. Before falling asleep she asked—even implored—me not to say a
word to any one, even her mother, about her sleep-walking adventure. I
hesitated at first to promise; but on thinking of the state of her
mother’s health, and how the knowledge of such a thing would fret her,
and thinking, too, of how such a story might become distorted—nay,
infallibly would—in case it should leak out, I thought it wiser to do
so. I hope I did right. I have locked the door, and the key is tied to
my wrist, so perhaps I shall not be again disturbed. Lucy is sleeping
soundly; the reflex of the dawn is high and far over the sea....

Same day, noon.—All goes well. Lucy slept till I woke her and seemed
not to have even changed her side. The adventure of the night does not
seem to have harmed her; on the contrary, it has benefited her, for she
looks better this morning than she has done for weeks. I was sorry to
notice that my clumsiness with the safety-pin hurt her. Indeed, it might
have been serious, for the skin of her throat was pierced. I must have
pinched up a piece of loose skin and have transfixed it, for there are
two little red points like pin-pricks, and on the band of her nightdress
was a drop of blood. When I apologised and was concerned about it, she
laughed and petted me, and said she did not even feel it. Fortunately it
cannot leave a scar, as it is so tiny.

Same day, night.—We passed a happy day. The air was clear, and the
sun bright, and there was a cool breeze. We took our lunch to Mulgrave
Woods, Mrs. Westenra driving by the road and Lucy and I walking by the
cliff-path and joining her at the gate. I felt a little sad myself, for
I could not but feel how absolutely happy it would have been had
Jonathan been with me. But there! I must only be patient. In the evening
we strolled in the Casino Terrace, and heard some good music by Spohr
and Mackenzie, and went to bed early. Lucy seems more restful than she
has been for some time, and fell asleep at once. I shall lock the door
and secure the key the same as before, though I do not expect any
trouble to-night.

12 August.—My expectations were wrong, for twice during the night I
was wakened by Lucy trying to get out. She seemed, even in her sleep, to
be a little impatient at finding the door shut, and went back to bed
under a sort of protest. I woke with the dawn, and heard the birds
chirping outside of the window. Lucy woke, too, and, I was glad to see,
was even better than on the previous morning. All her old gaiety of
manner seemed to have come back, and she came and snuggled in beside me
and told me all about Arthur. I told her how anxious I was about
Jonathan, and then she tried to comfort me. Well, she succeeded
somewhat, for, though sympathy can’t alter facts, it can help to make
them more bearable.

13 August.—Another quiet day, and to bed with the key on my wrist as
before. Again I awoke in the night, and found Lucy sitting up in bed,
still asleep, pointing to the window. I got up quietly, and pulling
aside the blind, looked out. It was brilliant moonlight, and the soft
effect of the light over the sea and sky—merged together in one great,
silent mystery—was beautiful beyond words. Between me and the moonlight
flitted a great bat, coming and going in great whirling circles. Once or
twice it came quite close, but was, I suppose, frightened at seeing me,
and flitted away across the harbour towards the abbey. When I came back
from the window Lucy had lain down again, and was sleeping peacefully.
She did not stir again all night.

14 August.—On the East Cliff, reading and writing all day. Lucy seems
to have become as much in love with the spot as I am, and it is hard to
get her away from it when it is time to come home for lunch or tea or
dinner. This afternoon she made a funny remark. We were coming home for
dinner, and had come to the top of the steps up from the West Pier and
stopped to look at the view, as we generally do. The setting sun, low
down in the sky, was just dropping behind Kettleness; the red light was
thrown over on the East Cliff and the old abbey, and seemed to bathe
everything in a beautiful rosy glow. We were silent for a while, and
suddenly Lucy murmured as if to herself:—
“His red eyes again! They are just the same.” It was such an odd
expression, coming apropos of nothing, that it quite startled me. I
slewed round a little, so as to see Lucy well without seeming to stare
at her, and saw that she was in a half-dreamy state, with an odd look on
her face that I could not quite make out; so I said nothing, but
followed her eyes. She appeared to be looking over at our own seat,
whereon was a dark figure seated alone. I was a little startled myself,
for it seemed for an instant as if the stranger had great eyes like
burning flames; but a second look dispelled the illusion. The red
sunlight was shining on the windows of St. Mary’s Church behind our
seat, and as the sun dipped there was just sufficient change in the
refraction and reflection to make it appear as if the light moved. I
called Lucy’s attention to the peculiar effect, and she became herself
with a start, but she looked sad all the same; it may have been that she
was thinking of that terrible night up there. We never refer to it; so I
said nothing, and we went home to dinner. Lucy had a headache and went
early to bed. I saw her asleep, and went out for a little stroll myself;
I walked along the cliffs to the westward, and was full of sweet
sadness, for I was thinking of Jonathan. When coming home—it was then
bright moonlight, so bright that, though the front of our part of the
Crescent was in shadow, everything could be well seen—I threw a glance
up at our window, and saw Lucy’s head leaning out. I thought that
perhaps she was looking out for me, so I opened my handkerchief and
waved it. She did not notice or make any movement whatever. Just then,
the moonlight crept round an angle of the building, and the light fell
on the window. There distinctly was Lucy with her head lying up against
the side of the window-sill and her eyes shut. She was fast asleep, and
by her, seated on the window-sill, was something that looked like a
good-sized bird. I was afraid she might get a chill, so I ran upstairs,
but as I came into the room she was moving back to her bed, fast
asleep, and breathing heavily; she was holding her hand to her throat,
as though to protect it from cold.
I did not wake her, but tucked her up warmly; I have taken care that the
door is locked and the window securely fastened.
She looks so sweet as she sleeps; but she is paler than is her wont, and
there is a drawn, haggard look under her eyes which I do not like. I
fear she is fretting about something. I wish I could find out what it
is.

15 August.—Rose later than usual. Lucy was languid and tired, and
slept on after we had been called. We had a happy surprise at breakfast.
Arthur’s father is better, and wants the marriage to come off soon. Lucy
is full of quiet joy, and her mother is glad and sorry at once. Later on
in the day she told me the cause. She is grieved to lose Lucy as her
very own, but she is rejoiced that she is soon to have some one to
protect her. Poor dear, sweet lady! She confided to me that she has got
her death-warrant. She has not told Lucy, and made me promise secrecy;
her doctor told her that within a few months, at most, she must die, for
her heart is weakening. At any time, even now, a sudden shock would be
almost sure to kill her. Ah, we were wise to keep from her the affair of
the dreadful night of Lucy’s sleep-walking.

17 August.—No diary for two whole days. I have not had the heart to
write. Some sort of shadowy pall seems to be coming over our happiness.
No news from Jonathan, and Lucy seems to be growing weaker, whilst her
mother’s hours are numbering to a close. I do not understand Lucy’s
fading away as she is doing. She eats well and sleeps well, and enjoys
the fresh air; but all the time the roses in her cheeks are fading, and
she gets weaker and more languid day by day; at night I hear her gasping
as if for air. I keep the key of our door always fastened to my wrist at
night, but she gets up and walks about the room, and sits at the open
window. Last night I found her leaning out when I woke up, and when I
tried to wake her I could not; she was in a faint. When I managed to
restore her she was as weak as water, and cried silently between long,
painful struggles for breath. When I asked her how she came to be at the
window she shook her head and turned away. I trust her feeling ill may
not be from that unlucky prick of the safety-pin. I looked at her throat
just now as she lay asleep, and the tiny wounds seem not to have healed.
They are still open, and, if anything, larger than before, and the
edges of them are faintly white. They are like little white dots with
red centres. Unless they heal within a day or two, I shall insist on the
doctor seeing about them.

Mina Murray’s Journal.
18 August.—I am happy to-day, and write sitting on the seat in the
churchyard. Lucy is ever so much better. Last night she slept well all
night, and did not disturb me once. The roses seem coming back already
to her cheeks, though she is still sadly pale and wan-looking. If she
were in any way anæmic I could understand it, but she is not. She is in
gay spirits and full of life and cheerfulness. All the morbid reticence
seems to have passed from her, and she has just reminded me, as if I
needed any reminding, of that night, and that it was here, on this
very seat, I found her asleep. As she told me she tapped playfully with
the heel of her boot on the stone slab and said:—
“My poor little feet didn’t make much noise then! I daresay poor old Mr.
Swales would have told me that it was because I didn’t want to wake up
Geordie.” As she was in such a communicative humour, I asked her if she
had dreamed at all that night. Before she answered, that sweet, puckered
look came into her forehead, which Arthur—I call him Arthur from her
habit—says he loves; and, indeed, I don’t wonder that he does. Then she
went on in a half-dreaming kind of way, as if trying to recall it to
herself:—
“I didn’t quite dream; but it all seemed to be real. I only wanted to be
here in this spot—I don’t know why, for I was afraid of something—I
don’t know what. I remember, though I suppose I was asleep, passing
through the streets and over the bridge. A fish leaped as I went by, and
I leaned over to look at it, and I heard a lot of dogs howling—the
whole town seemed as if it must be full of dogs all howling at once—as
I went up the steps. Then I had a vague memory of something long and
dark with red eyes, just as we saw in the sunset, and something very
sweet and very bitter all around me at once; and then I seemed sinking
into deep green water, and there was a singing in my ears, as I have
heard there is to drowning men; and then everything seemed passing away
from me; my soul seemed to go out from my body and float about the air.
I seem to remember that once the West Lighthouse was right under me,
and then there was a sort of agonising feeling, as if I were in an
earthquake, and I came back and found you shaking my body. I saw you do
it before I felt you.”
Then she began to laugh. It seemed a little uncanny to me, and I
listened to her breathlessly. I did not quite like it, and thought it
better not to keep her mind on the subject, so we drifted on to other
subjects, and Lucy was like her old self again. When we got home the
fresh breeze had braced her up, and her pale cheeks were really more
rosy. Her mother rejoiced when she saw her, and we all spent a very
happy evening together.

19 August.—Joy, joy, joy! although not all joy. At last, news of
Jonathan. The dear fellow has been ill; that is why he did not write. I
am not afraid to think it or say it, now that I know. Mr. Hawkins sent
me on the letter, and wrote himself, oh, so kindly. I am to leave in the
morning and go over to Jonathan, and to help to nurse him if necessary,
and to bring him home. Mr. Hawkins says it would not be a bad thing if
we were to be married out there. I have cried over the good Sister’s
letter till I can feel it wet against my bosom, where it lies. It is of
Jonathan, and must be next my heart, for he is in my heart. My journey
is all mapped out, and my luggage ready. I am only taking one change of
dress; Lucy will bring my trunk to London and keep it till I send for
it, for it may be that ... I must write no more; I must keep it to say
to Jonathan, my husband. The letter that he has seen and touched must
comfort me till we meet.
Letter, Sister Agatha, Hospital of St. Joseph and Ste. Mary,
Buda-Pesth, to Miss Wilhelmina Murray.
“12 August.
“Dear Madam,—
“I write by desire of Mr. Jonathan Harker, who is himself not strong
enough to write, though progressing well, thanks to God and St. Joseph
and Ste. Mary. He has been under our care for nearly six weeks,
suffering from a violent brain fever. He wishes me to convey his love,
and to say that by this post I write for him to Mr. Peter Hawkins,
Exeter, to say, with his dutiful respects, that he is sorry for his
delay, and that all of his work is completed. He will require some few
weeks’ rest in our sanatorium in the hills, but will then return. He
wishes me to say that he has not sufficient money with him, and that he
would like to pay for his staying here, so that others who need shall
not be wanting for help.
“Believe me,
“Yours, with sympathy and all blessings,
“Sister Agatha.
“P. S.—My patient being asleep, I open this to let you know something
more. He has told me all about you, and that you are shortly to be his
wife. All blessings to you both! He has had some fearful shock—so says
our doctor—and in his delirium his ravings have been dreadful; of
wolves and poison and blood; of ghosts and demons; and I fear to say of
what. Be careful with him always that there may be nothing to excite him
of this kind for a long time to come; the traces of such an illness as
his do not lightly die away. We should have written long ago, but we
knew nothing of his friends, and there was on him nothing that any one
could understand. He came in the train from Klausenburg, and the guard
was told by the station-master there that he rushed into the station
shouting for a ticket for home. Seeing from his violent demeanour that
he was English, they gave him a ticket for the furthest station on the
way thither that the train reached.
“Be assured that he is well cared for. He has won all hearts by his
sweetness and gentleness. He is truly getting on well, and I have no
doubt will in a few weeks be all himself. But be careful of him for
safety’s sake. There are, I pray God and St. Joseph and Ste. Mary, many,
many, happy years for you both.”
Dr. Seward’s Diary.
19 August.—Strange and sudden change in Renfield last night. About
eight o’clock he began to get excited and sniff about as a dog does when
setting. The attendant was struck by his manner, and knowing my interest
in him, encouraged him to talk. He is usually respectful to the
attendant and at times servile; but to-night, the man tells me, he was
quite haughty. Would not condescend to talk with him at all. All he
would say was:—
“I don’t want to talk to you: you don’t count now; the Master is at
hand.”
The attendant thinks it is some sudden form of religious mania which has
seized him. If so, we must look out for squalls, for a strong man with
homicidal and religious mania at once might be dangerous. The
combination is a dreadful one. At nine o’clock I visited him myself. His
attitude to me was the same as that to the attendant; in his sublime
self-feeling the difference between myself and attendant seemed to him
as nothing. It looks like religious mania, and he will soon think that
he himself is God. These infinitesimal distinctions between man and man
are too paltry for an Omnipotent Being. How these madmen give themselves
away! The real God taketh heed lest a sparrow fall; but the God created
from human vanity sees no difference between an eagle and a sparrow. Oh,
if men only knew!
For half an hour or more Renfield kept getting excited in greater and
greater degree. I did not pretend to be watching him, but I kept strict
observation all the same. All at once that shifty look came into his
eyes which we always see when a madman has seized an idea, and with it
the shifty movement of the head and back which asylum attendants come to
know so well. He became quite quiet, and went and sat on the edge of his
bed resignedly, and looked into space with lack-lustre eyes. I thought I
would find out if his apathy were real or only assumed, and tried to
lead him to talk of his pets, a theme which had never failed to excite
his attention. At first he made no reply, but at length said testily:—
“Bother them all! I don’t care a pin about them.”
“What?” I said. “You don’t mean to tell me you don’t care about
spiders?” (Spiders at present are his hobby and the note-book is filling
up with columns of small figures.) To this he answered enigmatically:—
“The bride-maidens rejoice the eyes that wait the coming of the bride;
but when the bride draweth nigh, then the maidens shine not to the eyes
that are filled.”
He would not explain himself, but remained obstinately seated on his bed
all the time I remained with him.
I am weary to-night and low in spirits. I cannot but think of Lucy, and
how different things might have been. If I don’t sleep at once, chloral,
the modern Morpheus—C2HCl3O. H2O! I must be careful not to let
it grow into a habit. No, I shall take none to-night! I have thought of
Lucy, and I shall not dishonour her by mixing the two. If need be,
to-night shall be sleepless....

Later.—Glad I made the resolution; gladder that I kept to it. I had
lain tossing about, and had heard the clock strike only twice, when the
night-watchman came to me, sent up from the ward, to say that Renfield
had escaped. I threw on my clothes and ran down at once; my patient is
too dangerous a person to be roaming about. Those ideas of his might
work out dangerously with strangers. The attendant was waiting for me.
He said he had seen him not ten minutes before, seemingly asleep in his
bed, when he had looked through the observation-trap in the door. His
attention was called by the sound of the window being wrenched out. He
ran back and saw his feet disappear through the window, and had at once
sent up for me. He was only in his night-gear, and cannot be far off.
The attendant thought it would be more useful to watch where he should
go than to follow him, as he might lose sight of him whilst getting out
of the building by the door. He is a bulky man, and couldn’t get through
the window. I am thin, so, with his aid, I got out, but feet foremost,
and, as we were only a few feet above ground, landed unhurt. The
attendant told me the patient had gone to the left, and had taken a
straight line, so I ran as quickly as I could. As I got through the belt
of trees I saw a white figure scale the high wall which separates our
grounds from those of the deserted house.
I ran back at once, told the watchman to get three or four men
immediately and follow me into the grounds of Carfax, in case our friend
might be dangerous. I got a ladder myself, and crossing the wall,
dropped down on the other side. I could see Renfield’s figure just
disappearing behind the angle of the house, so I ran after him. On the
far side of the house I found him pressed close against the old
ironbound oak door of the chapel. He was talking, apparently to some
one, but I was afraid to go near enough to hear what he was saying, lest
I might frighten him, and he should run off. Chasing an errant swarm of
bees is nothing to following a naked lunatic, when the fit of escaping
is upon him! After a few minutes, however, I could see that he did not
take note of anything around him, and so ventured to draw nearer to
him—the more so as my men had now crossed the wall and were closing him
in. I heard him say:—
“I am here to do Your bidding, Master. I am Your slave, and You will
reward me, for I shall be faithful. I have worshipped You long and afar
off. Now that You are near, I await Your commands, and You will not pass
me by, will You, dear Master, in Your distribution of good things?”
He is a selfish old beggar anyhow. He thinks of the loaves and fishes
even when he believes he is in a Real Presence. His manias make a
startling combination. When we closed in on him he fought like a tiger.
He is immensely strong, for he was more like a wild beast than a man. I
never saw a lunatic in such a paroxysm of rage before; and I hope I
shall not again. It is a mercy that we have found out his strength and
his danger in good time. With strength and determination like his, he
might have done wild work before he was caged. He is safe now at any
rate. Jack Sheppard himself couldn’t get free from the strait-waistcoat
that keeps him restrained, and he’s chained to the wall in the padded
room. His cries are at times awful, but the silences that follow are
more deadly still, for he means murder in every turn and movement.
Just now he spoke coherent words for the first time:—
“I shall be patient, Master. It is coming—coming—coming!”
So I took the hint, and came too. I was too excited to sleep, but this
diary has quieted me, and I feel I shall get some sleep to-night.
Letter, Mina Harker to Lucy Westenra.
“Buda-Pesth, 24 August.
“My dearest Lucy,—
“I know you will be anxious to hear all that has happened since we
parted at the railway station at Whitby. Well, my dear, I got to Hull
all right, and caught the boat to Hamburg, and then the train on here. I
feel that I can hardly recall anything of the journey, except that I
knew I was coming to Jonathan, and, that as I should have to do some
nursing, I had better get all the sleep I could.... I found my dear one,
oh, so thin and pale and weak-looking. All the resolution has gone out
of his dear eyes, and that quiet dignity which I told you was in his
face has vanished. He is only a wreck of himself, and he does not
remember anything that has happened to him for a long time past. At
least, he wants me to believe so, and I shall never ask. He has had some
terrible shock, and I fear it might tax his poor brain if he were to try
to recall it. Sister Agatha, who is a good creature and a born nurse,
tells me that he raved of dreadful things whilst he was off his head. I
wanted her to tell me what they were; but she would only cross herself,
and say she would never tell; that the ravings of the sick were the
secrets of God, and that if a nurse through her vocation should hear
them, she should respect her trust. She is a sweet, good soul, and the
next day, when she saw I was troubled, she opened up the subject again,
and after saying that she could never mention what my poor dear raved
about, added: ‘I can tell you this much, my dear: that it was not about
anything which he has done wrong himself; and you, as his wife to be,
have no cause to be concerned. He has not forgotten you or what he owes
to you. His fear was of great and terrible things, which no mortal can
treat of.’ I do believe the dear soul thought I might be jealous lest my
poor dear should have fallen in love with any other girl. The idea of
my being jealous about Jonathan! And yet, my dear, let me whisper, I
felt a thrill of joy through me when I knew that no other woman was a
cause of trouble. I am now sitting by his bedside, where I can see his
face while he sleeps. He is waking!...
“When he woke he asked me for his coat, as he wanted to get something
from the pocket; I asked Sister Agatha, and she brought all his things.
I saw that amongst them was his note-book, and was going to ask him to
let me look at it—for I knew then that I might find some clue to his
trouble—but I suppose he must have seen my wish in my eyes, for he sent
me over to the window, saying he wanted to be quite alone for a moment.
Then he called me back, and when I came he had his hand over the
note-book, and he said to me very solemnly:—
“‘Wilhelmina’—I knew then that he was in deadly earnest, for he has
never called me by that name since he asked me to marry him—‘you know,
dear, my ideas of the trust between husband and wife: there should be no
secret, no concealment. I have had a great shock, and when I try to
think of what it is I feel my head spin round, and I do not know if it
was all real or the dreaming of a madman. You know I have had brain
fever, and that is to be mad. The secret is here, and I do not want to
know it. I want to take up my life here, with our marriage.’ For, my
dear, we had decided to be married as soon as the formalities are
complete. ‘Are you willing, Wilhelmina, to share my ignorance? Here is
the book. Take it and keep it, read it if you will, but never let me
know; unless, indeed, some solemn duty should come upon me to go back to
the bitter hours, asleep or awake, sane or mad, recorded here.’ He fell
back exhausted, and I put the book under his pillow, and kissed him. I
have asked Sister Agatha to beg the Superior to let our wedding be this
afternoon, and am waiting her reply....

“She has come and told me that the chaplain of the English mission
church has been sent for. We are to be married in an hour, or as soon
after as Jonathan awakes....

“Lucy, the time has come and gone. I feel very solemn, but very, very
happy. Jonathan woke a little after the hour, and all was ready, and he
sat up in bed, propped up with pillows. He answered his ‘I will’ firmly
and strongly. I could hardly speak; my heart was so full that even those
words seemed to choke me. The dear sisters were so kind. Please God, I
shall never, never forget them, nor the grave and sweet responsibilities
I have taken upon me. I must tell you of my wedding present. When the
chaplain and the sisters had left me alone with my husband—oh, Lucy, it
is the first time I have written the words ‘my husband’—left me alone
with my husband, I took the book from under his pillow, and wrapped it
up in white paper, and tied it with a little bit of pale blue ribbon
which was round my neck, and sealed it over the knot with sealing-wax,
and for my seal I used my wedding ring. Then I kissed it and showed it
to my husband, and told him that I would keep it so, and then it would
be an outward and visible sign for us all our lives that we trusted each
other; that I would never open it unless it were for his own dear sake
or for the sake of some stern duty. Then he took my hand in his, and oh,
Lucy, it was the first time he took his wife’s hand, and said that it
was the dearest thing in all the wide world, and that he would go
through all the past again to win it, if need be. The poor dear meant to
have said a part of the past, but he cannot think of time yet, and I
shall not wonder if at first he mixes up not only the month, but the
year.
“Well, my dear, what could I say? I could only tell him that I was the
happiest woman in all the wide world, and that I had nothing to give him
except myself, my life, and my trust, and that with these went my love
and duty for all the days of my life. And, my dear, when he kissed me,
and drew me to him with his poor weak hands, it was like a very solemn
pledge between us....
“Lucy dear, do you know why I tell you all this? It is not only because
it is all sweet to me, but because you have been, and are, very dear to
me. It was my privilege to be your friend and guide when you came from
the schoolroom to prepare for the world of life. I want you to see now,
and with the eyes of a very happy wife, whither duty has led me; so that
in your own married life you too may be all happy as I am. My dear,
please Almighty God, your life may be all it promises: a long day of
sunshine, with no harsh wind, no forgetting duty, no distrust. I must
not wish you no pain, for that can never be; but I do hope you will be
always as happy as I am now. Good-bye, my dear. I shall post this at
once, and, perhaps, write you very soon again. I must stop, for Jonathan
is waking—I must attend to my husband!
“Your ever-loving
“Mina Harker.”
Letter, Lucy Westenra to Mina Harker.
“Whitby, 30 August.
“My dearest Mina,—
“Oceans of love and millions of kisses, and may you soon be in your own
home with your husband. I wish you could be coming home soon enough to
stay with us here. The strong air would soon restore Jonathan; it has
quite restored me. I have an appetite like a cormorant, am full of
life, and sleep well. You will be glad to know that I have quite given
up walking in my sleep. I think I have not stirred out of my bed for a
week, that is when I once got into it at night. Arthur says I am getting
fat. By the way, I forgot to tell you that Arthur is here. We have such
walks and drives, and rides, and rowing, and tennis, and fishing
together; and I love him more than ever. He tells me that he loves me
more, but I doubt that, for at first he told me that he couldn’t love me
more than he did then. But this is nonsense. There he is, calling to me.
So no more just at present from your loving
“Lucy.
“P. S.—Mother sends her love. She seems better, poor dear.
“P. P. S.—We are to be married on 28 September.”
Dr. Seward’s Diary.
20 August.—The case of Renfield grows even more interesting. He has
now so far quieted that there are spells of cessation from his passion.
For the first week after his attack he was perpetually violent. Then one
night, just as the moon rose, he grew quiet, and kept murmuring to
himself: “Now I can wait; now I can wait.” The attendant came to tell
me, so I ran down at once to have a look at him. He was still in the
strait-waistcoat and in the padded room, but the suffused look had gone
from his face, and his eyes had something of their old pleading—I might
almost say, “cringing”—softness. I was satisfied with his present
condition, and directed him to be relieved. The attendants hesitated,
but finally carried out my wishes without protest. It was a strange
thing that the patient had humour enough to see their distrust, for,
coming close to me, he said in a whisper, all the while looking
furtively at them:—
“They think I could hurt you! Fancy me hurting you! The fools!”
It was soothing, somehow, to the feelings to find myself dissociated
even in the mind of this poor madman from the others; but all the same I
do not follow his thought. Am I to take it that I have anything in
common with him, so that we are, as it were, to stand together; or has
he to gain from me some good so stupendous that my well-being is needful
to him? I must find out later on. To-night he will not speak. Even the
offer of a kitten or even a full-grown cat will not tempt him. He will
only say: “I don’t take any stock in cats. I have more to think of now,
and I can wait; I can wait.”
After a while I left him. The attendant tells me that he was quiet
until just before dawn, and that then he began to get uneasy, and at
length violent, until at last he fell into a paroxysm which exhausted
him so that he swooned into a sort of coma.

... Three nights has the same thing happened—violent all day then quiet
from moonrise to sunrise. I wish I could get some clue to the cause. It
would almost seem as if there was some influence which came and went.
Happy thought! We shall to-night play sane wits against mad ones. He
escaped before without our help; to-night he shall escape with it. We
shall give him a chance, and have the men ready to follow in case they
are required....

23 August.—“The unexpected always happens.” How well Disraeli knew
life. Our bird when he found the cage open would not fly, so all our
subtle arrangements were for nought. At any rate, we have proved one
thing; that the spells of quietness last a reasonable time. We shall in
future be able to ease his bonds for a few hours each day. I have given
orders to the night attendant merely to shut him in the padded room,
when once he is quiet, until an hour before sunrise. The poor soul’s
body will enjoy the relief even if his mind cannot appreciate it. Hark!
The unexpected again! I am called; the patient has once more escaped.

Later.—Another night adventure. Renfield artfully waited until the
attendant was entering the room to inspect. Then he dashed out past him
and flew down the passage. I sent word for the attendants to follow.
Again he went into the grounds of the deserted house, and we found him
in the same place, pressed against the old chapel door. When he saw me
he became furious, and had not the attendants seized him in time, he
would have tried to kill me. As we were holding him a strange thing
happened. He suddenly redoubled his efforts, and then as suddenly grew
calm. I looked round instinctively, but could see nothing. Then I caught
the patient’s eye and followed it, but could trace nothing as it looked
into the moonlit sky except a big bat, which was flapping its silent and
ghostly way to the west. Bats usually wheel and flit about, but this one
seemed to go straight on, as if it knew where it was bound for or had
some intention of its own. The patient grew calmer every instant, and
presently said:—
“You needn’t tie me; I shall go quietly!” Without trouble we came back
to the house. I feel there is something ominous in his calm, and shall
not forget this night....
Lucy Westenra’s Diary
Hillingham, 24 August.—I must imitate Mina, and keep writing things
down. Then we can have long talks when we do meet. I wonder when it will
be. I wish she were with me again, for I feel so unhappy. Last night I
seemed to be dreaming again just as I was at Whitby. Perhaps it is the
change of air, or getting home again. It is all dark and horrid to me,
for I can remember nothing; but I am full of vague fear, and I feel so
weak and worn out. When Arthur came to lunch he looked quite grieved
when he saw me, and I hadn’t the spirit to try to be cheerful. I wonder
if I could sleep in mother’s room to-night. I shall make an excuse and
try.

25 August.—Another bad night. Mother did not seem to take to my
proposal. She seems not too well herself, and doubtless she fears to
worry me. I tried to keep awake, and succeeded for a while; but when the
clock struck twelve it waked me from a doze, so I must have been falling
asleep. There was a sort of scratching or flapping at the window, but I
did not mind it, and as I remember no more, I suppose I must then have
fallen asleep. More bad dreams. I wish I could remember them. This
morning I am horribly weak. My face is ghastly pale, and my throat pains
me. It must be something wrong with my lungs, for I don’t seem ever to
get air enough. I shall try to cheer up when Arthur comes, or else I
know he will be miserable to see me so.
Letter, Arthur Holmwood to Dr. Seward.
“Albemarle Hotel, 31 August.
“My dear Jack,—
“I want you to do me a favour. Lucy is ill; that is, she has no special
disease, but she looks awful, and is getting worse every day. I have
asked her if there is any cause; I do not dare to ask her mother, for to
disturb the poor lady’s mind about her daughter in her present state of
health would be fatal. Mrs. Westenra has confided to me that her doom is
spoken—disease of the heart—though poor Lucy does not know it yet. I
am sure that there is something preying on my dear girl’s mind. I am
almost distracted when I think of her; to look at her gives me a pang. I
told her I should ask you to see her, and though she demurred at
first—I know why, old fellow—she finally consented. It will be a
painful task for you, I know, old friend, but it is for her sake, and
I must not hesitate to ask, or you to act. You are to come to lunch at
Hillingham to-morrow, two o’clock, so as not to arouse any suspicion in
Mrs. Westenra, and after lunch Lucy will take an opportunity of being
alone with you. I shall come in for tea, and we can go away together; I
am filled with anxiety, and want to consult with you alone as soon as I
can after you have seen her. Do not fail!
“Arthur.”
Telegram, Arthur Holmwood to Seward.
“1 September.
“Am summoned to see my father, who is worse. Am writing. Write me fully
by to-night’s post to Ring. Wire me if necessary.”
Letter from Dr. Seward to Arthur Holmwood.
“2 September.
“My dear old fellow,—
“With regard to Miss Westenra’s health I hasten to let you know at once
that in my opinion there is not any functional disturbance or any malady
that I know of. At the same time, I am not by any means satisfied with
her appearance; she is woefully different from what she was when I saw
her last. Of course you must bear in mind that I did not have full
opportunity of examination such as I should wish; our very friendship
makes a little difficulty which not even medical science or custom can
bridge over. I had better tell you exactly what happened, leaving you to
draw, in a measure, your own conclusions. I shall then say what I have
done and propose doing.
“I found Miss Westenra in seemingly gay spirits. Her mother was present,
and in a few seconds I made up my mind that she was trying all she knew
to mislead her mother and prevent her from being anxious. I have no
doubt she guesses, if she does not know, what need of caution there is.
We lunched alone, and as we all exerted ourselves to be cheerful, we
got, as some kind of reward for our labours, some real cheerfulness
amongst us. Then Mrs. Westenra went to lie down, and Lucy was left with
me. We went into her boudoir, and till we got there her gaiety remained,
for the servants were coming and going. As soon as the door was closed,
however, the mask fell from her face, and she sank down into a chair
with a great sigh, and hid her eyes with her hand. When I saw that her
high spirits had failed, I at once took advantage of her reaction to
make a diagnosis. She said to me very sweetly:—
“‘I cannot tell you how I loathe talking about myself.’ I reminded her
that a doctor’s confidence was sacred, but that you were grievously
anxious about her. She caught on to my meaning at once, and settled that
matter in a word. ‘Tell Arthur everything you choose. I do not care for
myself, but all for him!’ So I am quite free.
“I could easily see that she is somewhat bloodless, but I could not see
the usual anæmic signs, and by a chance I was actually able to test the
quality of her blood, for in opening a window which was stiff a cord
gave way, and she cut her hand slightly with broken glass. It was a
slight matter in itself, but it gave me an evident chance, and I secured
a few drops of the blood and have analysed them. The qualitative
analysis gives a quite normal condition, and shows, I should infer, in
itself a vigorous state of health. In other physical matters I was quite
satisfied that there is no need for anxiety; but as there must be a
cause somewhere, I have come to the conclusion that it must be something
mental. She complains of difficulty in breathing satisfactorily at
times, and of heavy, lethargic sleep, with dreams that frighten her, but
regarding which she can remember nothing. She says that as a child she
used to walk in her sleep, and that when in Whitby the habit came back,
and that once she walked out in the night and went to East Cliff, where
Miss Murray found her; but she assures me that of late the habit has not
returned. I am in doubt, and so have done the best thing I know of; I
have written to my old friend and master, Professor Van Helsing, of
Amsterdam, who knows as much about obscure diseases as any one in the
world. I have asked him to come over, and as you told me that all things
were to be at your charge, I have mentioned to him who you are and your
relations to Miss Westenra. This, my dear fellow, is in obedience to
your wishes, for I am only too proud and happy to do anything I can for
her. Van Helsing would, I know, do anything for me for a personal
reason, so, no matter on what ground he comes, we must accept his
wishes. He is a seemingly arbitrary man, but this is because he knows
what he is talking about better than any one else. He is a philosopher
and a metaphysician, and one of the most advanced scientists of his day;
and he has, I believe, an absolutely open mind. This, with an iron
nerve, a temper of the ice-brook, an indomitable resolution,
self-command, and toleration exalted from virtues to blessings, and the
kindliest and truest heart that beats—these form his equipment for the
noble work that he is doing for mankind—work both in theory and
practice, for his views are as wide as his all-embracing sympathy. I
tell you these facts that you may know why I have such confidence in
him. I have asked him to come at once. I shall see Miss Westenra
to-morrow again. She is to meet me at the Stores, so that I may not
alarm her mother by too early a repetition of my call.
“Yours always,
“John Seward.”
Letter, Abraham Van Helsing, M. D., D. Ph., D. Lit., etc., etc., to Dr.
Seward.
“2 September.
“My good Friend,—
“When I have received your letter I am already coming to you. By good
fortune I can leave just at once, without wrong to any of those who have
trusted me. Were fortune other, then it were bad for those who have
trusted, for I come to my friend when he call me to aid those he holds
dear. Tell your friend that when that time you suck from my wound so
swiftly the poison of the gangrene from that knife that our other
friend, too nervous, let slip, you did more for him when he wants my
aids and you call for them than all his great fortune could do. But it
is pleasure added to do for him, your friend; it is to you that I come.
Have then rooms for me at the Great Eastern Hotel, so that I may be near
to hand, and please it so arrange that we may see the young lady not too
late on to-morrow, for it is likely that I may have to return here that
night. But if need be I shall come again in three days, and stay longer
if it must. Till then good-bye, my friend John.
“Van Helsing.”
Letter, Dr. Seward to Hon. Arthur Holmwood.
“3 September.
“My dear Art,—
“Van Helsing has come and gone. He came on with me to Hillingham, and
found that, by Lucy’s discretion, her mother was lunching out, so that
we were alone with her. Van Helsing made a very careful examination of
the patient. He is to report to me, and I shall advise you, for of
course I was not present all the time. He is, I fear, much concerned,
but says he must think. When I told him of our friendship and how you
trust to me in the matter, he said: ‘You must tell him all you think.
Tell him what I think, if you can guess it, if you will. Nay, I am not
jesting. This is no jest, but life and death, perhaps more.’ I asked
what he meant by that, for he was very serious. This was when we had
come back to town, and he was having a cup of tea before starting on his
return to Amsterdam. He would not give me any further clue. You must not
be angry with me, Art, because his very reticence means that all his
brains are working for her good. He will speak plainly enough when the
time comes, be sure. So I told him I would simply write an account of
our visit, just as if I were doing a descriptive special article for
The Daily Telegraph. He seemed not to notice, but remarked that the
smuts in London were not quite so bad as they used to be when he was a
student here. I am to get his report to-morrow if he can possibly make
it. In any case I am to have a letter.
“Well, as to the visit. Lucy was more cheerful than on the day I first
saw her, and certainly looked better. She had lost something of the
ghastly look that so upset you, and her breathing was normal. She was
very sweet to the professor (as she always is), and tried to make him
feel at ease; though I could see that the poor girl was making a hard
struggle for it. I believe Van Helsing saw it, too, for I saw the quick
look under his bushy brows that I knew of old. Then he began to chat of
all things except ourselves and diseases and with such an infinite
geniality that I could see poor Lucy’s pretense of animation merge into
reality. Then, without any seeming change, he brought the conversation
gently round to his visit, and suavely said:—
“‘My dear young miss, I have the so great pleasure because you are so
much beloved. That is much, my dear, ever were there that which I do not
see. They told me you were down in the spirit, and that you were of a
ghastly pale. To them I say: “Pouf!”’ And he snapped his fingers at me
and went on: ‘But you and I shall show them how wrong they are. How can
he’—and he pointed at me with the same look and gesture as that with
which once he pointed me out to his class, on, or rather after, a
particular occasion which he never fails to remind me of—‘know anything
of a young ladies? He has his madmans to play with, and to bring them
back to happiness, and to those that love them. It is much to do, and,
oh, but there are rewards, in that we can bestow such happiness. But the
young ladies! He has no wife nor daughter, and the young do not tell
themselves to the young, but to the old, like me, who have known so many
sorrows and the causes of them. So, my dear, we will send him away to
smoke the cigarette in the garden, whiles you and I have little talk all
to ourselves.’ I took the hint, and strolled about, and presently the
professor came to the window and called me in. He looked grave, but
said: ‘I have made careful examination, but there is no functional
cause. With you I agree that there has been much blood lost; it has
been, but is not. But the conditions of her are in no way anæmic. I have
asked her to send me her maid, that I may ask just one or two question,
that so I may not chance to miss nothing. I know well what she will say.
And yet there is cause; there is always cause for everything. I must go
back home and think. You must send to me the telegram every day; and if
there be cause I shall come again. The disease—for not to be all well
is a disease—interest me, and the sweet young dear, she interest me
too. She charm me, and for her, if not for you or disease, I come.’
“As I tell you, he would not say a word more, even when we were alone.
And so now, Art, you know all I know. I shall keep stern watch. I trust
your poor father is rallying. It must be a terrible thing to you, my
dear old fellow, to be placed in such a position between two people who
are both so dear to you. I know your idea of duty to your father, and
you are right to stick to it; but, if need be, I shall send you word to
come at once to Lucy; so do not be over-anxious unless you hear from
me.”
Dr. Seward’s Diary.
4 September.—Zoöphagous patient still keeps up our interest in him.
He had only one outburst and that was yesterday at an unusual time. Just
before the stroke of noon he began to grow restless. The attendant knew
the symptoms, and at once summoned aid. Fortunately the men came at a
run, and were just in time, for at the stroke of noon he became so
violent that it took all their strength to hold him. In about five
minutes, however, he began to get more and more quiet, and finally sank
into a sort of melancholy, in which state he has remained up to now. The
attendant tells me that his screams whilst in the paroxysm were really
appalling; I found my hands full when I got in, attending to some of the
other patients who were frightened by him. Indeed, I can quite
understand the effect, for the sounds disturbed even me, though I was
some distance away. It is now after the dinner-hour of the asylum, and
as yet my patient sits in a corner brooding, with a dull, sullen,
woe-begone look in his face, which seems rather to indicate than to show
something directly. I cannot quite understand it.

Later.—Another change in my patient. At five o’clock I looked in on
him, and found him seemingly as happy and contented as he used to be. He
was catching flies and eating them, and was keeping note of his capture
by making nail-marks on the edge of the door between the ridges of
padding. When he saw me, he came over and apologised for his bad
conduct, and asked me in a very humble, cringing way to be led back to
his own room and to have his note-book again. I thought it well to
humour him: so he is back in his room with the window open. He has the
sugar of his tea spread out on the window-sill, and is reaping quite a
harvest of flies. He is not now eating them, but putting them into a
box, as of old, and is already examining the corners of his room to find
a spider. I tried to get him to talk about the past few days, for any
clue to his thoughts would be of immense help to me; but he would not
rise. For a moment or two he looked very sad, and said in a sort of
far-away voice, as though saying it rather to himself than to me:—
“All over! all over! He has deserted me. No hope for me now unless I do
it for myself!” Then suddenly turning to me in a resolute way, he said:
“Doctor, won’t you be very good to me and let me have a little more
sugar? I think it would be good for me.”
“And the flies?” I said.
“Yes! The flies like it, too, and I like the flies; therefore I like
it.” And there are people who know so little as to think that madmen do
not argue. I procured him a double supply, and left him as happy a man
as, I suppose, any in the world. I wish I could fathom his mind.

Midnight.—Another change in him. I had been to see Miss Westenra,
whom I found much better, and had just returned, and was standing at our
own gate looking at the sunset, when once more I heard him yelling. As
his room is on this side of the house, I could hear it better than in
the morning. It was a shock to me to turn from the wonderful smoky
beauty of a sunset over London, with its lurid lights and inky shadows
and all the marvellous tints that come on foul clouds even as on foul
water, and to realise all the grim sternness of my own cold stone
building, with its wealth of breathing misery, and my own desolate heart
to endure it all. I reached him just as the sun was going down, and from
his window saw the red disc sink. As it sank he became less and less
frenzied; and just as it dipped he slid from the hands that held him, an
inert mass, on the floor. It is wonderful, however, what intellectual
recuperative power lunatics have, for within a few minutes he stood up
quite calmly and looked around him. I signalled to the attendants not to
hold him, for I was anxious to see what he would do. He went straight
over to the window and brushed out the crumbs of sugar; then he took his
fly-box, and emptied it outside, and threw away the box; then he shut
the window, and crossing over, sat down on his bed. All this surprised
me, so I asked him: “Are you not going to keep flies any more?”
“No,” said he; “I am sick of all that rubbish!” He certainly is a
wonderfully interesting study. I wish I could get some glimpse of his
mind or of the cause of his sudden passion. Stop; there may be a clue
after all, if we can find why to-day his paroxysms came on at high noon
and at sunset. Can it be that there is a malign influence of the sun at
periods which affects certain natures—as at times the moon does others?
We shall see.

“6 September.
“My dear Art,—
“My news to-day is not so good. Lucy this morning had gone back a bit.
There is, however, one good thing which has arisen from it; Mrs.
Westenra was naturally anxious concerning Lucy, and has consulted me
professionally about her. I took advantage of the opportunity, and told
her that my old master, Van Helsing, the great specialist, was coming to
stay with me, and that I would put her in his charge conjointly with
myself; so now we can come and go without alarming her unduly, for a
shock to her would mean sudden death, and this, in Lucy’s weak
condition, might be disastrous to her. We are hedged in with
difficulties, all of us, my poor old fellow; but, please God, we shall
come through them all right. If any need I shall write, so that, if you
do not hear from me, take it for granted that I am simply waiting for
news. In haste
Yours ever,
“John Seward.”
Dr. Seward’s Diary.
7 September.—The first thing Van Helsing said to me when we met at
Liverpool Street was:—
“Have you said anything to our young friend the lover of her?”
“No,” I said. “I waited till I had seen you, as I said in my telegram. I
wrote him a letter simply telling him that you were coming, as Miss
Westenra was not so well, and that I should let him know if need be.”
“Right, my friend,” he said, “quite right! Better he not know as yet;
perhaps he shall never know. I pray so; but if it be needed, then he
shall know all. And, my good friend John, let me caution you. You deal
with the madmen. All men are mad in some way or the other; and inasmuch
as you deal discreetly with your madmen, so deal with God’s madmen,
too—the rest of the world. You tell not your madmen what you do nor why
you do it; you tell them not what you think. So you shall keep knowledge
in its place, where it may rest—where it may gather its kind around it
and breed. You and I shall keep as yet what we know here, and here.” He
touched me on the heart and on the forehead, and then touched himself
the same way. “I have for myself thoughts at the present. Later I shall
unfold to you.”
“Why not now?” I asked. “It may do some good; we may arrive at some
decision.” He stopped and looked at me, and said:—
“My friend John, when the corn is grown, even before it has
ripened—while the milk of its mother-earth is in him, and the sunshine
has not yet begun to paint him with his gold, the husbandman he pull the
ear and rub him between his rough hands, and blow away the green chaff,
and say to you: ‘Look! he’s good corn; he will make good crop when the
time comes.’” I did not see the application, and told him so. For reply
he reached over and took my ear in his hand and pulled it playfully, as
he used long ago to do at lectures, and said: “The good husbandman tell
you so then because he knows, but not till then. But you do not find the
good husbandman dig up his planted corn to see if he grow; that is for
the children who play at husbandry, and not for those who take it as of
the work of their life. See you now, friend John? I have sown my corn,
and Nature has her work to do in making it sprout; if he sprout at all,
there’s some promise; and I wait till the ear begins to swell.” He broke
off, for he evidently saw that I understood. Then he went on, and very
gravely:—
“You were always a careful student, and your case-book was ever more
full than the rest. You were only student then; now you are master, and
I trust that good habit have not fail. Remember, my friend, that
knowledge is stronger than memory, and we should not trust the weaker.
Even if you have not kept the good practise, let me tell you that this
case of our dear miss is one that may be—mind, I say may be—of such
interest to us and others that all the rest may not make him kick the
beam, as your peoples say. Take then good note of it. Nothing is too
small. I counsel you, put down in record even your doubts and surmises.
Hereafter it may be of interest to you to see how true you guess. We
learn from failure, not from success!”
When I described Lucy’s symptoms—the same as before, but infinitely
more marked—he looked very grave, but said nothing. He took with him a
bag in which were many instruments and drugs, “the ghastly paraphernalia
of our beneficial trade,” as he once called, in one of his lectures, the
equipment of a professor of the healing craft. When we were shown in,
Mrs. Westenra met us. She was alarmed, but not nearly so much as I
expected to find her. Nature in one of her beneficent moods has ordained
that even death has some antidote to its own terrors. Here, in a case
where any shock may prove fatal, matters are so ordered that, from some
cause or other, the things not personal—even the terrible change in her
daughter to whom she is so attached—do not seem to reach her. It is
something like the way Dame Nature gathers round a foreign body an
envelope of some insensitive tissue which can protect from evil that
which it would otherwise harm by contact. If this be an ordered
selfishness, then we should pause before we condemn any one for the vice
of egoism, for there may be deeper root for its causes than we have
knowledge of.
I used my knowledge of this phase of spiritual pathology, and laid down
a rule that she should not be present with Lucy or think of her illness
more than was absolutely required. She assented readily, so readily that
I saw again the hand of Nature fighting for life. Van Helsing and I were
shown up to Lucy’s room. If I was shocked when I saw her yesterday, I
was horrified when I saw her to-day. She was ghastly, chalkily pale; the
red seemed to have gone even from her lips and gums, and the bones of
her face stood out prominently; her breathing was painful to see or
hear. Van Helsing’s face grew set as marble, and his eyebrows converged
till they almost touched over his nose. Lucy lay motionless, and did not
seem to have strength to speak, so for a while we were all silent. Then
Van Helsing beckoned to me, and we went gently out of the room. The
instant we had closed the door he stepped quickly along the passage to
the next door, which was open. Then he pulled me quickly in with him and
closed the door. “My God!” he said; “this is dreadful. There is no time
to be lost. She will die for sheer want of blood to keep the heart’s
action as it should be. There must be transfusion of blood at once. Is
it you or me?”
“I am younger and stronger, Professor. It must be me.”
“Then get ready at once. I will bring up my bag. I am prepared.”
I went downstairs with him, and as we were going there was a knock at
the hall-door. When we reached the hall the maid had just opened the
door, and Arthur was stepping quickly in. He rushed up to me, saying in
an eager whisper:—
“Jack, I was so anxious. I read between the lines of your letter, and
have been in an agony. The dad was better, so I ran down here to see for
myself. Is not that gentleman Dr. Van Helsing? I am so thankful to you,
sir, for coming.” When first the Professor’s eye had lit upon him he had
been angry at his interruption at such a time; but now, as he took in
his stalwart proportions and recognised the strong young manhood which
seemed to emanate from him, his eyes gleamed. Without a pause he said to
him gravely as he held out his hand:—
“Sir, you have come in time. You are the lover of our dear miss. She is
bad, very, very bad. Nay, my child, do not go like that.” For he
suddenly grew pale and sat down in a chair almost fainting. “You are to
help her. You can do more than any that live, and your courage is your
best help.”
“What can I do?” asked Arthur hoarsely. “Tell me, and I shall do it. My
life is hers, and I would give the last drop of blood in my body for
her.” The Professor has a strongly humorous side, and I could from old
knowledge detect a trace of its origin in his answer:—
“My young sir, I do not ask so much as that—not the last!”
“What shall I do?” There was fire in his eyes, and his open nostril
quivered with intent. Van Helsing slapped him on the shoulder. “Come!”
he said. “You are a man, and it is a man we want. You are better than
me, better than my friend John.” Arthur looked bewildered, and the
Professor went on by explaining in a kindly way:—
“Young miss is bad, very bad. She wants blood, and blood she must have
or die. My friend John and I have consulted; and we are about to perform
what we call transfusion of blood—to transfer from full veins of one to
the empty veins which pine for him. John was to give his blood, as he is
the more young and strong than me”—here Arthur took my hand and wrung
it hard in silence—“but, now you are here, you are more good than us,
old or young, who toil much in the world of thought. Our nerves are not
so calm and our blood not so bright than yours!” Arthur turned to him
and said:—
“If you only knew how gladly I would die for her you would
understand——”
He stopped, with a sort of choke in his voice.
“Good boy!” said Van Helsing. “In the not-so-far-off you will be happy
that you have done all for her you love. Come now and be silent. You
shall kiss her once before it is done, but then you must go; and you
must leave at my sign. Say no word to Madame; you know how it is with
her! There must be no shock; any knowledge of this would be one. Come!”
We all went up to Lucy’s room. Arthur by direction remained outside.
Lucy turned her head and looked at us, but said nothing. She was not
asleep, but she was simply too weak to make the effort. Her eyes spoke
to us; that was all. Van Helsing took some things from his bag and laid
them on a little table out of sight. Then he mixed a narcotic, and
coming over to the bed, said cheerily:—
“Now, little miss, here is your medicine. Drink it off, like a good
child. See, I lift you so that to swallow is easy. Yes.” She had made
the effort with success.
It astonished me how long the drug took to act. This, in fact, marked
the extent of her weakness. The time seemed endless until sleep began to
flicker in her eyelids. At last, however, the narcotic began to manifest
its potency; and she fell into a deep sleep. When the Professor was
satisfied he called Arthur into the room, and bade him strip off his
coat. Then he added: “You may take that one little kiss whiles I bring
over the table. Friend John, help to me!” So neither of us looked whilst
he bent over her.
Van Helsing turning to me, said:
“He is so young and strong and of blood so pure that we need not
defibrinate it.”
Then with swiftness, but with absolute method, Van Helsing performed the
operation. As the transfusion went on something like life seemed to come
back to poor Lucy’s cheeks, and through Arthur’s growing pallor the joy
of his face seemed absolutely to shine. After a bit I began to grow
anxious, for the loss of blood was telling on Arthur, strong man as he
was. It gave me an idea of what a terrible strain Lucy’s system must
have undergone that what weakened Arthur only partially restored her.
But the Professor’s face was set, and he stood watch in hand and with
his eyes fixed now on the patient and now on Arthur. I could hear my own
heart beat. Presently he said in a soft voice: “Do not stir an instant.
It is enough. You attend him; I will look to her.” When all was over I
could see how much Arthur was weakened. I dressed the wound and took his
arm to bring him away, when Van Helsing spoke without turning round—the
man seems to have eyes in the back of his head:—
“The brave lover, I think, deserve another kiss, which he shall have
presently.” And as he had now finished his operation, he adjusted the
pillow to the patient’s head. As he did so the narrow black velvet band
which she seems always to wear round her throat, buckled with an old
diamond buckle which her lover had given her, was dragged a little up,
and showed a red mark on her throat. Arthur did not notice it, but I
could hear the deep hiss of indrawn breath which is one of Van Helsing’s
ways of betraying emotion. He said nothing at the moment, but turned to
me, saying: “Now take down our brave young lover, give him of the port
wine, and let him lie down a while. He must then go home and rest, sleep
much and eat much, that he may be recruited of what he has so given to
his love. He must not stay here. Hold! a moment. I may take it, sir,
that you are anxious of result. Then bring it with you that in all ways
the operation is successful. You have saved her life this time, and you
can go home and rest easy in mind that all that can be is. I shall tell
her all when she is well; she shall love you none the less for what you
have done. Good-bye.”
When Arthur had gone I went back to the room. Lucy was sleeping gently,
but her breathing was stronger; I could see the counterpane move as her
breast heaved. By the bedside sat Van Helsing, looking at her intently.
The velvet band again covered the red mark. I asked the Professor in a
whisper:—
“What do you make of that mark on her throat?”
“What do you make of it?”
“I have not examined it yet,” I answered, and then and there proceeded
to loose the band. Just over the external jugular vein there were two
punctures, not large, but not wholesome-looking. There was no sign of
disease, but the edges were white and worn-looking, as if by some
trituration. It at once occurred to me that this wound, or whatever it
was, might be the means of that manifest loss of blood; but I abandoned
the idea as soon as formed, for such a thing could not be. The whole bed
would have been drenched to a scarlet with the blood which the girl must
have lost to leave such a pallor as she had before the transfusion.
“Well?” said Van Helsing.
“Well,” said I, “I can make nothing of it.” The Professor stood up. “I
must go back to Amsterdam to-night,” he said. “There are books and
things there which I want. You must remain here all the night, and you
must not let your sight pass from her.”
“Shall I have a nurse?” I asked.
“We are the best nurses, you and I. You keep watch all night; see that
she is well fed, and that nothing disturbs her. You must not sleep all
the night. Later on we can sleep, you and I. I shall be back as soon as
possible. And then we may begin.”
“May begin?” I said. “What on earth do you mean?”
“We shall see!” he answered, as he hurried out. He came back a moment
later and put his head inside the door and said with warning finger held
up:—
“Remember, she is your charge. If you leave her, and harm befall, you
shall not sleep easy hereafter!”
Dr. Seward’s Diary—continued.
8 September.—I sat up all night with Lucy. The opiate worked itself
off towards dusk, and she waked naturally; she looked a different being
from what she had been before the operation. Her spirits even were good,
and she was full of a happy vivacity, but I could see evidences of the
absolute prostration which she had undergone. When I told Mrs. Westenra
that Dr. Van Helsing had directed that I should sit up with her she
almost pooh-poohed the idea, pointing out her daughter’s renewed
strength and excellent spirits. I was firm, however, and made
preparations for my long vigil. When her maid had prepared her for the
night I came in, having in the meantime had supper, and took a seat by
the bedside. She did not in any way make objection, but looked at me
gratefully whenever I caught her eye. After a long spell she seemed
sinking off to sleep, but with an effort seemed to pull herself together
and shook it off. This was repeated several times, with greater effort
and with shorter pauses as the time moved on. It was apparent that she
did not want to sleep, so I tackled the subject at once:—
“You do not want to go to sleep?”
“No; I am afraid.”
“Afraid to go to sleep! Why so? It is the boon we all crave for.”
“Ah, not if you were like me—if sleep was to you a presage of horror!”
“A presage of horror! What on earth do you mean?”
“I don’t know; oh, I don’t know. And that is what is so terrible. All
this weakness comes to me in sleep; until I dread the very thought.”
“But, my dear girl, you may sleep to-night. I am here watching you, and
I can promise that nothing will happen.”
“Ah, I can trust you!” I seized the opportunity, and said: “I promise
you that if I see any evidence of bad dreams I will wake you at once.”
“You will? Oh, will you really? How good you are to me. Then I will
sleep!” And almost at the word she gave a deep sigh of relief, and sank
back, asleep.
All night long I watched by her. She never stirred, but slept on and on
in a deep, tranquil, life-giving, health-giving sleep. Her lips were
slightly parted, and her breast rose and fell with the regularity of a
pendulum. There was a smile on her face, and it was evident that no bad
dreams had come to disturb her peace of mind.
In the early morning her maid came, and I left her in her care and took
myself back home, for I was anxious about many things. I sent a short
wire to Van Helsing and to Arthur, telling them of the excellent result
of the operation. My own work, with its manifold arrears, took me all
day to clear off; it was dark when I was able to inquire about my
zoöphagous patient. The report was good; he had been quite quiet for the
past day and night. A telegram came from Van Helsing at Amsterdam whilst
I was at dinner, suggesting that I should be at Hillingham to-night, as
it might be well to be at hand, and stating that he was leaving by the
night mail and would join me early in the morning.

9 September.—I was pretty tired and worn out when I got to
Hillingham. For two nights I had hardly had a wink of sleep, and my
brain was beginning to feel that numbness which marks cerebral
exhaustion. Lucy was up and in cheerful spirits. When she shook hands
with me she looked sharply in my face and said:—
“No sitting up to-night for you. You are worn out. I am quite well
again; indeed, I am; and if there is to be any sitting up, it is I who
will sit up with you.” I would not argue the point, but went and had my
supper. Lucy came with me, and, enlivened by her charming presence, I
made an excellent meal, and had a couple of glasses of the more than
excellent port. Then Lucy took me upstairs, and showed me a room next
her own, where a cozy fire was burning. “Now,” she said, “you must stay
here. I shall leave this door open and my door too. You can lie on the
sofa for I know that nothing would induce any of you doctors to go to
bed whilst there is a patient above the horizon. If I want anything I
shall call out, and you can come to me at once.” I could not but
acquiesce, for I was “dog-tired,” and could not have sat up had I tried.
So, on her renewing her promise to call me if she should want anything,
I lay on the sofa, and forgot all about everything.
Lucy Westenra’s Diary.
9 September.—I feel so happy to-night. I have been so miserably weak,
that to be able to think and move about is like feeling sunshine after
a long spell of east wind out of a steel sky. Somehow Arthur feels very,
very close to me. I seem to feel his presence warm about me. I suppose
it is that sickness and weakness are selfish things and turn our inner
eyes and sympathy on ourselves, whilst health and strength give Love
rein, and in thought and feeling he can wander where he wills. I know
where my thoughts are. If Arthur only knew! My dear, my dear, your ears
must tingle as you sleep, as mine do waking. Oh, the blissful rest of
last night! How I slept, with that dear, good Dr. Seward watching me.
And to-night I shall not fear to sleep, since he is close at hand and
within call. Thank everybody for being so good to me! Thank God!
Good-night, Arthur.
Dr. Seward’s Diary.
10 September.—I was conscious of the Professor’s hand on my head, and
started awake all in a second. That is one of the things that we learn
in an asylum, at any rate.
“And how is our patient?”
“Well, when I left her, or rather when she left me,” I answered.
“Come, let us see,” he said. And together we went into the room.
The blind was down, and I went over to raise it gently, whilst Van
Helsing stepped, with his soft, cat-like tread, over to the bed.
As I raised the blind, and the morning sunlight flooded the room, I
heard the Professor’s low hiss of inspiration, and knowing its rarity, a
deadly fear shot through my heart. As I passed over he moved back, and
his exclamation of horror, “Gott in Himmel!” needed no enforcement from
his agonised face. He raised his hand and pointed to the bed, and his
iron face was drawn and ashen white. I felt my knees begin to tremble.
There on the bed, seemingly in a swoon, lay poor Lucy, more horribly
white and wan-looking than ever. Even the lips were white, and the gums
seemed to have shrunken back from the teeth, as we sometimes see in a
corpse after a prolonged illness. Van Helsing raised his foot to stamp
in anger, but the instinct of his life and all the long years of habit
stood to him, and he put it down again softly. “Quick!” he said. “Bring
the brandy.” I flew to the dining-room, and returned with the decanter.
He wetted the poor white lips with it, and together we rubbed palm and
wrist and heart. He felt her heart, and after a few moments of agonising
suspense said:—
“It is not too late. It beats, though but feebly. All our work is
undone; we must begin again. There is no young Arthur here now; I have
to call on you yourself this time, friend John.” As he spoke, he was
dipping into his bag and producing the instruments for transfusion; I
had taken off my coat and rolled up my shirt-sleeve. There was no
possibility of an opiate just at present, and no need of one; and so,
without a moment’s delay, we began the operation. After a time—it did
not seem a short time either, for the draining away of one’s blood, no
matter how willingly it be given, is a terrible feeling—Van Helsing
held up a warning finger. “Do not stir,” he said, “but I fear that with
growing strength she may wake; and that would make danger, oh, so much
danger. But I shall precaution take. I shall give hypodermic injection
of morphia.” He proceeded then, swiftly and deftly, to carry out his
intent. The effect on Lucy was not bad, for the faint seemed to merge
subtly into the narcotic sleep. It was with a feeling of personal pride
that I could see a faint tinge of colour steal back into the pallid
cheeks and lips. No man knows, till he experiences it, what it is to
feel his own life-blood drawn away into the veins of the woman he loves.
The Professor watched me critically. “That will do,” he said. “Already?”
I remonstrated. “You took a great deal more from Art.” To which he
smiled a sad sort of smile as he replied:—
“He is her lover, her fiancé. You have work, much work, to do for her
and for others; and the present will suffice.”
When we stopped the operation, he attended to Lucy, whilst I applied
digital pressure to my own incision. I laid down, whilst I waited his
leisure to attend to me, for I felt faint and a little sick. By-and-by
he bound up my wound, and sent me downstairs to get a glass of wine for
myself. As I was leaving the room, he came after me, and half
whispered:—
“Mind, nothing must be said of this. If our young lover should turn up
unexpected, as before, no word to him. It would at once frighten him and
enjealous him, too. There must be none. So!”
When I came back he looked at me carefully, and then said:—
“You are not much the worse. Go into the room, and lie on your sofa, and
rest awhile; then have much breakfast, and come here to me.”
I followed out his orders, for I knew how right and wise they were. I
had done my part, and now my next duty was to keep up my strength. I
felt very weak, and in the weakness lost something of the amazement at
what had occurred. I fell asleep on the sofa, however, wondering over
and over again how Lucy had made such a retrograde movement, and how
she could have been drained of so much blood with no sign anywhere to
show for it. I think I must have continued my wonder in my dreams, for,
sleeping and waking, my thoughts always came back to the little
punctures in her throat and the ragged, exhausted appearance of their
edges—tiny though they were.
Lucy slept well into the day, and when she woke she was fairly well and
strong, though not nearly so much so as the day before. When Van Helsing
had seen her, he went out for a walk, leaving me in charge, with strict
injunctions that I was not to leave her for a moment. I could hear his
voice in the hall, asking the way to the nearest telegraph office.
Lucy chatted with me freely, and seemed quite unconscious that anything
had happened. I tried to keep her amused and interested. When her mother
came up to see her, she did not seem to notice any change whatever, but
said to me gratefully:—
“We owe you so much, Dr. Seward, for all you have done, but you really
must now take care not to overwork yourself. You are looking pale
yourself. You want a wife to nurse and look after you a bit; that you
do!” As she spoke, Lucy turned crimson, though it was only momentarily,
for her poor wasted veins could not stand for long such an unwonted
drain to the head. The reaction came in excessive pallor as she turned
imploring eyes on me. I smiled and nodded, and laid my finger on my
lips; with a sigh, she sank back amid her pillows.
Van Helsing returned in a couple of hours, and presently said to me:
“Now you go home, and eat much and drink enough. Make yourself strong. I
stay here to-night, and I shall sit up with little miss myself. You and
I must watch the case, and we must have none other to know. I have grave
reasons. No, do not ask them; think what you will. Do not fear to think
even the most not-probable. Good-night.”
In the hall two of the maids came to me, and asked if they or either of
them might not sit up with Miss Lucy. They implored me to let them; and
when I said it was Dr. Van Helsing’s wish that either he or I should sit
up, they asked me quite piteously to intercede with the “foreign
gentleman.” I was much touched by their kindness. Perhaps it is because
I am weak at present, and perhaps because it was on Lucy’s account, that
their devotion was manifested; for over and over again have I seen
similar instances of woman’s kindness. I got back here in time for a
late dinner; went my rounds—all well; and set this down whilst waiting
for sleep. It is coming.

11 September.—This afternoon I went over to Hillingham. Found Van
Helsing in excellent spirits, and Lucy much better. Shortly after I had
arrived, a big parcel from abroad came for the Professor. He opened it
with much impressment—assumed, of course—and showed a great bundle of
white flowers.
“These are for you, Miss Lucy,” he said.
“For me? Oh, Dr. Van Helsing!”
“Yes, my dear, but not for you to play with. These are medicines.” Here
Lucy made a wry face. “Nay, but they are not to take in a decoction or
in nauseous form, so you need not snub that so charming nose, or I shall
point out to my friend Arthur what woes he may have to endure in seeing
so much beauty that he so loves so much distort. Aha, my pretty miss,
that bring the so nice nose all straight again. This is medicinal, but
you do not know how. I put him in your window, I make pretty wreath, and
hang him round your neck, so that you sleep well. Oh yes! they, like the
lotus flower, make your trouble forgotten. It smell so like the waters
of Lethe, and of that fountain of youth that the Conquistadores sought
for in the Floridas, and find him all too late.”
Whilst he was speaking, Lucy had been examining the flowers and smelling
them. Now she threw them down, saying, with half-laughter, and
half-disgust:—
“Oh, Professor, I believe you are only putting up a joke on me. Why,
these flowers are only common garlic.”
To my surprise, Van Helsing rose up and said with all his sternness, his
iron jaw set and his bushy eyebrows meeting:—
“No trifling with me! I never jest! There is grim purpose in all I do;
and I warn you that you do not thwart me. Take care, for the sake of
others if not for your own.” Then seeing poor Lucy scared, as she might
well be, he went on more gently: “Oh, little miss, my dear, do not fear
me. I only do for your good; but there is much virtue to you in those so
common flowers. See, I place them myself in your room. I make myself the
wreath that you are to wear. But hush! no telling to others that make so
inquisitive questions. We must obey, and silence is a part of obedience;
and obedience is to bring you strong and well into loving arms that wait
for you. Now sit still awhile. Come with me, friend John, and you shall
help me deck the room with my garlic, which is all the way from Haarlem,
where my friend Vanderpool raise herb in his glass-houses all the year.
I had to telegraph yesterday, or they would not have been here.”
We went into the room, taking the flowers with us. The Professor’s
actions were certainly odd and not to be found in any pharmacopœia
that I ever heard of. First he fastened up the windows and latched them
securely; next, taking a handful of the flowers, he rubbed them all over
the sashes, as though to ensure that every whiff of air that might get
in would be laden with the garlic smell. Then with the wisp he rubbed
all over the jamb of the door, above, below, and at each side, and round
the fireplace in the same way. It all seemed grotesque to me, and
presently I said:—
“Well, Professor, I know you always have a reason for what you do, but
this certainly puzzles me. It is well we have no sceptic here, or he
would say that you were working some spell to keep out an evil spirit.”
“Perhaps I am!” he answered quietly as he began to make the wreath which
Lucy was to wear round her neck.
We then waited whilst Lucy made her toilet for the night, and when she
was in bed he came and himself fixed the wreath of garlic round her
neck. The last words he said to her were:—
“Take care you do not disturb it; and even if the room feel close, do
not to-night open the window or the door.”
“I promise,” said Lucy, “and thank you both a thousand times for all
your kindness to me! Oh, what have I done to be blessed with such
friends?”
As we left the house in my fly, which was waiting, Van Helsing said:—
“To-night I can sleep in peace, and sleep I want—two nights of travel,
much reading in the day between, and much anxiety on the day to follow,
and a night to sit up, without to wink. To-morrow in the morning early
you call for me, and we come together to see our pretty miss, so much
more strong for my ‘spell’ which I have work. Ho! ho!”
He seemed so confident that I, remembering my own confidence two nights
before and with the baneful result, felt awe and vague terror. It must
have been my weakness that made me hesitate to tell it to my friend, but
I felt it all the more, like unshed tears.
Lucy Westenra’s Diary.
12 September.—How good they all are to me. I quite love that dear Dr.
Van Helsing. I wonder why he was so anxious about these flowers. He
positively frightened me, he was so fierce. And yet he must have been
right, for I feel comfort from them already. Somehow, I do not dread
being alone to-night, and I can go to sleep without fear. I shall not
mind any flapping outside the window. Oh, the terrible struggle that I
have had against sleep so often of late; the pain of the sleeplessness,
or the pain of the fear of sleep, with such unknown horrors as it has
for me! How blessed are some people, whose lives have no fears, no
dreads; to whom sleep is a blessing that comes nightly, and brings
nothing but sweet dreams. Well, here I am to-night, hoping for sleep,
and lying like Ophelia in the play, with “virgin crants and maiden
strewments.” I never liked garlic before, but to-night it is delightful!
There is peace in its smell; I feel sleep coming already. Good-night,
everybody.
Dr. Seward’s Diary.
13 September.—Called at the Berkeley and found Van Helsing, as usual,
up to time. The carriage ordered from the hotel was waiting. The
Professor took his bag, which he always brings with him now.
Let all be put down exactly. Van Helsing and I arrived at Hillingham at
eight o’clock. It was a lovely morning; the bright sunshine and all the
fresh feeling of early autumn seemed like the completion of nature’s
annual work. The leaves were turning to all kinds of beautiful colours,
but had not yet begun to drop from the trees. When we entered we met
Mrs. Westenra coming out of the morning room. She is always an early
riser. She greeted us warmly and said:—
“You will be glad to know that Lucy is better. The dear child is still
asleep. I looked into her room and saw her, but did not go in, lest I
should disturb her.” The Professor smiled, and looked quite jubilant. He
rubbed his hands together, and said:—
“Aha! I thought I had diagnosed the case. My treatment is working,” to
which she answered:—
“You must not take all the credit to yourself, doctor. Lucy’s state this
morning is due in part to me.”
“How you do mean, ma’am?” asked the Professor.
“Well, I was anxious about the dear child in the night, and went into
her room. She was sleeping soundly—so soundly that even my coming did
not wake her. But the room was awfully stuffy. There were a lot of those
horrible, strong-smelling flowers about everywhere, and she had actually
a bunch of them round her neck. I feared that the heavy odour would be
too much for the dear child in her weak state, so I took them all away
and opened a bit of the window to let in a little fresh air. You will be
pleased with her, I am sure.”
She moved off into her boudoir, where she usually breakfasted early. As
she had spoken, I watched the Professor’s face, and saw it turn ashen
grey. He had been able to retain his self-command whilst the poor lady
was present, for he knew her state and how mischievous a shock would be;
he actually smiled on her as he held open the door for her to pass into
her room. But the instant she had disappeared he pulled me, suddenly and
forcibly, into the dining-room and closed the door.
Then, for the first time in my life, I saw Van Helsing break down. He
raised his hands over his head in a sort of mute despair, and then beat
his palms together in a helpless way; finally he sat down on a chair,
and putting his hands before his face, began to sob, with loud, dry sobs
that seemed to come from the very racking of his heart. Then he raised
his arms again, as though appealing to the whole universe. “God! God!
God!” he said. “What have we done, what has this poor thing done, that
we are so sore beset? Is there fate amongst us still, sent down from the
pagan world of old, that such things must be, and in such way? This poor
mother, all unknowing, and all for the best as she think, does such
thing as lose her daughter body and soul; and we must not tell her, we
must not even warn her, or she die, and then both die. Oh, how we are
beset! How are all the powers of the devils against us!” Suddenly he
jumped to his feet. “Come,” he said, “come, we must see and act. Devils
or no devils, or all the devils at once, it matters not; we fight him
all the same.” He went to the hall-door for his bag; and together we
went up to Lucy’s room.
Once again I drew up the blind, whilst Van Helsing went towards the bed.
This time he did not start as he looked on the poor face with the same
awful, waxen pallor as before. He wore a look of stern sadness and
infinite pity.
“As I expected,” he murmured, with that hissing inspiration of his which
meant so much. Without a word he went and locked the door, and then
began to set out on the little table the instruments for yet another
operation of transfusion of blood. I had long ago recognised the
necessity, and begun to take off my coat, but he stopped me with a
warning hand. “No!” he said. “To-day you must operate. I shall provide.
You are weakened already.” As he spoke he took off his coat and rolled
up his shirt-sleeve.
Again the operation; again the narcotic; again some return of colour to
the ashy cheeks, and the regular breathing of healthy sleep. This time I
watched whilst Van Helsing recruited himself and rested.
Presently he took an opportunity of telling Mrs. Westenra that she must
not remove anything from Lucy’s room without consulting him; that the
flowers were of medicinal value, and that the breathing of their odour
was a part of the system of cure. Then he took over the care of the case
himself, saying that he would watch this night and the next and would
send me word when to come.
After another hour Lucy waked from her sleep, fresh and bright and
seemingly not much the worse for her terrible ordeal.
What does it all mean? I am beginning to wonder if my long habit of life
amongst the insane is beginning to tell upon my own brain.
Lucy Westenra’s Diary.
17 September.—Four days and nights of peace. I am getting so strong
again that I hardly know myself. It is as if I had passed through some
long nightmare, and had just awakened to see the beautiful sunshine and
feel the fresh air of the morning around me. I have a dim
half-remembrance of long, anxious times of waiting and fearing; darkness
in which there was not even the pain of hope to make present distress
more poignant: and then long spells of oblivion, and the rising back to
life as a diver coming up through a great press of water. Since,
however, Dr. Van Helsing has been with me, all this bad dreaming seems
to have passed away; the noises that used to frighten me out of my
wits—the flapping against the windows, the distant voices which seemed
so close to me, the harsh sounds that came from I know not where and
commanded me to do I know not what—have all ceased. I go to bed now
without any fear of sleep. I do not even try to keep awake. I have grown
quite fond of the garlic, and a boxful arrives for me every day from
Haarlem. To-night Dr. Van Helsing is going away, as he has to be for a
day in Amsterdam. But I need not be watched; I am well enough to be left
alone. Thank God for mother’s sake, and dear Arthur’s, and for all our
friends who have been so kind! I shall not even feel the change, for
last night Dr. Van Helsing slept in his chair a lot of the time. I found
him asleep twice when I awoke; but I did not fear to go to sleep again,
although the boughs or bats or something napped almost angrily against
the window-panes.
“The Pall Mall Gazette,” 18 September.
THE ESCAPED WOLF.

PERILOUS ADVENTURE OF OUR INTERVIEWER.
Interview with the Keeper in the Zoölogical Gardens.
After many inquiries and almost as many refusals, and perpetually using
the words “Pall Mall Gazette” as a sort of talisman, I managed to find
the keeper of the section of the Zoölogical Gardens in which the wolf
department is included. Thomas Bilder lives in one of the cottages in
the enclosure behind the elephant-house, and was just sitting down to
his tea when I found him. Thomas and his wife are hospitable folk,
elderly, and without children, and if the specimen I enjoyed of their
hospitality be of the average kind, their lives must be pretty
comfortable. The keeper would not enter on what he called “business”
until the supper was over, and we were all satisfied. Then when the
table was cleared, and he had lit his pipe, he said:—
“Now, sir, you can go on and arsk me what you want. You’ll excoose me
refoosin’ to talk of perfeshunal subjects afore meals. I gives the
wolves and the jackals and the hyenas in all our section their tea afore
I begins to arsk them questions.”
“How do you mean, ask them questions?” I queried, wishful to get him
into a talkative humour.
“’Ittin’ of them over the ’ead with a pole is one way; scratchin’ of
their hears is another, when gents as is flush wants a bit of a show-orf
to their gals. I don’t so much mind the fust—the ’ittin’ with a pole
afore I chucks in their dinner; but I waits till they’ve ’ad their
sherry and kawffee, so to speak, afore I tries on with the
ear-scratchin’. Mind you,” he added philosophically, “there’s a deal of
the same nature in us as in them theer animiles. Here’s you a-comin’ and
arskin’ of me questions about my business, and I that grumpy-like that
only for your bloomin’ ’arf-quid I’d ’a’ seen you blowed fust ’fore I’d
answer. Not even when you arsked me sarcastic-like if I’d like you to
arsk the Superintendent if you might arsk me questions. Without offence
did I tell yer to go to ’ell?”
“You did.”
“An’ when you said you’d report me for usin’ of obscene language that
was ’ittin’ me over the ’ead; but the ’arf-quid made that all right. I
weren’t a-goin’ to fight, so I waited for the food, and did with my ’owl
as the wolves, and lions, and tigers does. But, Lor’ love yer ’art, now
that the old ’ooman has stuck a chunk of her tea-cake in me, an’ rinsed
me out with her bloomin’ old teapot, and I’ve lit hup, you may scratch
my ears for all you’re worth, and won’t git even a growl out of me.
Drive along with your questions. I know what yer a-comin’ at, that ’ere
escaped wolf.”
“Exactly. I want you to give me your view of it. Just tell me how it
happened; and when I know the facts I’ll get you to say what you
consider was the cause of it, and how you think the whole affair will
end.”
“All right, guv’nor. This ’ere is about the ’ole story. That ’ere wolf
what we called Bersicker was one of three grey ones that came from
Norway to Jamrach’s, which we bought off him four years ago. He was a
nice well-behaved wolf, that never gave no trouble to talk of. I’m more
surprised at ’im for wantin’ to get out nor any other animile in the
place. But, there, you can’t trust wolves no more nor women.”
“Don’t you mind him, sir!” broke in Mrs. Tom, with a cheery laugh. “’E’s
got mindin’ the animiles so long that blest if he ain’t like a old wolf
’isself! But there ain’t no ’arm in ’im.”
“Well, sir, it was about two hours after feedin’ yesterday when I first
hear my disturbance. I was makin’ up a litter in the monkey-house for a
young puma which is ill; but when I heard the yelpin’ and ’owlin’ I kem
away straight. There was Bersicker a-tearin’ like a mad thing at the
bars as if he wanted to get out. There wasn’t much people about that
day, and close at hand was only one man, a tall, thin chap, with a ’ook
nose and a pointed beard, with a few white hairs runnin’ through it. He
had a ’ard, cold look and red eyes, and I took a sort of mislike to him,
for it seemed as if it was ’im as they was hirritated at. He ’ad white
kid gloves on ’is ’ands, and he pointed out the animiles to me and says:
‘Keeper, these wolves seem upset at something.’
“‘Maybe it’s you,’ says I, for I did not like the airs as he give
’isself. He didn’t git angry, as I ’oped he would, but he smiled a kind
of insolent smile, with a mouth full of white, sharp teeth. ‘Oh no, they
wouldn’t like me,’ ’e says.
“‘Ow yes, they would,’ says I, a-imitatin’ of him. ‘They always likes a
bone or two to clean their teeth on about tea-time, which you ’as a
bagful.’
“Well, it was a odd thing, but when the animiles see us a-talkin’ they
lay down, and when I went over to Bersicker he let me stroke his ears
same as ever. That there man kem over, and blessed but if he didn’t put
in his hand and stroke the old wolf’s ears too!
“‘Tyke care,’ says I. ‘Bersicker is quick.’
“‘Never mind,’ he says. ‘I’m used to ’em!’
“‘Are you in the business yourself?’ I says, tyking off my ’at, for a
man what trades in wolves, anceterer, is a good friend to keepers.
“‘No,’ says he, ‘not exactly in the business, but I ’ave made pets of
several.’ And with that he lifts his ’at as perlite as a lord, and walks
away. Old Bersicker kep’ a-lookin’ arter ’im till ’e was out of sight,
and then went and lay down in a corner and wouldn’t come hout the ’ole
hevening. Well, larst night, so soon as the moon was hup, the wolves
here all began a-’owling. There warn’t nothing for them to ’owl at.
There warn’t no one near, except some one that was evidently a-callin’ a
dog somewheres out back of the gardings in the Park road. Once or twice
I went out to see that all was right, and it was, and then the ’owling
stopped. Just before twelve o’clock I just took a look round afore
turnin’ in, an’, bust me, but when I kem opposite to old Bersicker’s
cage I see the rails broken and twisted about and the cage empty. And
that’s all I know for certing.”
“Did any one else see anything?”
“One of our gard’ners was a-comin’ ’ome about that time from a ’armony,
when he sees a big grey dog comin’ out through the garding ’edges. At
least, so he says, but I don’t give much for it myself, for if he did ’e
never said a word about it to his missis when ’e got ’ome, and it was
only after the escape of the wolf was made known, and we had been up all
night-a-huntin’ of the Park for Bersicker, that he remembered seein’
anything. My own belief was that the ’armony ’ad got into his ’ead.”
“Now, Mr. Bilder, can you account in any way for the escape of the
wolf?”
“Well, sir,” he said, with a suspicious sort of modesty, “I think I can;
but I don’t know as ’ow you’d be satisfied with the theory.”
“Certainly I shall. If a man like you, who knows the animals from
experience, can’t hazard a good guess at any rate, who is even to try?”
“Well then, sir, I accounts for it this way; it seems to me that ’ere
wolf escaped—simply because he wanted to get out.”
From the hearty way that both Thomas and his wife laughed at the joke I
could see that it had done service before, and that the whole
explanation was simply an elaborate sell. I couldn’t cope in badinage
with the worthy Thomas, but I thought I knew a surer way to his heart,
so I said:—
“Now, Mr. Bilder, we’ll consider that first half-sovereign worked off,
and this brother of his is waiting to be claimed when you’ve told me
what you think will happen.”
“Right y’are, sir,” he said briskly. “Ye’ll excoose me, I know, for
a-chaffin’ of ye, but the old woman here winked at me, which was as much
as telling me to go on.”
“Well, I never!” said the old lady.
“My opinion is this: that ’ere wolf is a-’idin’ of, somewheres. The
gard’ner wot didn’t remember said he was a-gallopin’ northward faster
than a horse could go; but I don’t believe him, for, yer see, sir,
wolves don’t gallop no more nor dogs does, they not bein’ built that
way. Wolves is fine things in a storybook, and I dessay when they gets
in packs and does be chivyin’ somethin’ that’s more afeared than they is
they can make a devil of a noise and chop it up, whatever it is. But,
Lor’ bless you, in real life a wolf is only a low creature, not half so
clever or bold as a good dog; and not half a quarter so much fight in
’im. This one ain’t been used to fightin’ or even to providin’ for
hisself, and more like he’s somewhere round the Park a-’idin’ an’
a-shiverin’ of, and, if he thinks at all, wonderin’ where he is to get
his breakfast from; or maybe he’s got down some area and is in a
coal-cellar. My eye, won’t some cook get a rum start when she sees his
green eyes a-shining at her out of the dark! If he can’t get food he’s
bound to look for it, and mayhap he may chance to light on a butcher’s
shop in time. If he doesn’t, and some nursemaid goes a-walkin’ orf with
a soldier, leavin’ of the hinfant in the perambulator—well, then I
shouldn’t be surprised if the census is one babby the less. That’s
all.”
I was handing him the half-sovereign, when something came bobbing up
against the window, and Mr. Bilder’s face doubled its natural length
with surprise.
“God bless me!” he said. “If there ain’t old Bersicker come back by
’isself!”
He went to the door and opened it; a most unnecessary proceeding it
seemed to me. I have always thought that a wild animal never looks so
well as when some obstacle of pronounced durability is between us; a
personal experience has intensified rather than diminished that idea.
After all, however, there is nothing like custom, for neither Bilder nor
his wife thought any more of the wolf than I should of a dog. The animal
itself was as peaceful and well-behaved as that father of all
picture-wolves—Red Riding Hood’s quondam friend, whilst moving her
confidence in masquerade.
The whole scene was an unutterable mixture of comedy and pathos. The
wicked wolf that for half a day had paralysed London and set all the
children in the town shivering in their shoes, was there in a sort of
penitent mood, and was received and petted like a sort of vulpine
prodigal son. Old Bilder examined him all over with most tender
solicitude, and when he had finished with his penitent said:—
“There, I knew the poor old chap would get into some kind of trouble;
didn’t I say it all along? Here’s his head all cut and full of broken
glass. ’E’s been a-gettin’ over some bloomin’ wall or other. It’s a
shyme that people are allowed to top their walls with broken bottles.
This ’ere’s what comes of it. Come along, Bersicker.”
He took the wolf and locked him up in a cage, with a piece of meat that
satisfied, in quantity at any rate, the elementary conditions of the
fatted calf, and went off to report.
I came off, too, to report the only exclusive information that is given
to-day regarding the strange escapade at the Zoo.
Dr. Seward’s Diary.
17 September.—I was engaged after dinner in my study posting up my
books, which, through press of other work and the many visits to Lucy,
had fallen sadly into arrear. Suddenly the door was burst open, and in
rushed my patient, with his face distorted with passion. I was
thunderstruck, for such a thing as a patient getting of his own accord
into the Superintendent’s study is almost unknown. Without an instant’s
pause he made straight at me. He had a dinner-knife in his hand, and,
as I saw he was dangerous, I tried to keep the table between us. He was
too quick and too strong for me, however; for before I could get my
balance he had struck at me and cut my left wrist rather severely.
Before he could strike again, however, I got in my right and he was
sprawling on his back on the floor. My wrist bled freely, and quite a
little pool trickled on to the carpet. I saw that my friend was not
intent on further effort, and occupied myself binding up my wrist,
keeping a wary eye on the prostrate figure all the time. When the
attendants rushed in, and we turned our attention to him, his employment
positively sickened me. He was lying on his belly on the floor licking
up, like a dog, the blood which had fallen from my wounded wrist. He was
easily secured, and, to my surprise, went with the attendants quite
placidly, simply repeating over and over again: “The blood is the life!
The blood is the life!”
I cannot afford to lose blood just at present; I have lost too much of
late for my physical good, and then the prolonged strain of Lucy’s
illness and its horrible phases is telling on me. I am over-excited and
weary, and I need rest, rest, rest. Happily Van Helsing has not summoned
me, so I need not forego my sleep; to-night I could not well do without
it.
Telegram, Van Helsing, Antwerp, to Seward, Carfax.
(Sent to Carfax, Sussex, as no county given; delivered late by
twenty-two hours.)
“17 September.—Do not fail to be at Hillingham to-night. If not
watching all the time frequently, visit and see that flowers are as
placed; very important; do not fail. Shall be with you as soon as
possible after arrival.”
Dr. Seward’s Diary.
18 September.—Just off for train to London. The arrival of Van
Helsing’s telegram filled me with dismay. A whole night lost, and I know
by bitter experience what may happen in a night. Of course it is
possible that all may be well, but what may have happened? Surely
there is some horrible doom hanging over us that every possible accident
should thwart us in all we try to do. I shall take this cylinder with
me, and then I can complete my entry on Lucy’s phonograph.
Memorandum left by Lucy Westenra.
17 September. Night.—I write this and leave it to be seen, so that no
one may by any chance get into trouble through me. This is an exact
record of what took place to-night. I feel I am dying of weakness, and
have barely strength to write, but it must be done if I die in the
doing.
I went to bed as usual, taking care that the flowers were placed as Dr.
Van Helsing directed, and soon fell asleep.
I was waked by the flapping at the window, which had begun after that
sleep-walking on the cliff at Whitby when Mina saved me, and which now I
know so well. I was not afraid, but I did wish that Dr. Seward was in
the next room—as Dr. Van Helsing said he would be—so that I might have
called him. I tried to go to sleep, but could not. Then there came to me
the old fear of sleep, and I determined to keep awake. Perversely sleep
would try to come then when I did not want it; so, as I feared to be
alone, I opened my door and called out: “Is there anybody there?” There
was no answer. I was afraid to wake mother, and so closed my door again.
Then outside in the shrubbery I heard a sort of howl like a dog’s, but
more fierce and deeper. I went to the window and looked out, but could
see nothing, except a big bat, which had evidently been buffeting its
wings against the window. So I went back to bed again, but determined
not to go to sleep. Presently the door opened, and mother looked in;
seeing by my moving that I was not asleep, came in, and sat by me. She
said to me even more sweetly and softly than her wont:—
“I was uneasy about you, darling, and came in to see that you were all
right.”
I feared she might catch cold sitting there, and asked her to come in
and sleep with me, so she came into bed, and lay down beside me; she did
not take off her dressing gown, for she said she would only stay a while
and then go back to her own bed. As she lay there in my arms, and I in
hers, the flapping and buffeting came to the window again. She was
startled and a little frightened, and cried out: “What is that?” I tried
to pacify her, and at last succeeded, and she lay quiet; but I could
hear her poor dear heart still beating terribly. After a while there was
the low howl again out in the shrubbery, and shortly after there was a
crash at the window, and a lot of broken glass was hurled on the floor.
The window blind blew back with the wind that rushed in, and in the
aperture of the broken panes there was the head of a great, gaunt grey
wolf. Mother cried out in a fright, and struggled up into a sitting
posture, and clutched wildly at anything that would help her. Amongst
other things, she clutched the wreath of flowers that Dr. Van Helsing
insisted on my wearing round my neck, and tore it away from me. For a
second or two she sat up, pointing at the wolf, and there was a strange
and horrible gurgling in her throat; then she fell over—as if struck
with lightning, and her head hit my forehead and made me dizzy for a
moment or two. The room and all round seemed to spin round. I kept my
eyes fixed on the window, but the wolf drew his head back, and a whole
myriad of little specks seemed to come blowing in through the broken
window, and wheeling and circling round like the pillar of dust that
travellers describe when there is a simoon in the desert. I tried to
stir, but there was some spell upon me, and dear mother’s poor body,
which seemed to grow cold already—for her dear heart had ceased to
beat—weighed me down; and I remembered no more for a while.
The time did not seem long, but very, very awful, till I recovered
consciousness again. Somewhere near, a passing bell was tolling; the
dogs all round the neighbourhood were howling; and in our shrubbery,
seemingly just outside, a nightingale was singing. I was dazed and
stupid with pain and terror and weakness, but the sound of the
nightingale seemed like the voice of my dead mother come back to comfort
me. The sounds seemed to have awakened the maids, too, for I could hear
their bare feet pattering outside my door. I called to them, and they
came in, and when they saw what had happened, and what it was that lay
over me on the bed, they screamed out. The wind rushed in through the
broken window, and the door slammed to. They lifted off the body of my
dear mother, and laid her, covered up with a sheet, on the bed after I
had got up. They were all so frightened and nervous that I directed them
to go to the dining-room and have each a glass of wine. The door flew
open for an instant and closed again. The maids shrieked, and then went
in a body to the dining-room; and I laid what flowers I had on my dear
mother’s breast. When they were there I remembered what Dr. Van Helsing
had told me, but I didn’t like to remove them, and, besides, I would
have some of the servants to sit up with me now. I was surprised that
the maids did not come back. I called them, but got no answer, so I went
to the dining-room to look for them.
My heart sank when I saw what had happened. They all four lay helpless
on the floor, breathing heavily. The decanter of sherry was on the table
half full, but there was a queer, acrid smell about. I was suspicious,
and examined the decanter. It smelt of laudanum, and looking on the
sideboard, I found that the bottle which mother’s doctor uses for
her—oh! did use—was empty. What am I to do? what am I to do? I am back
in the room with mother. I cannot leave her, and I am alone, save for
the sleeping servants, whom some one has drugged. Alone with the dead! I
dare not go out, for I can hear the low howl of the wolf through the
broken window.
The air seems full of specks, floating and circling in the draught from
the window, and the lights burn blue and dim. What am I to do? God
shield me from harm this night! I shall hide this paper in my breast,
where they shall find it when they come to lay me out. My dear mother
gone! It is time that I go too. Good-bye, dear Arthur, if I should not
survive this night. God keep you, dear, and God help me!
18 September.—I drove at once to Hillingham and arrived early.
Keeping my cab at the gate, I went up the avenue alone. I knocked gently
and rang as quietly as possible, for I feared to disturb Lucy or her
mother, and hoped to only bring a servant to the door. After a while,
finding no response, I knocked and rang again; still no answer. I cursed
the laziness of the servants that they should lie abed at such an
hour—for it was now ten o’clock—and so rang and knocked again, but
more impatiently, but still without response. Hitherto I had blamed only
the servants, but now a terrible fear began to assail me. Was this
desolation but another link in the chain of doom which seemed drawing
tight around us? Was it indeed a house of death to which I had come, too
late? I knew that minutes, even seconds of delay, might mean hours of
danger to Lucy, if she had had again one of those frightful relapses;
and I went round the house to try if I could find by chance an entry
anywhere.
I could find no means of ingress. Every window and door was fastened and
locked, and I returned baffled to the porch. As I did so, I heard the
rapid pit-pat of a swiftly driven horse’s feet. They stopped at the
gate, and a few seconds later I met Van Helsing running up the avenue.
When he saw me, he gasped out:—
“Then it was you, and just arrived. How is she? Are we too late? Did you
not get my telegram?”
I answered as quickly and coherently as I could that I had only got his
telegram early in the morning, and had not lost a minute in coming here,
and that I could not make any one in the house hear me. He paused and
raised his hat as he said solemnly:—
“Then I fear we are too late. God’s will be done!” With his usual
recuperative energy, he went on: “Come. If there be no way open to get
in, we must make one. Time is all in all to us now.”
We went round to the back of the house, where there was a kitchen
window. The Professor took a small surgical saw from his case, and
handing it to me, pointed to the iron bars which guarded the window. I
attacked them at once and had very soon cut through three of them. Then
with a long, thin knife we pushed back the fastening of the sashes and
opened the window. I helped the Professor in, and followed him. There
was no one in the kitchen or in the servants’ rooms, which were close at
hand. We tried all the rooms as we went along, and in the dining-room,
dimly lit by rays of light through the shutters, found four
servant-women lying on the floor. There was no need to think them dead,
for their stertorous breathing and the acrid smell of laudanum in the
room left no doubt as to their condition. Van Helsing and I looked at
each other, and as we moved away he said: “We can attend to them later.”
Then we ascended to Lucy’s room. For an instant or two we paused at the
door to listen, but there was no sound that we could hear. With white
faces and trembling hands, we opened the door gently, and entered the
room.
How shall I describe what we saw? On the bed lay two women, Lucy and her
mother. The latter lay farthest in, and she was covered with a white
sheet, the edge of which had been blown back by the draught through the
broken window, showing the drawn, white face, with a look of terror
fixed upon it. By her side lay Lucy, with face white and still more
drawn. The flowers which had been round her neck we found upon her
mother’s bosom, and her throat was bare, showing the two little wounds
which we had noticed before, but looking horribly white and mangled.
Without a word the Professor bent over the bed, his head almost touching
poor Lucy’s breast; then he gave a quick turn of his head, as of one who
listens, and leaping to his feet, he cried out to me:—
“It is not yet too late! Quick! quick! Bring the brandy!”
I flew downstairs and returned with it, taking care to smell and taste
it, lest it, too, were drugged like the decanter of sherry which I found
on the table. The maids were still breathing, but more restlessly, and I
fancied that the narcotic was wearing off. I did not stay to make sure,
but returned to Van Helsing. He rubbed the brandy, as on another
occasion, on her lips and gums and on her wrists and the palms of her
hands. He said to me:—
“I can do this, all that can be at the present. You go wake those maids.
Flick them in the face with a wet towel, and flick them hard. Make them
get heat and fire and a warm bath. This poor soul is nearly as cold as
that beside her. She will need be heated before we can do anything
more.”
I went at once, and found little difficulty in waking three of the
women. The fourth was only a young girl, and the drug had evidently
affected her more strongly, so I lifted her on the sofa and let her
sleep. The others were dazed at first, but as remembrance came back to
them they cried and sobbed in a hysterical manner. I was stern with
them, however, and would not let them talk. I told them that one life
was bad enough to lose, and that if they delayed they would sacrifice
Miss Lucy. So, sobbing and crying, they went about their way, half clad
as they were, and prepared fire and water. Fortunately, the kitchen and
boiler fires were still alive, and there was no lack of hot water. We
got a bath and carried Lucy out as she was and placed her in it. Whilst
we were busy chafing her limbs there was a knock at the hall door. One
of the maids ran off, hurried on some more clothes, and opened it. Then
she returned and whispered to us that there was a gentleman who had come
with a message from Mr. Holmwood. I bade her simply tell him that he
must wait, for we could see no one now. She went away with the message,
and, engrossed with our work, I clean forgot all about him.
I never saw in all my experience the Professor work in such deadly
earnest. I knew—as he knew—that it was a stand-up fight with death,
and in a pause told him so. He answered me in a way that I did not
understand, but with the sternest look that his face could wear:—
“If that were all, I would stop here where we are now, and let her fade
away into peace, for I see no light in life over her horizon.” He went
on with his work with, if possible, renewed and more frenzied vigour.
Presently we both began to be conscious that the heat was beginning to
be of some effect. Lucy’s heart beat a trifle more audibly to the
stethoscope, and her lungs had a perceptible movement. Van Helsing’s
face almost beamed, and as we lifted her from the bath and rolled her in
a hot sheet to dry her he said to me:—
“The first gain is ours! Check to the King!”
We took Lucy into another room, which had by now been prepared, and laid
her in bed and forced a few drops of brandy down her throat. I noticed
that Van Helsing tied a soft silk handkerchief round her throat. She was
still unconscious, and was quite as bad as, if not worse than, we had
ever seen her.
Van Helsing called in one of the women, and told her to stay with her
and not to take her eyes off her till we returned, and then beckoned me
out of the room.
“We must consult as to what is to be done,” he said as we descended the
stairs. In the hall he opened the dining-room door, and we passed in, he
closing the door carefully behind him. The shutters had been opened, but
the blinds were already down, with that obedience to the etiquette of
death which the British woman of the lower classes always rigidly
observes. The room was, therefore, dimly dark. It was, however, light
enough for our purposes. Van Helsing’s sternness was somewhat relieved
by a look of perplexity. He was evidently torturing his mind about
something, so I waited for an instant, and he spoke:—
“What are we to do now? Where are we to turn for help? We must have
another transfusion of blood, and that soon, or that poor girl’s life
won’t be worth an hour’s purchase. You are exhausted already; I am
exhausted too. I fear to trust those women, even if they would have
courage to submit. What are we to do for some one who will open his
veins for her?”
“What’s the matter with me, anyhow?”
The voice came from the sofa across the room, and its tones brought
relief and joy to my heart, for they were those of Quincey Morris. Van
Helsing started angrily at the first sound, but his face softened and a
glad look came into his eyes as I cried out: “Quincey Morris!” and
rushed towards him with outstretched hands.
“What brought you here?” I cried as our hands met.
“I guess Art is the cause.”
He handed me a telegram:—
“Have not heard from Seward for three days, and am terribly anxious.
Cannot leave. Father still in same condition. Send me word how Lucy is.
Do not delay.—Holmwood.”
“I think I came just in the nick of time. You know you have only to tell
me what to do.”
Van Helsing strode forward, and took his hand, looking him straight in
the eyes as he said:—
“A brave man’s blood is the best thing on this earth when a woman is in
trouble. You’re a man and no mistake. Well, the devil may work against
us for all he’s worth, but God sends us men when we want them.”
Once again we went through that ghastly operation. I have not the heart
to go through with the details. Lucy had got a terrible shock and it
told on her more than before, for though plenty of blood went into her
veins, her body did not respond to the treatment as well as on the other
occasions. Her struggle back into life was something frightful to see
and hear. However, the action of both heart and lungs improved, and Van
Helsing made a subcutaneous injection of morphia, as before, and with
good effect. Her faint became a profound slumber. The Professor watched
whilst I went downstairs with Quincey Morris, and sent one of the maids
to pay off one of the cabmen who were waiting. I left Quincey lying down
after having a glass of wine, and told the cook to get ready a good
breakfast. Then a thought struck me, and I went back to the room where
Lucy now was. When I came softly in, I found Van Helsing with a sheet or
two of note-paper in his hand. He had evidently read it, and was
thinking it over as he sat with his hand to his brow. There was a look
of grim satisfaction in his face, as of one who has had a doubt solved.
He handed me the paper saying only: “It dropped from Lucy’s breast when
we carried her to the bath.”
When I had read it, I stood looking at the Professor, and after a pause
asked him: “In God’s name, what does it all mean? Was she, or is she,
mad; or what sort of horrible danger is it?” I was so bewildered that I
did not know what to say more. Van Helsing put out his hand and took the
paper, saying:—
“Do not trouble about it now. Forget it for the present. You shall know
and understand it all in good time; but it will be later. And now what
is it that you came to me to say?” This brought me back to fact, and I
was all myself again.
“I came to speak about the certificate of death. If we do not act
properly and wisely, there may be an inquest, and that paper would have
to be produced. I am in hopes that we need have no inquest, for if we
had it would surely kill poor Lucy, if nothing else did. I know, and you
know, and the other doctor who attended her knows, that Mrs. Westenra
had disease of the heart, and we can certify that she died of it. Let us
fill up the certificate at once, and I shall take it myself to the
registrar and go on to the undertaker.”
“Good, oh my friend John! Well thought of! Truly Miss Lucy, if she be
sad in the foes that beset her, is at least happy in the friends that
love her. One, two, three, all open their veins for her, besides one old
man. Ah yes, I know, friend John; I am not blind! I love you all the
more for it! Now go.”
In the hall I met Quincey Morris, with a telegram for Arthur telling him
that Mrs. Westenra was dead; that Lucy also had been ill, but was now
going on better; and that Van Helsing and I were with her. I told him
where I was going, and he hurried me out, but as I was going said:—
“When you come back, Jack, may I have two words with you all to
ourselves?” I nodded in reply and went out. I found no difficulty about
the registration, and arranged with the local undertaker to come up in
the evening to measure for the coffin and to make arrangements.
When I got back Quincey was waiting for me. I told him I would see him
as soon as I knew about Lucy, and went up to her room. She was still
sleeping, and the Professor seemingly had not moved from his seat at her
side. From his putting his finger to his lips, I gathered that he
expected her to wake before long and was afraid of forestalling nature.
So I went down to Quincey and took him into the breakfast-room, where
the blinds were not drawn down, and which was a little more cheerful, or
rather less cheerless, than the other rooms. When we were alone, he said
to me:—
“Jack Seward, I don’t want to shove myself in anywhere where I’ve no
right to be; but this is no ordinary case. You know I loved that girl
and wanted to marry her; but, although that’s all past and gone, I can’t
help feeling anxious about her all the same. What is it that’s wrong
with her? The Dutchman—and a fine old fellow he is; I can see
that—said, that time you two came into the room, that you must have
another transfusion of blood, and that both you and he were exhausted.
Now I know well that you medical men speak in camera, and that a man
must not expect to know what they consult about in private. But this is
no common matter, and, whatever it is, I have done my part. Is not that
so?”
“That’s so,” I said, and he went on:—
“I take it that both you and Van Helsing had done already what I did
to-day. Is not that so?”
“That’s so.”
“And I guess Art was in it too. When I saw him four days ago down at his
own place he looked queer. I have not seen anything pulled down so quick
since I was on the Pampas and had a mare that I was fond of go to grass
all in a night. One of those big bats that they call vampires had got at
her in the night, and what with his gorge and the vein left open, there
wasn’t enough blood in her to let her stand up, and I had to put a
bullet through her as she lay. Jack, if you may tell me without
betraying confidence, Arthur was the first, is not that so?” As he spoke
the poor fellow looked terribly anxious. He was in a torture of suspense
regarding the woman he loved, and his utter ignorance of the terrible
mystery which seemed to surround her intensified his pain. His very
heart was bleeding, and it took all the manhood of him—and there was a
royal lot of it, too—to keep him from breaking down. I paused before
answering, for I felt that I must not betray anything which the
Professor wished kept secret; but already he knew so much, and guessed
so much, that there could be no reason for not answering, so I answered
in the same phrase: “That’s so.”
“And how long has this been going on?”
“About ten days.”
“Ten days! Then I guess, Jack Seward, that that poor pretty creature
that we all love has had put into her veins within that time the blood
of four strong men. Man alive, her whole body wouldn’t hold it.” Then,
coming close to me, he spoke in a fierce half-whisper: “What took it
out?”
I shook my head. “That,” I said, “is the crux. Van Helsing is simply
frantic about it, and I am at my wits’ end. I can’t even hazard a guess.
There has been a series of little circumstances which have thrown out
all our calculations as to Lucy being properly watched. But these shall
not occur again. Here we stay until all be well—or ill.” Quincey held
out his hand. “Count me in,” he said. “You and the Dutchman will tell me
what to do, and I’ll do it.”
When she woke late in the afternoon, Lucy’s first movement was to feel
in her breast, and, to my surprise, produced the paper which Van Helsing
had given me to read. The careful Professor had replaced it where it had
come from, lest on waking she should be alarmed. Her eye then lit on Van
Helsing and on me too, and gladdened. Then she looked around the room,
and seeing where she was, shuddered; she gave a loud cry, and put her
poor thin hands before her pale face. We both understood what that
meant—that she had realised to the full her mother’s death; so we tried
what we could to comfort her. Doubtless sympathy eased her somewhat, but
she was very low in thought and spirit, and wept silently and weakly for
a long time. We told her that either or both of us would now remain with
her all the time, and that seemed to comfort her. Towards dusk she fell
into a doze. Here a very odd thing occurred. Whilst still asleep she
took the paper from her breast and tore it in two. Van Helsing stepped
over and took the pieces from her. All the same, however, she went on
with the action of tearing, as though the material were still in her
hands; finally she lifted her hands and opened them as though scattering
the fragments. Van Helsing seemed surprised, and his brows gathered as
if in thought, but he said nothing.

19 September.—All last night she slept fitfully, being always afraid
to sleep, and something weaker when she woke from it. The Professor and
I took it in turns to watch, and we never left her for a moment
unattended. Quincey Morris said nothing about his intention, but I knew
that all night long he patrolled round and round the house.
When the day came, its searching light showed the ravages in poor Lucy’s
strength. She was hardly able to turn her head, and the little
nourishment which she could take seemed to do her no good. At times she
slept, and both Van Helsing and I noticed the difference in her, between
sleeping and waking. Whilst asleep she looked stronger, although more
haggard, and her breathing was softer; her open mouth showed the pale
gums drawn back from the teeth, which thus looked positively longer and
sharper than usual; when she woke the softness of her eyes evidently
changed the expression, for she looked her own self, although a dying
one. In the afternoon she asked for Arthur, and we telegraphed for him.
Quincey went off to meet him at the station.
When he arrived it was nearly six o’clock, and the sun was setting full
and warm, and the red light streamed in through the window and gave more
colour to the pale cheeks. When he saw her, Arthur was simply choking
with emotion, and none of us could speak. In the hours that had passed,
the fits of sleep, or the comatose condition that passed for it, had
grown more frequent, so that the pauses when conversation was possible
were shortened. Arthur’s presence, however, seemed to act as a
stimulant; she rallied a little, and spoke to him more brightly than she
had done since we arrived. He too pulled himself together, and spoke as
cheerily as he could, so that the best was made of everything.
It was now nearly one o’clock, and he and Van Helsing are sitting with
her. I am to relieve them in a quarter of an hour, and I am entering
this on Lucy’s phonograph. Until six o’clock they are to try to rest. I
fear that to-morrow will end our watching, for the shock has been too
great; the poor child cannot rally. God help us all.

“17 September.
“My dearest Lucy,—
“It seems an age since I heard from you, or indeed since I wrote. You
will pardon me, I know, for all my faults when you have read all my
budget of news. Well, I got my husband back all right; when we arrived
at Exeter there was a carriage waiting for us, and in it, though he had
an attack of gout, Mr. Hawkins. He took us to his house, where there
were rooms for us all nice and comfortable, and we dined together. After
dinner Mr. Hawkins said:—
“‘My dears, I want to drink your health and prosperity; and may every
blessing attend you both. I know you both from children, and have, with
love and pride, seen you grow up. Now I want you to make your home here
with me. I have left to me neither chick nor child; all are gone, and in
my will I have left you everything.’ I cried, Lucy dear, as Jonathan and
the old man clasped hands. Our evening was a very, very happy one.
“So here we are, installed in this beautiful old house, and from both my
bedroom and the drawing-room I can see the great elms of the cathedral
close, with their great black stems standing out against the old yellow
stone of the cathedral and I can hear the rooks overhead cawing and
cawing and chattering and gossiping all day, after the manner of
rooks—and humans. I am busy, I need not tell you, arranging things and
housekeeping. Jonathan and Mr. Hawkins are busy all day; for, now that
Jonathan is a partner, Mr. Hawkins wants to tell him all about the
clients.
“How is your dear mother getting on? I wish I could run up to town for a
day or two to see you, dear, but I dare not go yet, with so much on my
shoulders; and Jonathan wants looking after still. He is beginning to
put some flesh on his bones again, but he was terribly weakened by the
long illness; even now he sometimes starts out of his sleep in a sudden
way and awakes all trembling until I can coax him back to his usual
placidity. However, thank God, these occasions grow less frequent as the
days go on, and they will in time pass away altogether, I trust. And now
I have told you my news, let me ask yours. When are you to be married,
and where, and who is to perform the ceremony, and what are you to wear,
and is it to be a public or a private wedding? Tell me all about it,
dear; tell me all about everything, for there is nothing which interests
you which will not be dear to me. Jonathan asks me to send his
‘respectful duty,’ but I do not think that is good enough from the
junior partner of the important firm Hawkins & Harker; and so, as you
love me, and he loves me, and I love you with all the moods and tenses
of the verb, I send you simply his ‘love’ instead. Good-bye, my dearest
Lucy, and all blessings on you.
“Yours,
“Mina Harker.”

Report from Patrick Hennessey, M. D., M. R. C. S. L. K. Q. C. P. I.,
etc., etc., to John Seward, M. D.
“20 September.
“My dear Sir,—
“In accordance with your wishes, I enclose report of the conditions of
everything left in my charge.... With regard to patient, Renfield, there
is more to say. He has had another outbreak, which might have had a
dreadful ending, but which, as it fortunately happened, was unattended
with any unhappy results. This afternoon a carrier’s cart with two men
made a call at the empty house whose grounds abut on ours—the house to
which, you will remember, the patient twice ran away. The men stopped at
our gate to ask the porter their way, as they were strangers. I was
myself looking out of the study window, having a smoke after dinner, and
saw one of them come up to the house. As he passed the window of
Renfield’s room, the patient began to rate him from within, and called
him all the foul names he could lay his tongue to. The man, who seemed a
decent fellow enough, contented himself by telling him to “shut up for a
foul-mouthed beggar,” whereon our man accused him of robbing him and
wanting to murder him and said that he would hinder him if he were to
swing for it. I opened the window and signed to the man not to notice,
so he contented himself after looking the place over and making up his
mind as to what kind of a place he had got to by saying: ‘Lor’ bless
yer, sir, I wouldn’t mind what was said to me in a bloomin’ madhouse. I
pity ye and the guv’nor for havin’ to live in the house with a wild
beast like that.’ Then he asked his way civilly enough, and I told him
where the gate of the empty house was; he went away, followed by threats
and curses and revilings from our man. I went down to see if I could
make out any cause for his anger, since he is usually such a
well-behaved man, and except his violent fits nothing of the kind had
ever occurred. I found him, to my astonishment, quite composed and most
genial in his manner. I tried to get him to talk of the incident, but he
blandly asked me questions as to what I meant, and led me to believe
that he was completely oblivious of the affair. It was, I am sorry to
say, however, only another instance of his cunning, for within half an
hour I heard of him again. This time he had broken out through the
window of his room, and was running down the avenue. I called to the
attendants to follow me, and ran after him, for I feared he was intent
on some mischief. My fear was justified when I saw the same cart which
had passed before coming down the road, having on it some great wooden
boxes. The men were wiping their foreheads, and were flushed in the
face, as if with violent exercise. Before I could get up to him the
patient rushed at them, and pulling one of them off the cart, began to
knock his head against the ground. If I had not seized him just at the
moment I believe he would have killed the man there and then. The other
fellow jumped down and struck him over the head with the butt-end of his
heavy whip. It was a terrible blow; but he did not seem to mind it, but
seized him also, and struggled with the three of us, pulling us to and
fro as if we were kittens. You know I am no light weight, and the others
were both burly men. At first he was silent in his fighting; but as we
began to master him, and the attendants were putting a strait-waistcoat
on him, he began to shout: ‘I’ll frustrate them! They shan’t rob me!
they shan’t murder me by inches! I’ll fight for my Lord and Master!’ and
all sorts of similar incoherent ravings. It was with very considerable
difficulty that they got him back to the house and put him in the padded
room. One of the attendants, Hardy, had a finger broken. However, I set
it all right; and he is going on well.
“The two carriers were at first loud in their threats of actions for
damages, and promised to rain all the penalties of the law on us. Their
threats were, however, mingled with some sort of indirect apology for
the defeat of the two of them by a feeble madman. They said that if it
had not been for the way their strength had been spent in carrying and
raising the heavy boxes to the cart they would have made short work of
him. They gave as another reason for their defeat the extraordinary
state of drouth to which they had been reduced by the dusty nature of
their occupation and the reprehensible distance from the scene of their
labours of any place of public entertainment. I quite understood their
drift, and after a stiff glass of grog, or rather more of the same, and
with each a sovereign in hand, they made light of the attack, and swore
that they would encounter a worse madman any day for the pleasure of
meeting so ‘bloomin’ good a bloke’ as your correspondent. I took their
names and addresses, in case they might be needed. They are as
follows:—Jack Smollet, of Dudding’s Rents, King George’s Road, Great
Walworth, and Thomas Snelling, Peter Farley’s Row, Guide Court, Bethnal
Green. They are both in the employment of Harris & Sons, Moving and
Shipment Company, Orange Master’s Yard, Soho.
“I shall report to you any matter of interest occurring here, and shall
wire you at once if there is anything of importance.
“Believe me, dear Sir,
“Yours faithfully,
“Patrick Hennessey.”
Letter, Mina Harker to Lucy Westenra.
(Unopened by her.)
“18 September.
“My dearest Lucy,—
“Such a sad blow has befallen us. Mr. Hawkins has died very suddenly.
Some may not think it so sad for us, but we had both come to so love him
that it really seems as though we had lost a father. I never knew either
father or mother, so that the dear old man’s death is a real blow to me.
Jonathan is greatly distressed. It is not only that he feels sorrow,
deep sorrow, for the dear, good man who has befriended him all his life,
and now at the end has treated him like his own son and left him a
fortune which to people of our modest bringing up is wealth beyond the
dream of avarice, but Jonathan feels it on another account. He says the
amount of responsibility which it puts upon him makes him nervous. He
begins to doubt himself. I try to cheer him up, and my belief in him
helps him to have a belief in himself. But it is here that the grave
shock that he experienced tells upon him the most. Oh, it is too hard
that a sweet, simple, noble, strong nature such as his—a nature which
enabled him by our dear, good friend’s aid to rise from clerk to master
in a few years—should be so injured that the very essence of its
strength is gone. Forgive me, dear, if I worry you with my troubles in
the midst of your own happiness; but, Lucy dear, I must tell some one,
for the strain of keeping up a brave and cheerful appearance to Jonathan
tries me, and I have no one here that I can confide in. I dread coming
up to London, as we must do the day after to-morrow; for poor Mr.
Hawkins left in his will that he was to be buried in the grave with his
father. As there are no relations at all, Jonathan will have to be chief
mourner. I shall try to run over to see you, dearest, if only for a few
minutes. Forgive me for troubling you. With all blessings,
“Your loving
“Mina Harker.”

Dr. Seward’s Diary.
20 September.—Only resolution and habit can let me make an entry
to-night. I am too miserable, too low-spirited, too sick of the world
and all in it, including life itself, that I would not care if I heard
this moment the flapping of the wings of the angel of death. And he has
been flapping those grim wings to some purpose of late—Lucy’s mother
and Arthur’s father, and now.... Let me get on with my work.
I duly relieved Van Helsing in his watch over Lucy. We wanted Arthur to
go to rest also, but he refused at first. It was only when I told him
that we should want him to help us during the day, and that we must not
all break down for want of rest, lest Lucy should suffer, that he agreed
to go. Van Helsing was very kind to him. “Come, my child,” he said;
“come with me. You are sick and weak, and have had much sorrow and much
mental pain, as well as that tax on your strength that we know of. You
must not be alone; for to be alone is to be full of fears and alarms.
Come to the drawing-room, where there is a big fire, and there are two
sofas. You shall lie on one, and I on the other, and our sympathy will
be comfort to each other, even though we do not speak, and even if we
sleep.” Arthur went off with him, casting back a longing look on Lucy’s
face, which lay in her pillow, almost whiter than the lawn. She lay
quite still, and I looked round the room to see that all was as it
should be. I could see that the Professor had carried out in this room,
as in the other, his purpose of using the garlic; the whole of the
window-sashes reeked with it, and round Lucy’s neck, over the silk
handkerchief which Van Helsing made her keep on, was a rough chaplet of
the same odorous flowers. Lucy was breathing somewhat stertorously, and
her face was at its worst, for the open mouth showed the pale gums. Her
teeth, in the dim, uncertain light, seemed longer and sharper than they
had been in the morning. In particular, by some trick of the light, the
canine teeth looked longer and sharper than the rest. I sat down by her,
and presently she moved uneasily. At the same moment there came a sort
of dull flapping or buffeting at the window. I went over to it softly,
and peeped out by the corner of the blind. There was a full moonlight,
and I could see that the noise was made by a great bat, which wheeled
round—doubtless attracted by the light, although so dim—and every now
and again struck the window with its wings. When I came back to my seat,
I found that Lucy had moved slightly, and had torn away the garlic
flowers from her throat. I replaced them as well as I could, and sat
watching her.
Presently she woke, and I gave her food, as Van Helsing had prescribed.
She took but a little, and that languidly. There did not seem to be with
her now the unconscious struggle for life and strength that had hitherto
so marked her illness. It struck me as curious that the moment she
became conscious she pressed the garlic flowers close to her. It was
certainly odd that whenever she got into that lethargic state, with the
stertorous breathing, she put the flowers from her; but that when she
waked she clutched them close. There was no possibility of making any
mistake about this, for in the long hours that followed, she had many
spells of sleeping and waking and repeated both actions many times.
At six o’clock Van Helsing came to relieve me. Arthur had then fallen
into a doze, and he mercifully let him sleep on. When he saw Lucy’s face
I could hear the sissing indraw of his breath, and he said to me in a
sharp whisper: “Draw up the blind; I want light!” Then he bent down,
and, with his face almost touching Lucy’s, examined her carefully. He
removed the flowers and lifted the silk handkerchief from her throat. As
he did so he started back, and I could hear his ejaculation, “Mein
Gott!” as it was smothered in his throat. I bent over and looked, too,
and as I noticed some queer chill came over me.
The wounds on the throat had absolutely disappeared.
For fully five minutes Van Helsing stood looking at her, with his face
at its sternest. Then he turned to me and said calmly:—
“She is dying. It will not be long now. It will be much difference, mark
me, whether she dies conscious or in her sleep. Wake that poor boy, and
let him come and see the last; he trusts us, and we have promised him.”
I went to the dining-room and waked him. He was dazed for a moment, but
when he saw the sunlight streaming in through the edges of the shutters
he thought he was late, and expressed his fear. I assured him that Lucy
was still asleep, but told him as gently as I could that both Van
Helsing and I feared that the end was near. He covered his face with his
hands, and slid down on his knees by the sofa, where he remained,
perhaps a minute, with his head buried, praying, whilst his shoulders
shook with grief. I took him by the hand and raised him up. “Come,” I
said, “my dear old fellow, summon all your fortitude: it will be best
and easiest for her.”
When we came into Lucy’s room I could see that Van Helsing had, with
his usual forethought, been putting matters straight and making
everything look as pleasing as possible. He had even brushed Lucy’s
hair, so that it lay on the pillow in its usual sunny ripples. When we
came into the room she opened her eyes, and seeing him, whispered
softly:—
“Arthur! Oh, my love, I am so glad you have come!” He was stooping to
kiss her, when Van Helsing motioned him back. “No,” he whispered, “not
yet! Hold her hand; it will comfort her more.”
So Arthur took her hand and knelt beside her, and she looked her best,
with all the soft lines matching the angelic beauty of her eyes. Then
gradually her eyes closed, and she sank to sleep. For a little bit her
breast heaved softly, and her breath came and went like a tired child’s.
And then insensibly there came the strange change which I had noticed in
the night. Her breathing grew stertorous, the mouth opened, and the pale
gums, drawn back, made the teeth look longer and sharper than ever. In a
sort of sleep-waking, vague, unconscious way she opened her eyes, which
were now dull and hard at once, and said in a soft, voluptuous voice,
such as I had never heard from her lips:—
“Arthur! Oh, my love, I am so glad you have come! Kiss me!” Arthur bent
eagerly over to kiss her; but at that instant Van Helsing, who, like me,
had been startled by her voice, swooped upon him, and catching him by
the neck with both hands, dragged him back with a fury of strength which
I never thought he could have possessed, and actually hurled him almost
across the room.
“Not for your life!” he said; “not for your living soul and hers!” And
he stood between them like a lion at bay.
Arthur was so taken aback that he did not for a moment know what to do
or say; and before any impulse of violence could seize him he realised
the place and the occasion, and stood silent, waiting.
I kept my eyes fixed on Lucy, as did Van Helsing, and we saw a spasm as
of rage flit like a shadow over her face; the sharp teeth champed
together. Then her eyes closed, and she breathed heavily.
Very shortly after she opened her eyes in all their softness, and
putting out her poor, pale, thin hand, took Van Helsing’s great brown
one; drawing it to her, she kissed it. “My true friend,” she said, in a
faint voice, but with untellable pathos, “My true friend, and his! Oh,
guard him, and give me peace!”
“I swear it!” he said solemnly, kneeling beside her and holding up his
hand, as one who registers an oath. Then he turned to Arthur, and said
to him: “Come, my child, take her hand in yours, and kiss her on the
forehead, and only once.”
Their eyes met instead of their lips; and so they parted.
Lucy’s eyes closed; and Van Helsing, who had been watching closely, took
Arthur’s arm, and drew him away.
And then Lucy’s breathing became stertorous again, and all at once it
ceased.
“It is all over,” said Van Helsing. “She is dead!”
I took Arthur by the arm, and led him away to the drawing-room, where he
sat down, and covered his face with his hands, sobbing in a way that
nearly broke me down to see.
I went back to the room, and found Van Helsing looking at poor Lucy, and
his face was sterner than ever. Some change had come over her body.
Death had given back part of her beauty, for her brow and cheeks had
recovered some of their flowing lines; even the lips had lost their
deadly pallor. It was as if the blood, no longer needed for the working
of the heart, had gone to make the harshness of death as little rude as
might be.
I stood beside Van Helsing, and said:—
“Ah, well, poor girl, there is peace for her at last. It is the end!”
He turned to me, and said with grave solemnity:—
“Not so; alas! not so. It is only the beginning!”
When I asked him what he meant, he only shook his head and answered:—
“We can do nothing as yet. Wait and see.”
THE funeral was arranged for the next succeeding day, so that Lucy and
her mother might be buried together. I attended to all the ghastly
formalities, and the urbane undertaker proved that his staff were
afflicted—or blessed—with something of his own obsequious suavity.
Even the woman who performed the last offices for the dead remarked to
me, in a confidential, brother-professional way, when she had come out
from the death-chamber:—
“She makes a very beautiful corpse, sir. It’s quite a privilege to
attend on her. It’s not too much to say that she will do credit to our
establishment!”
I noticed that Van Helsing never kept far away. This was possible from
the disordered state of things in the household. There were no relatives
at hand; and as Arthur had to be back the next day to attend at his
father’s funeral, we were unable to notify any one who should have been
bidden. Under the circumstances, Van Helsing and I took it upon
ourselves to examine papers, etc. He insisted upon looking over Lucy’s
papers himself. I asked him why, for I feared that he, being a
foreigner, might not be quite aware of English legal requirements, and
so might in ignorance make some unnecessary trouble. He answered me:—
“I know; I know. You forget that I am a lawyer as well as a doctor. But
this is not altogether for the law. You knew that, when you avoided the
coroner. I have more than him to avoid. There may be papers more—such
as this.”
As he spoke he took from his pocket-book the memorandum which had been
in Lucy’s breast, and which she had torn in her sleep.
“When you find anything of the solicitor who is for the late Mrs.
Westenra, seal all her papers, and write him to-night. For me, I watch
here in the room and in Miss Lucy’s old room all night, and I myself
search for what may be. It is not well that her very thoughts go into
the hands of strangers.”
I went on with my part of the work, and in another half hour had found
the name and address of Mrs. Westenra’s solicitor and had written to
him. All the poor lady’s papers were in order; explicit directions
regarding the place of burial were given. I had hardly sealed the
letter, when, to my surprise, Van Helsing walked into the room,
saying:—
“Can I help you, friend John? I am free, and if I may, my service is to
you.”
“Have you got what you looked for?” I asked, to which he replied:—
“I did not look for any specific thing. I only hoped to find, and find I
have, all that there was—only some letters and a few memoranda, and a
diary new begun. But I have them here, and we shall for the present say
nothing of them. I shall see that poor lad to-morrow evening, and, with
his sanction, I shall use some.”
When we had finished the work in hand, he said to me:—
“And now, friend John, I think we may to bed. We want sleep, both you
and I, and rest to recuperate. To-morrow we shall have much to do, but
for the to-night there is no need of us. Alas!”
Before turning in we went to look at poor Lucy. The undertaker had
certainly done his work well, for the room was turned into a small
chapelle ardente. There was a wilderness of beautiful white flowers,
and death was made as little repulsive as might be. The end of the
winding-sheet was laid over the face; when the Professor bent over and
turned it gently back, we both started at the beauty before us, the tall
wax candles showing a sufficient light to note it well. All Lucy’s
loveliness had come back to her in death, and the hours that had passed,
instead of leaving traces of “decay’s effacing fingers,” had but
restored the beauty of life, till positively I could not believe my eyes
that I was looking at a corpse.
The Professor looked sternly grave. He had not loved her as I had, and
there was no need for tears in his eyes. He said to me: “Remain till I
return,” and left the room. He came back with a handful of wild garlic
from the box waiting in the hall, but which had not been opened, and
placed the flowers amongst the others on and around the bed. Then he
took from his neck, inside his collar, a little gold crucifix, and
placed it over the mouth. He restored the sheet to its place, and we
came away.
I was undressing in my own room, when, with a premonitory tap at the
door, he entered, and at once began to speak:—
“To-morrow I want you to bring me, before night, a set of post-mortem
knives.”
“Must we make an autopsy?” I asked.
“Yes and no. I want to operate, but not as you think. Let me tell you
now, but not a word to another. I want to cut off her head and take out
her heart. Ah! you a surgeon, and so shocked! You, whom I have seen with
no tremble of hand or heart, do operations of life and death that make
the rest shudder. Oh, but I must not forget, my dear friend John, that
you loved her; and I have not forgotten it, for it is I that shall
operate, and you must only help. I would like to do it to-night, but for
Arthur I must not; he will be free after his father’s funeral to-morrow,
and he will want to see her—to see it. Then, when she is coffined
ready for the next day, you and I shall come when all sleep. We shall
unscrew the coffin-lid, and shall do our operation: and then replace
all, so that none know, save we alone.”
“But why do it at all? The girl is dead. Why mutilate her poor body
without need? And if there is no necessity for a post-mortem and nothing
to gain by it—no good to her, to us, to science, to human
knowledge—why do it? Without such it is monstrous.”
For answer he put his hand on my shoulder, and said, with infinite
tenderness:—
“Friend John, I pity your poor bleeding heart; and I love you the more
because it does so bleed. If I could, I would take on myself the burden
that you do bear. But there are things that you know not, but that you
shall know, and bless me for knowing, though they are not pleasant
things. John, my child, you have been my friend now many years, and yet
did you ever know me to do any without good cause? I may err—I am but
man; but I believe in all I do. Was it not for these causes that you
send for me when the great trouble came? Yes! Were you not amazed, nay
horrified, when I would not let Arthur kiss his love—though she was
dying—and snatched him away by all my strength? Yes! And yet you saw
how she thanked me, with her so beautiful dying eyes, her voice, too, so
weak, and she kiss my rough old hand and bless me? Yes! And did you not
hear me swear promise to her, that so she closed her eyes grateful? Yes!
“Well, I have good reason now for all I want to do. You have for many
years trust me; you have believe me weeks past, when there be things so
strange that you might have well doubt. Believe me yet a little, friend
John. If you trust me not, then I must tell what I think; and that is
not perhaps well. And if I work—as work I shall, no matter trust or no
trust—without my friend trust in me, I work with heavy heart and feel,
oh! so lonely when I want all help and courage that may be!” He paused a
moment and went on solemnly: “Friend John, there are strange and
terrible days before us. Let us not be two, but one, that so we work to
a good end. Will you not have faith in me?”
I took his hand, and promised him. I held my door open as he went away,
and watched him go into his room and close the door. As I stood without
moving, I saw one of the maids pass silently along the passage—she had
her back towards me, so did not see me—and go into the room where Lucy
lay. The sight touched me. Devotion is so rare, and we are so grateful
to those who show it unasked to those we love. Here was a poor girl
putting aside the terrors which she naturally had of death to go watch
alone by the bier of the mistress whom she loved, so that the poor clay
might not be lonely till laid to eternal rest....

I must have slept long and soundly, for it was broad daylight when Van
Helsing waked me by coming into my room. He came over to my bedside and
said:—
“You need not trouble about the knives; we shall not do it.”
“Why not?” I asked. For his solemnity of the night before had greatly
impressed me.
“Because,” he said sternly, “it is too late—or too early. See!” Here he
held up the little golden crucifix. “This was stolen in the night.”
“How, stolen,” I asked in wonder, “since you have it now?”
“Because I get it back from the worthless wretch who stole it, from the
woman who robbed the dead and the living. Her punishment will surely
come, but not through me; she knew not altogether what she did and thus
unknowing, she only stole. Now we must wait.”
He went away on the word, leaving me with a new mystery to think of, a
new puzzle to grapple with.
The forenoon was a dreary time, but at noon the solicitor came: Mr.
Marquand, of Wholeman, Sons, Marquand & Lidderdale. He was very genial
and very appreciative of what we had done, and took off our hands all
cares as to details. During lunch he told us that Mrs. Westenra had for
some time expected sudden death from her heart, and had put her affairs
in absolute order; he informed us that, with the exception of a certain
entailed property of Lucy’s father’s which now, in default of direct
issue, went back to a distant branch of the family, the whole estate,
real and personal, was left absolutely to Arthur Holmwood. When he had
told us so much he went on:—
“Frankly we did our best to prevent such a testamentary disposition, and
pointed out certain contingencies that might leave her daughter either
penniless or not so free as she should be to act regarding a matrimonial
alliance. Indeed, we pressed the matter so far that we almost came into
collision, for she asked us if we were or were not prepared to carry out
her wishes. Of course, we had then no alternative but to accept. We were
right in principle, and ninety-nine times out of a hundred we should
have proved, by the logic of events, the accuracy of our judgment.
Frankly, however, I must admit that in this case any other form of
disposition would have rendered impossible the carrying out of her
wishes. For

Frank Wedekind’s name is widely, if vaguely,
known by now, outside of Germany, and at least five
of his plays have been available in English form for
quite some years, yet a résumé of biographical facts
and critical opinions seems necessary as introduction
to this—I will not say authoritative, but more careful—book.
The task is genial, since Wedekind was
my special study at Munich in 1913, and I translated
his two Lulu tragedies the year after. The timidity
or disapprobation betrayed in this respect by our
professional critics of foreign drama makes my duty
the more imperative. James Huneker merely called
him “a naughty boy!” Percival Pollard tiptoed
around him, pointing out a trait here and a trait
there, like a menagerie-keeper with a prize tiger.
Viereck once waxed rapturous over Reinhardt’s production
of Spring’s Awakening (that gave me my
own first inkling of what Wedekind might mean for
me), but my friend Moderwell tossed him off in less
than a page of The Theatre of Today as an immoral
joker out of Simplicissimus. It is true that Wedekind
is by no means easy to grasp or tabulate, true
that greater men, such as Strindberg, have suffered
from similar slighting and ill-considered estimates
here, before they were suitably interpreted; but
[viii]
Wedekind has been dead five years, and the time for
a fair and thoughtful, if very inexhaustive, judgment
of him has surely come.
Although he was of the same generation as the
naturalistic dramatists who everywhere came to the
fore in the 1890’s—Hauptmann, Chekov, Brieux, etc.—Frank
Wedekind was not of them, but far ahead
of them. They are now all but out-moded; his
influence has barely begun. He did not fit his time:
the first twenty years of his active life, in fact, were
spent in continuous friction with the contemporary
world. He experienced the rancor and contempt, the
smart of injustice and the hopeless hatred, of most
outcasts from society. Hostility toward bourgeois
civilization is the keynote of many of his works. He
is—against, I think, his natural tendency—a pessimist—all
the blacker for the flame of strange,
Utopian ideals still flaring up in his most savage
scenes. The wrestle of contradictory wills within him
is what gives his writing its abnormal tensity, what
drives him often to overstrain each dramatic idea till
its analogy to life is so distorted most people find it
morbid. He yearns to annihilate the crude, the
coarse, the ugly and the weak. He has declared,
“The reunion of holiness and beauty as the divine
object of pious devotion is the purpose to which
I offer my life: toward which, indeed, I have striven
since earliest childhood.” Physical beauty, he means:
a sort of Pagan worship of the body—its lowest impulses
and its highest development.... But in
every direction he found that reunion obstructed by
[ix]
his all-too-well regulated German civilization. Like
his own Marquis of Keith he feverishly pursued the
joy of life and could never enjoy his life: when about
to strike a splendid blow for his Promised Land he
would see a spike-helmeted angel with a police-club
sentinel at Eden’s gate. Only in the present century—only,
indeed, after the Great War had determined,
for the Continent, what the outstanding characteristics
of the twentieth century were to be—did
Wedekind, the Expressionist, who despised literature
and thrust raw life upon the stage, arrive at his
present commanding position and win the admiration
and discipleship of many of his countrymen.
Though he died in March, 1918, he had incorporated
in many a play before then both the sensational
content and the free, direct, spasmodic form
which German literature, especially German drama,
was to show in the post-War turmoil and distress.
Georg Kaiser and the other Expressionists so prized
to-day can make no secret of their debt to him, and
the wild rush they represent and play to—to contemplate
man’s lowest impulses, the roots of will and
feeling, the instincts, not the ideals that actuate confused
and drifting peoples, and having studied them
in crude, disordered life to set them down in baldest,
swiftest speech, in rank but penetrating truth—this
rush that is observed in all the Continental countries
but most among the Germans did there alone possess
a guide and prophet in the dead author, analyzer,
wry and bitter thinker, Wedekind.
Less than a twelvemonth after his decease, a desperate,
[x]
revolutionary era found suddenly in this
perverse and pessimistic man, in his harsh world of
whores and swindlers, ruthless materialists and
broken poets, its own true shape and pressure. At
the same time the former standards of good taste,
and theatre-censorships, were swept away; the ban
which had lain heavily on Wedekind throughout his
stormy life, the legal ban and the far more significant
disfavor of the “good citizens,” arbiters of general
opinion, whom he had outraged so in their smug
goodness, their virtuous ideals, their bourgeois self-esteem,—these
now were lifted from his works:
Pandora’s Box became—imagine it—a popular
attraction; from him who had so foreseen the breakdown
of conventional formulæ and unreal modes of
thought all men now feverishly sought some intimation
of what society, dazzled with commotion, must
yet look forward to.
For us in America, confirmed, not shattered, in our
previous illusions and conceit by the war’s outcome,
there is less reason to embrace this scornful soothsayer,
this emissary (one is tempted to believe) from
Mephistopheles himself,—now cold and condescending,
and again intent with hectic hate. For all the
foolish outcry over the freer manners, perhaps the
looser morals, of our youth, we are still certain in
America of our subjective health, of some objective
verities at least, of “progress,” of “ideals,” of many
metaphysical abstractions which Wedekind distrusts,
shows up, derides. Ambassador Gerard, innately,
sensibly, was most American. In his Four Years in
[xi]
Germany he mentions shudderingly our author’s
name, points to the fact that Berlin still was going,
over and over, to performances of Earth-Spirit as
but one more indictment of a degenerate, odious
nation, and plainly shows us what must be the
straight American’s reaction to this volume—if such
“straight,” normal readers should ever take it up.
But none the less it is important for America to question
and to try, to root, if need be, hog-like, to the
bottom of our civilization’s pile, and recognize the
gross and primitive, the basely human, that underlies
each separate soul of us and all our deeds.
Naturalism of one type or another—nineteenth-century
literalness or twentieth-century explosiveness—is
for us the necessary form our Art must take;
for only through the pitiless representing of home
truth can the easy sentimentalism, so hostile to real
literature, be combated, and America given self-knowledge
and real grounds for spiritual leaps in
after-years. O’Neil in drama, Masters in poetry,
Anderson, Lewis, Frank and many more in fiction,
these undeflected observers of our seamier sides, prepare
the way for the full appreciation due to
Wedekind. They are more literary, more artfully
self-conscious than he in his best work. Technique
concerns them more. But it is not merely for the
light his drama throws on dominant European interests
of the moment, it is also for the impulse he may
give to further, similar probing and expression here
at home that these four plays have been prepared—revised
or newly now translated—for eager and
[xii]
earnest readers and (who knows?) it may be, for the
stage.
They are linked together, these four culled from
the score of Wedekind’s writing, not solely in theme
(for though they are recognized in their own land
as the Geschlechtstragödien par excellence, there are
other tragedies of sex from Wedekind’s later years),
but in sequence too, chronological, philosophic.
What an echo, for instance, of the freshness and the
fervor of Spring’s Awakening we hear in the scenes
where Hugenberg, the schoolboy of Earth-Spirit,
Act IV, and Pandora’s Box, Act I, reveals his virginal,
enthusiastic, adventurous, devoted flush of life.
How subtly is Lulu foreshadowed in the vivid sketch
of Ilse in Spring’s Awakening: buoyant, unmoral,—simple
in her acceptance of life complete, more
likable than Lulu in her pity, too, for those not
so full-blooded. How keenly Casti-Piani piques our
interest, in Pandora’s Box, Act II; how satisfyingly
his life is summed and closed in Tod und Teufel—verily
Damnation! The four plays hang together,
and present compactly Wedekind’s own growth of
mind—from ardor, almost missionary zeal, instilling
his own subjective sympathy into his youngsters,
girls as well as boys, of Spring’s Awakening (and his
own hate, as well, of teachers, parents, all their dry
repressive world), to the objective but still passionate
building of full-formed characters, solid plot,
unswerving tragedy (no Muffled Gentleman here!) in
Earth-Spirit, and then to the less contained, extravagant
riot, repulsively cold or hotly ugly,
[xiii]
perverse, verbose, derisive of his audience and even
of his art, that he so rightly named Pandora’s Box;
and lastly to the frank self-revelation, unrealistic
preaching, unmotivated, unartful, yet superbly confident
theatricality of his Damnation!
What a life of disillusionment, self-questioning and
pain must lie behind these changes! Its externals
Wedekind sketched himself, in 1901; but its real
import can only be deduced from close, fond study
of his many plays, his stories and his poems. His
father, a physician, lived—it may be interesting to
us Americans to know—in San Francisco from the
beginning of the gold rush in 1849 till 1864. His
mother was an actress in the German theater there
when the elder Wedekind, at 46, met her and married
her, a girl just half his age. Her father, an
inventor, manufacturer and gifted musician, had died
some years before in a German insane asylum. One
child was born to the couple in America, but they
returned to Germany in 1864 and there, in Hanover,
Frank (note the American, quite un-German form
of the name) was born, on the 24th of July.
In 1872 the family moved to Switzerland, where
Frank grew up, one of six children, amid scenery that
he praises but which, to judge by the absence of any
response to the beauties of nature from most of his
work, had little effect upon him. At 19 he began to
earn his living, at first as a journalist, at 22 as a
press-agent, at 24 as a private secretary, traveling
extensively with his employers (notably the painters
Rudinoff and Willy Grétor) in France and England.
[xiv]
In 1895-96 he was a public reader of Ibsen plays in
Switzerland; in ’96-97, political editor of Simplicissimus
in Munich; in ’97-98, an actor and producer
in a theatrical company which toured North Germany
in Ibsen plays and first presented on the stage
his Earth-Spirit, written in ’93, published in ’95. In
’98-99 he held a similar important post with the resident
company of the Schauspielhaus in Munich and
wrote his great, though local, comedy The Marquis
of Keith.
Save for a term in prison as a result of the
prosecution of the editors of Simplicissimus for
lèse-majesté,—a term enriched by the composition of
his long story of Utopian education—physical
education—for young girls, named Minne-haha
(again the influence of America), which to my ears
is the most pure and limpid piece of German prose
one is ever likely to find,—he continued to reside
in Munich, active in this or that playhouse or cabaret,
for the rest of his life. He composed many
Brettl-lieder, rhymes and music, and sang them in
Bohemian restaurants. Every June, after Max
Reinhardt became a theatrical power in Berlin, he
appeared there as an actor in a series of his own
plays, hastily prepared but persistently repeated
to a slowly growing, grudgingly appreciative public.
As an actor he was a paradox: more natural than
Naturalistic, but more Expressionistic than expressive.
I saw him act several times in his Franziska,
his new play in 1912-13, and marveled at the almost
inarticulate strain, the rigid body, popping eyes,
[xv]
deep-lined and taut-drawn face, that marked him
then. Sartorially he was something of a dude: to
be correct was a requirement he forced upon his
mettlesome temperament. His inheritance, derived
from a mixture of middle-aged, scientific, abstract-minded,
cold North German and young, sensuous,
emotional, artistic Austrian, resulted in a conflict
that could be seen by anyone: he possessed thesis and
antithesis but never synthesis. His face expressed by
turns his fluctuant, opposing sides, Jesuit and ironic
actor, tragedy and vice, now gray, sharp-eyed, superior,—suddenly
warm and deep. He was no artist
on the boards—too stiff, too choked with his own
earnestness, too genuinely intense,—but he was
vastly interesting as a man, a sufferer, a moralist
and preacher inured to being scoffed at and returning
the too normal world hot scorn for scorn.
Extravagances and overemphasis, unmotivated,
violent decisions and spasmodic super-vitality in his
characters, all these his vividest traits, are explicable
on this score of his own clashing disharmony within.
But he himself explains them as an artistic revolt,
merely, against the repressed and colorless dramaturgy
which conquered Germany in the wake of Ibsen.
These bookish plays that stood in the way of his
own starkly abundant theatric art both angered him
to protest and augmented his own trend toward free
unnaturalness. He has in his time, he says (in
Schauspielkunst, a collection of critical notes published
in 1910), played many parts by Sudermann,
Hauptmann, Max Halbe, etc., and he is sure that
[xvi]
actors trained in their literary technique are unequal
to his fierce, full-blooded characters. He
demands acting that shall be like hurdle-racing—bold,
bounding creativeness—but the lesser actors
blue-pencil their hurdles out of the way, while the
greater ones make long “dramatic pauses” before
them and deprive them so of conviction. Certainly,
Wedekind’s jerky stage-style requires a rushing performance
to give even the semblance of smooth
truth to the preposterous, but, when rightly played,
thrilling theatric stories he often tells. Short-of-breath,
dry and uninspired, with voice untrained
for emotional seizures and outbursts, the ordinary
cup-and-saucer actor must of course mar Wedekind’s
plays.
In the field of ethics, however, lay his sharpest
cleavage from his own generation, and his most
dangerous pitfall. The mighty influence of Ibsen
had perverted, when Wedekind began to write, not
merely stagecraft, but all German drama, and turned
it to the contemplation not of life and action, but
of principles: guilt, duty, and atonement. Underrunning
all the enthusiasm for exact representation
and thorough character-delineation that reigned in
1890 was an anæmic current of literary preconceptions,
second-hand ideals, and prime attention to externals,
either mere incidental questions of technique
or moral, philosophic conclusions (most often suicidal)
to problems of responsibility and conduct
prearranged for meek and docile characters. In the
Prologue to Earth-Spirit, Wedekind specifically
[xvii]
mocks the pale and will-less heroes of Hauptmann’s
Lonely Lives and Before Sunrise, and by implication
all the conscientious weakness of the then new
Naturalism. He for his part had a sharp hunger
for life, irrespective of its moral aims and effects,—life
boisterous, physical and energizing. It is reflected
in Melchior in Spring’s Awakening, with
keenest sympathy. He had also a theory, expressed
by Alva, his self-portrait in Pandora’s Box, that the
place to find compelling drama was in the changeful
lives of people who never read a book, who lived by
instinct and expressed themselves, words and deeds,
in total ignorance of cultured ethics. The Paris and
the London scenes of Pandora’s Box may indicate
that in those cities the young dramatist plunged into
this demimonde in person, experienced much, and
actually undermined, instead of strengthening, his
artistic creative power.
In ’90-91, when he wrote Spring’s Awakening, the
26-year-old pioneer playwright was still close to
adolescent tumult, doubt and rapture. He writes
a fluent, subtly interconnected, almost musical suite
of scenes utterly real when dealing with the children
and youthfully satirical when caricaturing the adults.
He has no literary by-end, no preoccupation with
form or naturalism as such, and while he has a moral,
or rather an anti-moral, purpose, and evidently seeks
to include in his play the ontogeny of all the more
common sex-perversions, his chief interest is in Melchior,
Moritz and Wendla—the vividness and promise
of the life awakening in them, the cruelty and tragedy
[xviii]
of its extinguishment, for which the adult world must
take full blame. Whether the play was produced at
all in the 1890’s I do not know. Reinhardt, who
had had marked success with Earth-Spirit among his
very first independent productions, in 1902-03, gave
a very notable interpretation of Spring’s Awakening
in 1906 which attained 390 performances; and it
has been widely acted since then, and in book form
has far outstripped the popularity of any other
Wedekind work. A very imperfect translation appeared
in this country about 1909, and a private
production was later attempted in New York, with
ludicrous inartistry. The “lesson” of the play—“Parents,
respect the possibilities of puberty, and
give it enlightenment and guidance”—is an old story
with us now. We must not forget the date on
Wendla’s tombstone: the play transpires in 1892.
But the multifarious, teeming life, the lovableness
and universal naturalness of the chief characters, and
the free, ardent expression of the young author,—these
are of no specific time, and will keep
Wedekind’s name alive for generations of adolescent
readers.
His foreign experiences seem to have taken place
between the writing of this play and that of
Earth-Spirit. The author is quite out of sight in
Earth-Spirit; he is the animal-tamer of the Prologue,
the showman putting his performers through
their acts. There is a grim objectiveness about
this study of clashing wills and fatal weaknesses.
No moral is in sight, and if the technique is
[xix]
consciously more conventional and studied (note Alva’s
soliloquy in Act III), the matter is far removed
from the Ibsen-Hauptmann fashion of its day. The
dialogue is so idiomatic, so carefully fitted to each
speaker’s character, that this play is by far the
hardest of the four to put in English. Wedekind
has dramatized the attractions and repulsions of
sex among mature people very variously endowed
with strength and courage. He has created Lulu,
the embodiment of primitive, natural, instinctive femininity,
and watched her drive men mad. He offers
no judgments, he indulges in no retrospects or explanations:
this is the fundamental stuff of life as
he has lived it and observed it. It takes a naturally
theatric shape: it is violently dramatic just because
it is real and living.
To these powerful, objective ’90’s of Wedekind
belong also the one-act play Der Kammersänger or
The Tenor, acted in New York in 1916 and published
in Fifty Contemporary One-Act Plays; and
The Marquis of Keith, in which the struggle for success
and money is as turbulently dramatized as the
sex-conflict was in Earth-Spirit. But there is a
moralizing character in The Marquis, a foil for the
conscienceless hero and also a mouthpiece for Wedekind.
As he found himself and his message disregarded,
bitterness overcame him, and more and more
he scolds or preaches directly at his public. He
worked over Pandora’s Box, off and on, throughout
this decade, and the impulse to expound himself ever
and again peeps through its three distorted pictures
[xx]
of low life. Here and there it is deliberately disgusting.
When it was published, in 1901 or ’02, most
of Act II was in bad French, much of Act III in
worse English: author or publisher or both were
self-conscious about it: and promptly it was banned.
There ensued appeals through various courts, and
finally the ban was lifted, an all-German text prepared,
and occasional productions ventured. My
translation, published in New York in 1914, has
never roused objection; why should it?—the bare
speeches without the accompanying action which
I have heard vividly described by friends lately in
Germany, can scarcely be shocking to readers in
1923. Later, Wedekind published the two Lulu
plays together under her name, omitting Earth-Spirit,
Act III (which seems to me indispensable,
none the less), and Pandora’s Box, Act I—a commendable
compression, because the whole cholera
episode is morbid and nearly incredible, and a swift
flight to France after Schön’s murder is quite thinkable
without the long, mostly undramatic speeches
that overload the present commencement of Pandora’s
Box.
The pessimism of the last act is terrific and leads
straight to the mood of Damnation!—a sort of satyr-play,
concluding the three tragedies. In it, quite
unrealistically, is passionately expressed what Pandora’s
Box implies—the hopelessness, the impossibility
of happiness (for one, that is, whose conception
of happiness is physical) from life as at present
organized. This was the mission—this and the
[xxi]
various remedies that Wedekind proposed—which the
world persistently, unshakably condemned. Wedekind
writhed. Between Pandora’s Box and Damnation!
(1905) appeared two scarcely disguised
subjective plays, King Nicolo, or Such is Life, which
is very largely autobiography transferred to fourteenth-century
Italy, a swift, dramatic and pathetic
tale genuinely engaging our sympathies; and Hidalla,
or The Giant Dwarf, which partly by satire, partly
by outright propaganda, sets forth the Wedekindian
point of view—the necessity for a new morality, for
those who are rich enough to afford it: a morality
that puts beauty, not material welfare, first among
its objects, and especially revolutionizes sexual life.
The worthlessness, for Wedekind, of intellectual concepts,
theories, spirituality and all other abstractions—his
utter absorption in the darker, inner world
of feeling, will and instinct, especially the world of
his own jarring soul, unheeding others or society at
large, robs this one-sided drama of true tragic force.
He tried again to justify himself in his next two
plays: Music, a quite objective study of the havoc
artistic education, seduction, abortion, the punishment
of abortion, etc., etc., may cause; and Censorship,
a wholly subjective one-act written after the
lawsuits over Pandora’s Box had been settled, and
striving, not too transparently, to show the world his
truly self-sacrificial and missionary spirit. By this
time disciples were beginning to come to him; he
married; and the force of his irritation spent itself.
His last period begins.
[xxii]
It had little that was new to offer. Schloss Wetterstein
is an engrossing, if extravagant, sex-tragedy
in three semi-independent acts, reminiscent of the
Lulu plays but laid in an aristocratic environment.
The Jack the Ripper of its grewsome end is an
American millionaire—an artist in sadism. Had
Wedekind been reading of Harry Thaw? Franziska
is a parody of Faust, a sort of feminine Faust, a
phantasmagoria in which there every now and then
outcrops a striking, profound, or even beautiful
moment. Franziska finishes not in Faust’s heaven,
but in domesticity, and one cannot clearly discover
whether this is mockery or a real change of view.
Samson, or Shame and Jealousy, and Herakles, are
blank-verse plays of Hebrew or Hellenic legends,
written with lessening power and intensity,—plays
dramatic, poetic, passionate enough to rank with
Hauptmann’s work of the same period but not “so
fair, so wild, so brightly flecked” as Wedekind once
had been. In the first year of the War, finally, appeared
a curiously objective historical character-study
in eight scenes, Bismarck, plainly forerunning
Drinkwater’s Lincoln and its successors, and utterly
un-Wedekindian in style—not a word of sex, of
satire, or of himself. The full tale of his work includes,
besides the above, four very light satiric
farces—one of them, The World of Youth, dated
1889, a most interesting prelude to nearly all his
later ideas; two esoteric verse-dialogues, two pantomime
scenarios constructed in the ’90’s, the time of
his greatest power, and anticipating modern movie
[xxiii]
and ballet technique; a large number of poems,
mostly erotic ballads that he sang to his own accompaniment
(I was reminded of them, and him, when
I first heard Bobby Edwards of Greenwich Village),
and some prose tales, shorter than Minne-haha.
Always he dealt in will, in inner urges, often
specifically in “the hellish drive out of which no joy
remains alive.” His characters, no matter how often
balked, derided, or wounded, return to the attack
Until they are killed. Emotion is an inexhaustible
force. The drama of opposed views, of contrasted
attitudes on points of conduct or belief, can offer
nothing so enthralling as this insatiable struggle for
the most fundamental pleasures humanity knows—which
never ultimately or for long are pleasures!
And the same Satanic return to the attack, repeated
efforts at destruction, are seen in Wedekind’s own
life, hurling play after play against conventional
society. At last, after his death, conventional society
broke down, and the forces of disruption honored
him, and the confused masses sought in his
other, Utopian, constructive work for light upon
the society that is to come. To few writers is such
posthumous homage given; by few can such a reversal
of judgment be expected. Wedekind remained
ever true to himself, his deeply divided, contrary
self, now appearing through his plays, now vanishing
again behind his characters, but always vividly alive:
one could feel him, one had the sense of human passion
and struggle, of something personally experienced
and sweated out, in almost all his work. Hence,
[xxiv]
in the last analysis, his hold upon our later generation:
we too want life, not literature—personality,
not limpid art—original thought, even destructive
and extravagant, not old truths, even the deepest,
newly dressed. Wedekind, like Strindberg, like Andreiev,
and like Shaw, meets these demands. If
America should ever have reason to turn pessimistic,
Wedekind will be waiting; and even as America is, in
Wedekind she can find much that is vital, life-promoting,
of immediate power and worth.

A Children’s Tragedy
Dedicated to
The Muffled Gentleman
[3]
The Scene is laid in Southern Germany or in
Switzerland. The Time is from May
to November, 1892.
[5]
Spring’s Awakening is divided into Nineteen Scenes
as follows:
[6]
It will be noted that the scenes concluding the
acts, long scenes all of them, are intended to occupy
the full stage, and that the prior scenes in each act
may be played in the foreground.
Two of the scenes, II, 3, and III, 6, have nothing
to do with the story and to save time may be omitted,
though the latter has another importance, lightening
with its idyllic atmosphere the squalor and bitterness
of the last act. If it is omitted, III, 4, and III,
5, might be played in reverse order.
The simplest arrangement of the stage would be a
neutral proscenium, six or seven feet deep, pierced
with doors. Behind this, different backwalls can be
lowered, and all the interior scenes played in this
shallow front space. On the back of the stage should
be sloping ground covered with underbrush, and a
path winding down through it. In the middle-stage
can be set the properties for special scenes—a bench
in a box-hedge for I, 2 and 3; a huge oak-trunk for
I, 5; a garden wall with grass and violets for II, 6;
the graveyard wall with Moritz’s grave for III, 2,
etc. The swiftest possible sequence of scenes within
the act is of prime importance.
[7]
Scene I.—A pretty little room, with a window looking
out on an early spring garden. Wendla’s
bed in one corner, wardrobe in the other, table
and two chairs between. Doors just below bed
and wardrobe.
Wendla stands at the foot of the bed, all
dressed except for her frock, which hangs on the
chair in front of her. Her mother stands on the
other side of the table, with a long dress in her
hands.
Wendla—Why did you make the dress so long
for me, mother?
Mrs. Bergmann—You’re fourteen years old to-day!
Wendla—If I had known you were going to make
my dress so long, I’d rather not have been fourteen.
Mrs. Bergmann—It isn’t too long, Wendla.
What do you want? Can I help my girl’s growing
two inches taller every spring? A girl as grown up
as you can’t go round in a little princess-dress!
Wendla—All the same, my little princess-dress
looks better on me than that nightgown. Let me
wear it just once more, mother! Just this summer!
That penitence-frock will suit me just as well at fifteen
as at fourteen: let’s hang it up till my next
birthday! Now I’d only tread on the braid.
[8]
Mrs. Bergmann—I don’t know what I ought to
say. I’d like so much to keep you this way, child,—just
as you are. Other girls are overgrown and
awkward at your age. You’re just the opposite.
Who knows what you will be like when the others are
fully developed?
Wendla—Who knows? Perhaps I shan’t be
at all.
Mrs. Bergmann—Child, child, what makes you
think such things!
Wendla—Don’t, mother dear; oh, don’t be sad.
Mrs. Bergmann—[Kissing her.] My only darling!
Wendla—They come to me so, night-times, when
I can’t go to sleep. They don’t make me a bit sad,
and I know I sleep better afterwards. Is it wrong,
mother, to think about things like that?
Mrs. Bergmann—Go, dear, and hang the “penitence-frock”
away, and put on your princess-dress
again, God bless you! When I get the chance I’ll
put another breadth of ruffles on the bottom of it.
Wendla—[Hanging the dress in the wardrobe.]
No! Then I might as well be all of twenty right
away!
Mrs. Bergmann—If only you don’t get too cold.
In its time that little dress was plenty long enough
for you, but now⁠——
Wendla—Now, with summer coming? Oh,
mother, not even little children get diphtheria in their
knees! Why are you so scary? At my age nobody
freezes, least of all in the legs. Do you think it
[9]
would be better if I got too hot, mother? Thank the
good God if your darling doesn’t cut off her sleeves
some morning and come to you at twilight without
her shoes and stockings!—When I wear my penitence-frock
I’ll dress like a fairy queen under it....
Don’t scold, motherkin,—nobody’ll see how, then!
CURTAIN
[10]
Scene II.—Sunday evening. A gravel walk in front
of a park bench; shrubbery and tree-tops behind.
Melchior enters, followed by the other
boys.
Melchior—I’m tired of that: I don’t want to any
more.
Otto—Then the rest of us can just as well stop,
too. Have you done your work, Melchior?
Melchior—Go on playing, why don’t you!
Moritz—Where are you going?
Melchior—For a walk.
George—It’ll be dark soon.
Robert—Have you done your work already?
Melchior—And why shouldn’t I go for a walk in
the dark?
Ernest—Central America!—Louis XV!—Sixty
lines of Homer!—Seven equations!
Melchior—Damn the work!
George—Oh, if only Latin Comp. didn’t come to-morrow!
Moritz—One can’t think of anything without
some work coming in between!
Otto—I’m going home.
George—I, too, home to work!
Ernest—Me, too; me, too.
Robert—Good night, Melchior.
[11]
Melchior—Sleep well!... [All make off except
Moritz.] Gosh, I’d like to know what we’re in
the world for!
Moritz—School makes me wish I’d been a cabhorse
sooner!—What do we go to school for? So
that somebody can examine us. And what are we
examined for? To make us flunk! Seven of us have
got to flunk just because the classroom upstairs only
holds sixty.—I’ve felt so queer since Christmas!
Devil take me, if it weren’t for Papa I’d tie up my
bundle this very night and be off to Altoona!
Melchior—Let’s talk about something else.
[They go for a walk.]
[In practice, Melchior can here fling himself down on
the bench; Moritz remain standing.]
Moritz—Do you see the black cat there with its
tail stuck up?
Melchior—Do you believe in omens?
Moritz—I don’t quite know.—It came from over
there.—Means nothing!
Melchior—I believe that’s a Charybdis everyone
falls into who has struggled up out of the Scylla of
religious nonsense. Let’s sit down under this beech.
The warm spring wind is streaming over the mountains.
I’d like to be a young Dryad in the woods up
there letting herself be rocked and swung in the highest
tree-tops all night long to-night....
Moritz—Unbutton your vest, Melchior.
Melchior—Ah, how it blows through one’s
clothes!
Moritz—It’s getting so jolly dark you can’t see
[12]
your hand before your face. Where are you? [He
draws Melchior down beside him. Only their voices,
from here on, come out of the darkness.] Don’t you
believe too, Melchior, that modesty in people is just
the effect of their bringing-up?
Melchior—I started thinking about that just the
day before yesterday. No, after all it seems to me
to be deeply rooted in human nature. Imagine undressing
completely before even your best friend!
You wouldn’t do it unless he did it, too, at the same
time. But it’s also more or less a matter of custom.
Moritz—I’ve sometimes thought, if I have children,
boys and girls, right from the start I’ll have
them sleep together in the same room—if possible,
on the same bed—and help each other twice a day
to dress and undress,—and on hot days, boys and
girls alike, let ’em wear nothing at all but a short
tunic, white woolen with just a leather belt. It seems
to me, if they grew up so, they’d surely, later, be
more at ease than we are, usually....
Melchior—Oh, I’m sure of that, Moritz!—The
only question is, what if the girls should have children?
Moritz—How do you mean—have children?
Melchior—I believe there’s a kind of instinct in
that matter. I believe, for instance, if you shut up
a pair of kittens, male and female, and cut them off
from any contact with the outer world—left them
absolutely to their own impulses, that is—well, the
female sooner or later would get pregnant, though
[13]
neither she nor the male had anyone to imitate or
show them how.
Moritz—With animals—yes—it must happen all
by itself.
Melchior—With people, too, just the same! I
ask you, Moritz,—if your boys are sleeping on the
same bed as the girls, and all of a sudden the first
masculine impulses stir in them.... I’d like to bet
with anybody....
Moritz—Yes, you may be right there. But all the
same⁠——
Melchior—And with your girls it would be absolutely
the same at the corresponding age. Not that
a girl exactly—of course, one can’t tell so well ...
at least, it would be natural to expect ... and their
curiosity, too, would be there, to do its share.
Moritz—One question by the way⁠——
Melchior—Well?
Moritz—You’ll answer?
Melchior—Surely.
Moritz—True?
Melchior—There’s my hand. Well, Moritz?
Moritz—Have you written your theme yet?
Melchior—Oh, speak out what you want to say!
No one can hear us or see us.
Moritz—You understand my children would be
made to work all day in the yard or the garden, or
play games that called for real physical exertion.
They’ll have to ride and wrestle and climb, and of
all things not sleep so soft at night as we do. We
[14]
are awfully softened! I don’t believe people dream
when they have hard beds!
Melchior—I’m going to sleep from now till vintage
time in just my hammock. I’ve shoved my bed
behind the stove: they go together. Last winter I
dreamt once that I whipped our Lolo till he couldn’t
move a limb! That was the most horrible thing I’ve
ever dreamt.—What makes you look at me so
strangely?
Moritz—Have you felt them yet?
Melchior—What?
Moritz—How did you phrase it?
Melchior—Masculine impulses?
Moritz—M-hm.
Melchior—Yes indeed!
Moritz—I too.
Melchior—In fact I’ve known that quite a while—nearly
a year.
Moritz—It struck me like a bolt of lightning!
Melchior—You had dreamt?
Moritz—Oh, just a flash ... of legs in sky-blue
tights climbing over the teacher’s desk—to be exact,
I thought they were going to climb over it. I only
got a glimpse of them.
Melchior—George Zirschnitz dreamt of his
mother.
Moritz—Did he tell you that?
Melchior—Out there on the gallows-path.
Moritz—If you only knew what I’ve gone through
since that night!
Melchior—Qualms of conscience?
[15]
Moritz—Qualms of conscience?—Pangs of death!
Melchior—Good God....
Moritz—I thought I was past cure. I thought
I was suffering from some inward weakness.—I only
began to feel easier when I set out to take notes on
the memories of my life. Oh, yes, Melchior! the last
three weeks have been a Gethsemane for me.
Melchior—I had been more or less prepared for
it beforehand. I felt a bit ashamed, but that was all.
Moritz—And yet you’re almost a full year
younger than me.
Melchior—On that point, Moritz, I wouldn’t
waste much thought. By all I can make out, there
is no definite age for this phantom’s first appearance.
You know that big Lämmermeier with the straw-colored
hair and the big nose? He’s three years older
than me, but Hansy Rilow says that to this very day
he dreams of nothing but tarts and apricot jelly.
Moritz—I ask you, how can Hansy Rilow tell
about that?
Melchior—He’s asked him.
Moritz—He’s asked him?—I’d never have dared
to ask anybody!
Melchior—You just asked me, didn’t you?
Moritz—Yes, I did!—Maybe Hansy had made his
will too, beforehand!—Isn’t it a queer game the
world plays with us?! And we’re supposed to be
grateful! I don’t remember having felt the least desire
for this sort of disturbance.—Why couldn’t I
have been left sleeping quietly until everything was
still again! Father and mother could have had a
[16]
hundred better children. But here I am, with no idea
how I got here, and now I must be responsible for
not having stayed away!—Haven’t you sometimes
thought about that too, Melchior: in what kind of
a way exactly we got mixed up in this whirl?
Melchior—Do you mean you don’t know that
either, Moritz?
Moritz—How should I know?—I see how the hens
lay eggs and hear how Mama says she carried me
under her heart; but is that enough?—And I remember
being embarrassed even at five years old when
someone turned up the queen of hearts, she was so
décolleté. That feeling has gone; but to-day I can
scarcely speak to any girl any more without something
abominable coming into my head—and I swear
to you, Melchior, I don’t know what!
Melchior—I’ll tell you the whole thing. I’ve
gotten it partly out of books, partly from pictures,
partly from observations of nature. You’ll be surprised.
It made me an atheist at first. I told George
Zirschnitz about it, too. He wanted to tell Hansy
Rilow, but Hansy had learned it all from his French
governess when he was a kid.
Moritz—I’ve gone through Meyer’s Abridged
from A to Z. Words! just words and more words!
Not one simple explanation! Oh, this reticence!
What good to me is an encyclopædia that has nothing
to say on the most vital question of all?
Melchior—Did you ever see two dogs running
about the streets?
Moritz—No!—Don’t tell me anything yet—not
[17]
to-day, Melchior! I’ve still got Central America
and Louis XV before me, not to speak of the sixty
lines of Homer, the seven equations, the Latin Comp.—I
should lose out at everything to-morrow again.
If I am to drudge successfully I must be as dull as
an ox.
Melchior—But come up to my room with me.
In three-quarters of an hour I’ll have the Homer,
the algebra, and two Latin Comp.’s. I’ll put a few
harmless blunders into yours, and the thing’s done.
Mama’ll make us some lemonade again, and we’ll
talk comfortably about propagation.
Moritz—I can’t!—I can’t talk comfortably about
propagation! If you want to help me, give me your
information in writing. Write down what you know.
Make it as short and plain as you can, and stick it
between my books to-morrow at recess. I’ll carry
it home without knowing I have it, and come upon
it sometime unexpectedly. I won’t be able to help
skimming thru it, even if I’m tired.... If it’s absolutely
necessary, you can draw something in the
margin, too.
Melchior—You’re like a girl.... But just as
you like. It’ll be an interesting job for me all right.—One
question, Moritz.
Moritz—Hm?
Melchior—Have you ever seen a girl?
Moritz—Yes!
Melchior—All?
Moritz—Every bit!
[18]
Melchior—I, too.—Then no illustrations will be
necessary.
Moritz—At the Shooting-meet, in Leilich’s Anatomical
Museum. If it had come up, I’d have been
chucked out of school. As beautiful as the daylight—and
oh, so true!
Melchior—I was with Mama in Frankfort last
summer— Are you going already, Moritz?
Moritz—To get my work done.—Good night.
Melchior—So long!
CURTAIN
[19]
Scene III.—A stormy afternoon. Martha, Wendla
and Thea are coming along the path.
Martha—How the water gets into your shoes!
Wendla—How the wind whistles past your
cheeks!
Thea—How your heart pounds!
Wendla—Let’s go out to the bridge. Ilse said
the river was full of bushes and trees. The boys
have a raft on the water. They say Melchi Gabor
nearly got drowned yesterday evening.
Thea—Oh, he can swim!
Martha—You bet he can, kid!
Wendla—If he hadn’t been able to swim, I guess
he’d have been really drowned.
Thea—Your braid’s coming out, Martha, your
braid’s coming out!
Martha—Pooh, let it! It bothers me so all the
time! I can’t wear my hair short, like you; I can’t
wear it loose like Wendla; I can’t wear a bang; and
at home I even have to put it up—all on account of
my aunt!
Wendla—I’ll bring scissors with me to-morrow
to the confirmation-class. While you’re reciting
“Well for him who erreth not” I’ll cut it off!
Martha—For God’s sake, Wendla! Papa’ll beat
[20]
me to pieces, and Mama’ll lock me up three nights
in the coal-hole!
Wendla—What’ll he beat you with, Martha?
Martha—It often strikes me that they’d miss
something, after all, if they didn’t have such a horrid
little brat as I am.
Thea—Oh, my dear!
Martha—Aren’t you allowed to have a sky-blue
ribbon thru the top of your chemise?
Thea—Pink satin! Mama thinks pink goes well
with my pitch-black eyes.
Martha—Blue’s awfully becoming to me.—Well,
Mama yanked me out of bed by the hair—this way;
I fell with my hands out on the floor.—You see Mama
prays with us night after night....
Wendla—In your place I’d have run away from
them long ago, out into the world.
Martha—There! That’s it, that’s just what I’m
aiming at. That’s just it.—But she’d like to see me!
Oh, she’d just like to see me! At any rate, I shan’t
have anything to blame my mother for later on!
Thea—Huh—huh—
Martha—Can you possibly think, Thea, what
Mama meant by that?
Thea—Not I— Can you, Wendla?
Wendla—I would simply have asked her.
Martha—I lay on the floor and shrieked and
screamed. In comes Papa. Rip!—Off with the
chemise! Out of the door with me! There now!
Maybe I’d like to go down on the street like that,
eh?...
[21]
Wendla—Oh, Martha, that just can’t be true!
Martha—I froze. I told all about it. Well, I
must sleep in the sack the whole night.
Thea—Never in my life could I sleep in a sack!
Wendla—I really wish I could sleep in your sack
for you sometime.
Martha—If only you’re not beaten⁠——
Thea—But don’t you smother in it?
Martha—Your head stays out. It’s tied under
your chin.
Thea—And then do they beat you?
Martha—No. Only when there’s something special.
Wendla—What do they beat you with, Martha?
Martha—Oh, what—with anything handy.—Does
your mother think it’s “disreputable” to eat
a piece of bread in bed?
Wendla—No, no.
Martha—I do believe they enjoy it, though, even
if they never speak of that.—When once I have children
I’ll let them grow up like the weeds in our
flower-garden. No one bothers himself about
them, and they stand so high, so thick!—while the
roses in the beds are flowering worse and worse each
summer.
Thea—When I have children I’ll dress them all
in rosy pink—pink hats, pink dresses, pink shoes.
Only their stockings—their stockings will be black as
night! Then when I go walking I’ll have them march
ahead of me.—And you, Wendla?
[22]
Wendla—How do you two know that you’ll have
any?
Thea—Well, why shouldn’t we have some?
Martha—It’s true Aunt Euphemia hasn’t any.
Thea—Silly! That’s because she’s not married!
Wendla—Aunty Bauer was married three times,
and hasn’t got one.
Martha—If you have any, Wendla, which would
you rather—boys or girls?
Wendla—Boys! Boys!
Thea—Me too—boys!
Martha—Me too—better twenty boys than three
girls.
Thea—Girls are tiresome.
Martha—If I weren’t a girl already, I surely
wouldn’t want to be one any more!
Wendla—That’s a matter of taste, I guess, Martha.
I’m glad every day that I’m a girl. I wouldn’t
exchange with a prince, believe me.—But that’s why
I’d only want boys.
Thea—But that’s nonsense, Wendla, rank nonsense!
Wendla—But look here, child,—mustn’t it be a
thousand times more uplifting to be loved by a man
than by a girl?
Thea—But you wouldn’t say that forest-inspector
Pfälle loved Melitta more than she loves
him!
Wendla—Yes, I would, too, Thea.—Pfälle is
proud. Pfälle is proud of being forest-inspector,
for he has nothing else.—Melitta is happy,
[23]
because she gets ten thousand times more than she is.
Martha—Aren’t you proud of yourself,
Wendla?
Wendla—That would be silly.
Martha—How proud I wish I could be, in your
place!
Thea—Only see how she puts her feet down, how
straight ahead she looks, how she holds herself, Martha!
If that isn’t pride—
Wendla—But what for? I’m so happy that I’m
a girl! If I weren’t one, I’d kill myself, so that next
time.... [Stops, seeing Melchior. He crosses
past them, greeting them, and goes, followed by their
eyes.]
Thea—He’s got a wonderful head.
Martha—That’s how I think of the young Alexander,
when he went to school to Aristotle.
Thea—Oh, good gracious! Greek History!—I
only remember how Socrates lay in his tub when
Alexander sold him the donkey’s shadow.
Wendla—They say he’s the third best in his
class.
Thea—Professor Knochenbruch says he could be
first, if he wanted to.
Martha—He has a lovely forehead, but his friend
has more soulful eyes.
Thea—Moritz Stiefel?—He’s a stupid!
Martha—I’ve always gotten on with him perfectly
well.
Thea—He humiliates you, no matter where you
are with him. At the Rilows’ party he offered me
[24]
some sugar-almonds. Imagine, Wendla,—they were
soft and warm! Isn’t that just—— He said he
had kept them too long in his trousers pocket!
Wendla—Think of this: Melchi Gabor told me
that time that he didn’t believe in anything—not in
God, or in a future life—in just nothing in the
world!
CURTAIN
[25]
Scene IV.—Near the Boys’ School. All the boys
but Melchior and Moritz and Ernest Roebel
are standing about expectantly.
Melchior—[Entering.] Can any of you tell me
where Moritz Stiefel is keeping himself?
George—He’s going to catch it—Oh, he’s going
to catch it!
Otto—He’ll go too far once, and then he’ll get
what’s coming to him good and plenty.
Lämmermeier—Lord knows I wouldn’t like to be
in his shoes at this moment!
Robert—Some cheek! Some impudence!
Melchior—But wha—wha—what do you mean?
George—What do we mean?—Well, listen....
Lämmermeier—I wish I hadn’t said anything.
Otto—Me too—wish I hadn’t!
Melchior—If you don’t tell me this minute⁠——
Robert—Well, here it is: Moritz Stiefel has
broken into the Faculty-Room!
Melchior—The Faculty-Room!
Otto—The Faculty-Room! Right after Latin.
George—He was the last out. He stayed behind
on purpose.
Lämmermeier—As I turned the hall corner I saw
him opening the door.
Melchior—You go to⁠——
[26]
Lämmermeier—Yeah, if only he doesn’t go
to⁠——
George—I guess someone had left the key in the
lock.
Robert—Or else Moritz Stiefel has a pick-lock
on him.
Otto—I’d believe it of him!
Lämmermeier—If he has luck he’ll only get a
Sunday afternoon.
Robert—Along with a demerit in his report.
Otto—If he doesn’t get a suspension on top of
a reprimand.
Hansy Rilow—There he is!
Melchior—Pale as a sheet. [Moritz appears,
in the utmost excitement.]
Lämmermeier—Moritz, Moritz, what have you
done?
Moritz—Nothing—nothing⁠——
Robert—You’re feverish.
Moritz—With joy—with rapture—with jubilation⁠——
Otto—You were caught——?
Moritz—I’ve passed!—Melchior, I’ve passed!
Oh, let the world go hang now—I have passed!—Who
would have believed that I’d be promoted! I
can’t realize it! Twenty times over I read it! I
can’t believe it—but God be thanked, there it was—there
it stayed! I am promoted!—[Smiling.] I
don’t know—I feel so queer—the earth’s going
round.... Melchior, Melchior, if you only knew
what I’ve gone thru!
[27]
Hansy Rilow—Congratulations, Moritz!—Just
be glad that you got away safe!
Moritz—You don’t know, Hansy—you can’t
imagine what depended on it. For the last three
weeks I’ve slunk past that door as though it were
the mouth of hell. Then, to-day,—it was ajar! I
think if a million had been offered me, nothing, oh,
nothing could have held me back! Before I knew
it I was standing in the middle of the room—I was
opening the record book, turning the pages, finding—and
during all that time—it makes me shudder!⁠——
Melchior—During all that time⁠——
Moritz—All that time the door behind me was
standing wide open!—How I got out, how I got down
the stairs, I don’t remember.
Hansy Rilow—Did Ernest Roebel pass, too?
Moritz—Oh, yes, Hansy, sure! Ernest Roebel is
promoted the same way.
Robert—Then you just can’t have read right.
Not counting the dunces’ bench, there are sixty-one
of us with you and Roebel, and the upper classroom
can’t hold more than sixty!
Moritz—I read perfectly right. Ernest Roebel
is moved up just as I am—both of us, for the present,
to be sure, only provisionally. During
the first quarter it will be decided which of us must
make room for the other.—Poor Roebel! God knows
I’m not afraid for myself any more. I’ve looked
too far down into the depths this time for that!
[28]
Otto—I bet you five marks it’ll be you that makes
room.
Moritz—You haven’t got it. I don’t want to
rob you.—Gosh, won’t I grind from now on!—Now
I can tell you all too,—and you can believe it or not,
it doesn’t matter now—but I know, I know how true
it is: if I had not been promoted, I’d have shot myself.
Robert—Brag!
George—The coward!
Otto—I’d like to see you shoot anything!
Lämmermeier—Punch his face!
Melchior—[Punches Lämmermeier.] Come
along, Moritz. Let’s go to the forester’s house.
George—Do you really believe that rot?
Melchior—Is that your business?—Let ’em talk,
Moritz. Just let’s get away, out o’ the city. [He
pulls him away. They meet Professors Knochenbruch
and Hungergurt, touch their caps, and
exeunt. The other boys vanish, to the other side.]
Knochenbruch—It is beyond my comprehension,
dear colleague, how the best of my pupils can feel
drawn like that to the very worst of them all.
Hungergurt—And beyond mine too, dear colleague.
CURTAIN
[29]
Scene V.—A sunny afternoon in a wood of beech
and oak trees. Thick undergrowth. A big oak-trunk
with mossy roots. By it, Wendla
stands, looking about for the path. Melchior
breaks thru the brush.
Melchior—[Seeing her, stops dead.] Is it
really you, Wendla? What are you doing up here
so all alone? I’ve been tramping up and down this
wood for the last three hours without meeting a
soul, and now all of a sudden you step out of the
thickest covert at me!
Wendla—Yes, it’s I.
Melchior—If I didn’t know you were Wendla
Bergmann I’d think you were a Dryad fallen out
of the branches!
Wendla—No, no, I’m Wendla Bergmann.—Where
have you come from?
Melchior—I’m following my thoughts.
Wendla—I’m looking for woodruff.⁠[1] Mama
wants to flavor May-wine with them. At first she
was going to come too, but at the last moment Aunty
Bauer turned up, and she doesn’t like to climb: so
I came up here alone.
Melchior—Have you got your woodruff?
Wendla—The whole basket full. Over there
[30]
under the beech-trees they’re as thick as meadow-clover.
Just now I’m looking round for a way out.
I seem to have got mixed up. Maybe you can tell
me what time it is.
Melchior—Just after ha’ past three.—When do
they expect you back?
Wendla—I thought it would be later. I lay a
long time in the moss by the brook and dreamed.
The time went by me so quickly, I was afraid it
would soon be night.
Melchior—If nobody’s expecting you yet, let’s
lie down here a little while. Under the oak there’s
my favorite place. When you lean your head back
against the trunk and stare thru the twigs at the
sky, you get hypnotized. [He does as he says.]
The ground is still warm from the morning sun.
[She sits on a root.]—There’s something I’ve wanted
to ask you for weeks, Wendla.
Wendla—But I must be at home before five.
Melchior—We’ll go in time together. I’ll take
the basket and we’ll strike out thru the underbrush
and get to the bridge in ten minutes. When one
lies like this, with his forehead in his palm, one gets
the strangest ideas....
Wendla—What was it you wanted to ask me,
Melchior?
Melchior—I’ve heard, Wendla, that you go a
lot to poor people and take them things to eat and
even clothes and money. Do you do that of your
own accord or does your mother send you?
Wendla—Generally Mother sends me. There are
[31]
poor laborers’ families with an awful lot of children.
Often the man is out of work, and then they’re
cold or go hungry. We have still such a lot of
things left in cupboards and bureaus that we don’t
need any longer.—But what made you think of it?
Melchior—Do you like to go, or not, when your
mother sends you on such errands?
Wendla—Oh, I like to ever so much!—How can
you ask?
Melchior—But the children are dirty, the
women are sick, the rooms are alive with filth, the
men hate you because you don’t work⁠——
Wendla—That isn’t true, Melchior,—and if it
were true I’d go all the more!
Melchior—What do you mean, Wendla,—all the
more?
Wendla—I’d go all the more for that: it would
give me so much more pleasure to be able to help
them!
Melchior—Oh, so you go to the poor people for
the pleasure you get out of it!
Wendla—I go because they’re poor!
Melchior—But if it didn’t give you any pleasure,
would you stop going?
Wendla—Well, can I help it if it does give me
pleasure?
Melchior—[Rolling over and staring straight
up.] And yet it’s for that that you’ll get into
heaven!—So it was true, the thought that has left
me no peace for the last month!—Can the skinflint
[32]
help it if it doesn’t give him any pleasure to go
and visit sick and dirty children?
Wendla—Oh, I’m sure it would give you the
greatest pleasure!
Melchior—And yet it’s for that that he’s condemned
to everlasting death. [Sits up, his back
against the tree.] I’ll write it up and send it to
Pastor Kahlbauch. He started me on this. Why
does he drivel to us about “the joy of sacrifice”?—If
he can’t answer me I won’t go to his Sunday-school
any more, nor let myself be confirmed.
Wendla—Why do you want to give pain to your
dear father and mother? Let yourself be confirmed!
It won’t cost you your head! If it weren’t
for our horrid white dresses and your baggy
trousers, perhaps one could even feel enthusiastic
about it.
Melchior—There is no self-sacrifice. There is
no unselfishness.—I see the good rejoice in their
goodness, and the wicked tremble and groan—I see
you, Wendla Bergmann, shake your curls and
laugh, and I get as glum about it as a pariah!—What
did you dream about just now, Wendla, when
you lay in the grass by the brookside?
Wendla—Silly things—foolishness⁠——
Melchior—With your eyes open?
Wendla—Oh, I dreamt I was a poor beggar-child,
oh, awfully poor, who was shoved out on the
street at five in the morning and had to beg the
whole day long in wind and rain among harsh,
[33]
hard-hearted people; and if I came home at night shivering
with hunger and cold, and hadn’t as much money
as my father wanted, then I was beaten and
beaten....
Melchior—Oh, I know, Wendla. You get that
out of silly kid-stories. Believe me, such brutal people
don’t exist any more!
Wendla—Oh, yes, they do, Melchior,—you don’t
know!—Martha Bessel is beaten night after night,
so that you can see the marks the next day. Oh,
what she must suffer! It makes you boiling hot to
hear her tell about it. I’m so terribly sorry for
her, I often have to cry into my pillow in the middle
of the night. For months I’ve been thinking and
thinking how to help her. I’d joyfully put myself
in her place for a week.
Melchior—Her father should simply be reported
to the police. Then they’d take the child away
from him.
Wendla—I, Melchior, have never been whipped
in my life—not one single time. I can scarcely
guess what it’s like to be beaten. I’ve tried hitting
myself, to find out how it feels really, inside.—It
must be a shuddery sensation.
Melchior—I don’t believe a child is ever made
better by it.
Wendla—Better by what?
Melchior—Being struck.
Wendla—[Reaching over and plucking a young
shoot.] With this switch, for example.—Whew, but
that’s strong and slender!
[34]
Melchior—That would draw blood.
Wendla—Wouldn’t you hit me with it once?
Melchior—You?
Wendla—Yes.
Melchior—What’s got into you, Wendla?
Wendla—[Drawing back, a little alarmed.]
Why shouldn’t you?
Melchior—Oh, don’t shrink. I won’t hit you.
Wendla—But even if I let you?
Melchior—Never, girl!
Wendla—Even if I ask you to, Melchior?
Melchior—Have you lost your senses?
Wendla—I have never in my life been beaten!
Melchior—If you can beg for a thing like
that!...
Wendla—[Thrusting it into his hands.] I do!
Please!
Melchior—I’ll teach you to say Please! [Strikes
her.]
Wendla—Oh, what! I don’t feel the least thing!
Melchior—No wonder—thru all your skirts like
that....
Wendla—Then hit me on the legs—here!
Melchior—Wendla! [Strikes her harder.]
Wendla—Oh, you’re just stroking me!—You’re
stroking me!
Melchior—You wait, you witch—I’ll beat the
devil out of you! [He throws the sprig aside and
falls upon her with his fists so that she breaks out
with a fearful cry. Undeterred, raging, his blows
[35]
rain on her thick and fast, while big tears overflow
and streak his cheeks. Of a sudden, he springs upright,
clasps his temples with both hands, and, passionately
sobbing, plunges into the forest.]
CURTAIN
[36]
Scene I.—Melchior’s study. A recess, rear center,
with casements looking out upon moonlit
garden and dark, evening woods. Window-seat.
Low table with a well-shaded oil lamp,
books, cigarettes, etc. Moritz and Melchior
sit on the two ends of the window-seat, in profile,
facing each other.
Moritz—Now I’m quite cheerful again—only a
bit excited. But in the Greek class I went to sleep
like the besotted Polyphemus! I’m amazed old
Zungenschlag didn’t tweak my ears. This morning
again I came within an ace of being late. My first
thought when I woke up was of the verbs in -MI.
Gee whiz, but didn’t I conjugate all during breakfast
and along the road till everything turned green
before me!—It must have been a little after three
when I dropped off. The pen left a blot on my
book. The lamp was smoking when Matilda woke
me. In the elders under my window the blackbirds
were twittering so joyously—I got unutterably
melancholy again at once. I buttoned my collar
and pulled the brush thru my hair.—But you feel it
when you force yourself against nature....
Melchior—Shall I roll you a cigarette?
Moritz—No, thanks—I won’t smoke.—If only it
can keep on like this! I mean to work and work
[37]
till my eyes pop out of my head. Ernest Roebel
has fallen down six times already since vacation—three
times in Greek, twice with Knochenbruch, last
time in History of Literature. I haven’t been in
that pitiful fix more than five times, and from to-day
on it shall never happen again!—Roebel won’t shoot
himself. Roebel hasn’t got parents who are sacrificing
their all for him. Whenever he wants to,
he can be a soldier of fortune or a cowboy or a
sailor. But if I fail my father’ll have a stroke and
Mama’ll go crazy. That’s the kind of thing nobody
would live to see. Before the exam I prayed
God to let me get consumption, so that the cup
might pass me by untasted. It did pass over—even
tho its nimbus still gleams at me from afar so
that I never dare to lift my eyes.—But now that
I’ve got hold of the first rung I shall haul myself
up. I’m sure of that, because the inevitable consequence
of a fall will be a broken neck.
Melchior—There’s an undreamed-of meanness to
this life. It wouldn’t take much to make me hang
myself up in the branches.—Wonder where Mama
can be with the tea.
Moritz—Your tea will do me good, Melchior.—I’m
actually trembling! I feel so strangely sensitized.
Touch me a moment. I see, I hear, I feel much
more sharply, and yet everything’s so dreamy, so
charged with atmosphere.—How the garden recedes
in the moonlight there, so still, so deep, as if it went
on forever! Dim-veiled figures are moving among the
bushes; they slip over the open tracts in breathless
[38]
activity, and vanish in the half-dark. I should say
they were holding a conference under the chestnut-tree.—Shan’t
we go down, Melchior?
Melchior—Let’s wait till we’ve had some tea.
Moritz—The leaves whisper so eagerly. It’s as
if I were hearing dead Grandmother tell the story
of the Queen without a Head. She was a perfectly
beautiful queen, fair as the sun, lovelier than all
the maidens in the land,—only she had come into
the world, alas! without a head. She couldn’t eat
nor drink nor see nor laugh nor kiss either. She
could only make herself understood to her court
thru her supple little hand. With her dainty feet
she tossed off declarations of war and death-sentences.
Then one day she was conquered by a king
who happened to have two heads that were always
at outs with each other—quarreled the whole year
long so hard that neither let the other speak a
word. So the chief court conjurer took the smaller
of the two heads and set it on the queen; and lo and
behold, it was mighty becoming to her; so then the
king married the queen and the two were no longer
at loggerheads but kissed each other on the forehead
and the cheeks and the mouth, and lived for a
long, long time after in happiness and joy....
Confounded rot! Since vacation I haven’t been able
to get the Headless Queen out of my head! If I see
a beautiful girl, I see her without a head,—and then
all of a sudden I appear as the Headless Queen—myself!...
Well, it’s possible that one will be set
on my shoulders yet. [Mrs. Gabor enters with a
[39]
tray of steaming tea, which she sets down on the
table after moving the lamp a little, and then shakes
hands with Moritz.]
Mrs. Gabor—Here, children! Fall to!—Good
evening, Moritz Stiefel. How are you?
Moritz—[Standing.] Well, thank you, Mrs.
Gabor.—I’m listening to the roundelays down there.
Mrs. Gabor—But you’re not looking a bit well.—Don’t
you feel quite right?
Moritz—It’s nothing to speak of. I’ve been
rather late getting to bed the last few nights.
Melchior—Think of it—he’s been studying all
night!
Mrs. Gabor—You shouldn’t do that kind of
thing, Master Stiefel! You should take care of
yourself. Look out for your health. School can’t
take the place of health in your life. Take frequent
long walks in the fresh air! That is worth
more to you at your age than correct Middle High
German!
Moritz—I will go walking oftener. You’re right.
One can work, too, while one is walking. Why didn’t
I think of that myself!—The written lessons I should
have to do at home just the same.
Melchior—You’ll do the written work here with
me. That way it’ll be easier for both of us.—You
know, Mama, Max von Trenk has been down with
brain-fever. Well, this noon Hansy Rilow came
from Trenk’s death-bed to inform Mr. Sonnenstich
that Trenk had just died in his presence. “Is that
so?” says Sonnenstich. “Haven’t you still got two
[40]
hours’ work to make up from last week? Here’s the
note to the proctor. See that the thing is cleared
up at last. The entire class will attend the interment.”—Hansy
was simply paralyzed.
Mrs. Gabor—What is that book you have there,
Melchior?
Melchior—“Faust.”
Mrs. Gabor—Have you read it all yet?
Melchior—Not all thru.
Moritz—We’re just at the Walpurgisnacht.
Mrs. Gabor—I should have waited a year or two
more, if I’d been you, before reading that.
Melchior—I don’t know any book, Mama, that
I’ve found so much that was beautiful in. Why
shouldn’t I have read it?
Mrs. Gabor—Because you can’t understand it.
Melchior—How can you know that, Mama? I
feel plainly enough that I’m not able yet to grasp
it in its full sublimity, but....
Moritz—We always read it together. That
makes understanding it vastly easier.
Mrs. Gabor—You are old enough, Melchior, to be
able to judge what is good for you and what isn’t.
Do whatever you feel you can justify. I shall be
the first to realize, and be glad, if you never give me
any reason to have to withhold anything from you.
I only wanted to remind you that even the best can
do harm if one is still too immature to appraise it
rightly. I shall always rather put my trust in you
than in any possible set of educational rules.—If
[41]
you want anything else, children, come and call me,
Melchior: I shall be in my bedroom. [Exit.]
Moritz—Your Mama meant the story of
Gretchen.
Melchior—Have we lingered even a moment over
that!
Moritz—Faust himself can’t have been more cold-blooded
getting thru it!
Melchior—After all, that villainy isn’t the
climax of the poem. Faust could have promised the
girl marriage, he could have deserted her directly
after, without being one whit less guilty in my eyes.
Gretchen could have died of a broken heart for all
the difference I’d see.—When you behold how intensely
everyone always looks first for that sort
of thing, you might think the whole world revolved
round penis and vulva.⁠[2]
Moritz—To be frank with you, Melchior, I’ve had
exactly that feeling since I read your paper. It
fell out at my feet in the first days of vacation. I
had my Plötz [a French grammar] in my hand.—I
bolted the door and ran through your quivering
lines like a frightened owl flying through a blazing
wood. I think I read most of it with my eyes shut.
At your explanations a stream of vague memories
rang in my ears like a song one used to hum joyously
to one’s self in childhood, and at the brink of
death hears from the mouth of another, and is appalled.—My
sympathy was aroused most by what
[42]
you wrote about the girl’s part, I shall never get
over the impression that made. I’m sure, Melchior,
to have to suffer wrong is sweeter than to do wrong.
Blamelessly to have to undergo so sweet a wrong
seems to me the essence of every earthly bliss.
Melchior—I don’t want my bliss given me as
a charity!
Moritz—But why not?
Melchior—I don’t want anything that I haven’t
had to struggle and win for myself.
Moritz—But then is it still enjoyable, Melchior?—The
girl’s delight, Melchior, is like the blessèd
gods’. The girl represses. Her very nature protects
her. She is kept free from any bitterness or
regret up to the last moment, and so can see, all
at once, heaven itself break over her. She is still
fearful of hell in the very instant of discovering
and embracing paradise. Her senses are as fresh
as the spring that bubbles from pure rock. She lays
hold of a cup no earthly breath has yet clouded—a
draught of nectar that she takes and swallows even
as it flames and flares.... The gratification that
the man receives seems to me shallow and flat beside
hers!
Melchior—Let it seem what it will to you, but
keep it to yourself. I don’t like to think about it.
CURTAIN
[43]
Scene II.—Wendla’s room, empty. Mrs. Bergmann,
her hat on, her shawl round her shoulders,
a basket on her arm, enters with beaming
face.
Mrs. Bergmann—Wendla! Wendla!
Wendla—[Appearing, half dressed, at the other
door.] What is it, Mother?
Mrs. Bergmann—Up already, dear? Well!
That’s nice of you.
Wendla—Have you been out already?
Mrs. Bergmann—Hurry up now and get dressed!
You must go straight down to Ina’s and take this
basket to her.
Wendla—[Finishing dressing during the following.]
Have you been at Ina’s? How is Ina feeling?
Isn’t she ever going to get better?
Mrs. Bergmann—Just think, Wendla: the stork
came to her last night and brought her a new little
boy!
Wendla—A boy?—A boy?—Oh, that’s grand!—So
it was for that she’s been sick so long with
influenza!
Mrs. Bergmann—A splendid boy!
Wendla—I’ve got to see him, Mother!—So now
I’m an aunt for the third time—one niece and two
nephews!
[44]
Mrs. Bergmann—And what fine nephews they
are!—That’s just the way of it when one lives so
close to the church roof.—It’ll be just two [and a
half?] years to-morrow since she went up those steps
in her wedding-dress!
Wendla—Were you with her when he brought
him, mother?
Mrs. Bergmann—He had just that minute flown
away again!—Don’t you want to pin a rose on here?
[At the front of her dress.]
Wendla—Why didn’t you get there a little bit
sooner, Mother?
Mrs. Bergmann—Why, I do believe, almost, that
he brought you something too—a brooch or something
like that.
Wendla—[Losing patience.] Oh, it’s really too
bad!
Mrs. Bergmann—But I tell you that he did bring
you a brooch too!
Wendla—I’ve got brooches enough....
Mrs. Bergmann—Why, then be happy, darling.
What are you troubled about?
Wendla—I’d like to have known, so much,
whether he flew in by the window or down the chimney.
Mrs. Bergmann—You must ask Ina about that.
[Laughing.] You must ask Ina about that, dear
heart! Ina will tell you all about it exactly. Didn’t
Ina spend a whole half-hour talking to him?
Wendla—I’ll ask Ina as soon as I get down there.
Mrs. Bergmann—Be sure you don’t forget, you
[45]
angel child! Really, I’m interested myself in knowing
if he came in by the window or the chimney!
Wendla—Or how about asking the chimney-sweep,
rather?—The chimney-sweep must know
better than anybody whether he flies down the chimney
or not.
Mrs. Bergmann—No, not the chimney-sweep,
dear; not the chimney-sweep! What does the chimney-sweep
know about the stork? He’ll fill you
chuck-full of nonsense he doesn’t believe himself....
Wha-what are you staring down the street so at?
Wendla—A man, mother, three times as big as
an ox!—with feet like steamboats—!
Mrs. Bergmann—[Plunging to the window.]
Impossible! Impossible!
Wendla—[Right after her.] He’s holding a
bedstead under his chin and fiddling “The Watch on
the Rhine” on it—now he’s just turned the corner....
Mrs. Bergmann—Well! You are and always
were a little rogue! To put your simple old mother
into such a fright!—Go get your hat. I wonder
when you’ll ever get any sense! I’ve given up hope!
Wendla—So have I, Mother; so’ve I. It’s
pretty sad about my sense! Here I have a sister
who’s been married two and a half years; here I am
an aunt three times over; and I haven’t the least
idea how it all happens!... Don’t be cross,
motherkin! don’t be cross! Who in the world should
I ask about it but you? Please, Mother dear, tell
it to me! Tell me, darling motherkin! I feel
[46]
ashamed at myself! Please, please, mother, speak!
Don’t scold me for asking such a thing. Tell me
about it—how does it happen—how does it all come
about?—Oh, you can’t seriously expect me still to
believe in the stork when I’m fourteen!
Mrs. Bergmann—But, good Lord, child, how
queer you are! What things do occur to you!
Really, I just can’t do that!
Wendla—But why not, mother? Why not? It
can’t be anything ugly, surely, when everyone feels
so glad about it!
Mrs. Bergmann—Oh, oh, God defend me!—Have
I deserved to—— Go and put your things on, girl,—put
your things on.
Wendla—I’m going ... and supposing your
child goes out now and asks the chimney-sweep?
Mrs. Bergmann—Oh, but that’s enough to drive
me crazy!—Come, child, come here: I’ll tell you....
Oh, Almighty Goodness!—only not to-day, Wendla!
To-morrow, day after, next week, whenever you
want, dear heart!
Wendla—Tell it to me to-day, mother. Tell
it to me now; now, at once. Now that I’ve seen you
so upset, it’s all the more impossible for me to quiet
down again until you do!
Mrs. Bergmann—I just can’t, Wendla.
Wendla—Oh, but why can’t you, motherkin?—Here
I’ll kneel at your feet and put my head in your
lap. Cover my head with your apron and talk and
talk as if you were sitting all soul alone in the room.
I won’t move a muscle, I won’t make a sound; I’ll
[47]
keep perfectly still and listen, no matter what may
come!
Mrs. Bergmann—Heaven knows, Wendla, it isn’t
my fault! The good God knows me.—Come, in His
name!—I will tell you, little girl, how you came into
this world—so listen, Wendla....
Wendla—[Under her apron.] I’m listening.
Mrs. Bergmann—[Incoherent.] But it’s no use,
child! That’s all! I can’t justify it.—I know I
deserve to be put in prison,—to have you taken
from me....
Wendla—[Under her apron.] Pluck up heart,
Mother!
Mrs. Bergmann—Well, then, listen....
Wendla—[Trembling.] O God, O God!
Mrs. Bergmann—To have a child—you understand
me, Wendla?⁠——
Wendla—Quick, mother! I can’t bear it much
longer!
Mrs. Bergmann—To have a child—one must
love the man—to whom one is married—love him,
I say,—as one can only love a man! You must love
him so utterly—with all your heart—that—that—it
can’t be told! You must love him, Wendla, as you
at your age can’t possibly love anyone yet....
Now you know.
Wendla—[Getting up.] Great—God—in
Heaven!
Mrs. Bergmann—Now you know what tests lie
before you!
Wendla—And that is all?
[48]
Mrs. Bergmann—God help me, yes, all!—Now
pick up the basket there and go down to Ina.
You’ll get some chocolate there, and cakes with it.—Come
here—let me just look you over—laced
boots, silk gloves, sailor-blouse, a rose in your hair....
But your little dress is really getting too short
now, Wendla!
Wendla—Have you got meat for dinner already,
motherkin?
Mrs. Bergmann—God bless you and keep you!—I
must find time to sew another breadth of ruffles
round your skirt.
CURTAIN
[49]
Scene III.—A toilet—not to be thought of as
equipped with modern plumbing. Hansy Rilow
enters, a light in his hand; bolts the door and
opens the lid.
Hansy—Hast thou prayed to-night, Desdemona?
[He draws from his bosom a reproduction of the
Venus of Palma Vecchio.] I shouldn’t say you
looked like “Our Father Who Art in Heaven,”
darling:—awaiting contemplatively whoever may be
coming, just as in that delicious moment of dawning
rapture when I beheld thee lying in Schlesinger’s
shop-window—these supple limbs just as beguiling
still, these softly swelling hips, these young, upstanding
breasts!—Oh, how giddy with joy must the great
master have felt when the fourteen-year-old original
lay stretched on the divan before his eyes!
And wilt thou sometimes visit me in dreams? With
eager arms will I receive thee, and kiss thee till thy
breath is gone. Thou wilt take possession of me as
the lawful heiress takes possession of her desolated
castle. Gate and door spring open as by invisible
hands, and below in the park the fountain joyously
begins to plash!
“It is the cause! It is the cause!”—That I am
not lightly moved to murder thee, thou may’st learn
[50]
from the fearful throbbing in my breast. My throat
contracts at the thought of my lonely nights. I
swear to thee, dear, upon my soul, it is not satiety
inspires me! Who would dare boast that he was
satiated with thee?
But thou dost suck the marrow from my bones!
Thou crook’st my back, and rob’st my eyes of their
last gleam of youth. You claim too much of me
with your inhuman coyness, you wear me out with
your unmoving limbs!—It’s you or I!—and I who
have prevailed!
If I should count them up—those vanished ones
with all of whom I have fought this same fight here!—Psyche
by Thumann—one legacy yet from that
dried-up Mlle. Angelique, that rattlesnake in the
Eden of my childhood; Io by Correggio; Galathea by
Lossow; then an Amor of Bouguereau’s; Ada by
J. van Beers—that Ada whom I had to abduct
from a secret drawer in father’s desk, to add her to
my harem; a quivering, thrilling Leda by Makart,
that I found by chance among my brother’s college
lecture-notes; seven, O thou doomed in thy perfect
flower, who have rushed before thee down this path
into Tartarus! Let that give thee comfort, and seek
not to heighten my pangs into agony with these
supplicating looks!
Thou diest not for thy sins, but for mine!
Need to defend myself against myself drives me
with bleeding heart to do this seventh murder on
a mate. There is something tragic in the rôle
of Bluebeard. I guess that all his murdered wives
[51]
together suffered less than he did in the strangling
of each single one.
But my conscience will grow calmer and my body
stronger when thou, she-devil, residest no longer
in the red-silk cushions of my jewel-casket. Then
in thy stead I will have the Lorelei of Bodenhausen
or the Forsaken Lass of Linger or the Loni of
Defregger occupy that voluptuous pleasure-chamber—provided
I shall have recovered the quicker for
this! A bare three months more, perhaps, and your
unveiled Jehoshaphat, sweet soul, would have begun
devouring my poor brain as the sun a butter-ball.
It was high time to effect the separation from bed
and board!
Brrr! I feel a Heliogabalus in me! Moritura me
salutat!—O girl, girl, why do you press your knees
together?—why still even now,—in the face of inscrutable
eternity?—One spasm, and I will let thee
live! One feminine movement, one sign of sensuality,
of sympathy, girl! and I will frame thee in gold and
hang thee above my bed. Art thou not conscious
that it is thy purity, nothing more, begets my
excesses? Woe, woe to the unhuman!
Anyone can see that she’s had the advantage of
a model education!—Well, so have I too.
Hast thou prayed to-night, Desdemona?
My heart contracts in convulsions—— Silly!—Holy
St. Agnes died for her continence too, and was
not half so naked as thou!—One more kiss on your
virginal body, your child-like, budding breast, your
sweetly rounded—cruel, unyielding knees....
[52]
It is the cause, it is the cause, my soul.
Let me not name it to you, you chaste stars!
It is the cause!⁠——
[The picture falls into the depths. He shuts
the lid.]
CURTAIN
[53]
Scene IV.—A hayloft. Murky light, the smell of
fresh hay, Melchior lying in it. Wendla
comes up the ladder.
Wendla—So here’s where you hid! Everybody’s
looking for you. The wagon’s gone out
again. You must help. There’s a storm coming
up.
Melchior—Get away from me!—Get away
from me!
Wendla—What’s the matter with you?—Why
do you hide your face?
Melchior—Get out! Get out!—Or I’ll throw
you down on the barn-floor!
Wendla—Now I certainly won’t go. [She kneels
beside him.] Why won’t you come out on the hayfield
with us, Melchior? Here it’s so sultry and
dark! What if we do get wet to the skin—we
don’t care!
Melchior—The hay smells so wonderful.—The
sky outside must be as black as a pall.—I can’t see
anything but the gleaming poppy at your breast,—and
your heart, I hear it beating!⁠——
Wendla—Don’t kiss me, Melchior!—Don’t
kiss me!
Melchior—Your heart—I hear it beating⁠——
[54]
Wendla—People love each other—when they
kiss—— Don’t! Don’t!⁠——
Melchior—Oh, believe me, there’s no such thing
as love!—Self-seeking, egoism,—that’s all there is!—I
love you as little as you love me.⁠——
Wendla—Don’t!———— Don’t, Melchior!⁠——
Melchior— ... Wendla!
Wendla—Oh, Melchior!——don’t—don’t⁠——
CURTAIN
[55]
Scene V.—Mrs. Gabor sits and writes.
[Or else she may be shown in a dark room, in
silhouette against the window, reading her letter
over by its failing light.]
Mrs. Gabor—My dear Moritz Stiefel!
I take up my pen with a heavy heart after twenty-four
hours of considering and reconsidering everything
that you write me. The money for passage to
America I am not able, I give you my solemn word,
to furnish you. In the first place I have not that
much at my disposal, and in the second, even if I had,
it would be doing you the greatest wrong I can
imagine to put into your hands the means of carrying
out so rash and critical a venture. You would do
me bitter injustice, Moritz Stiefel, if you saw in
this refusal of mine any sign of failing affection.
On the contrary, it would be the grossest failure in
my duty as your friend and counselor for me to
be willing to let your momentary loss of judgment
cause me too to lose my head and blindly follow
my first, most natural impulses. I am willing and
ready, if you wish me to, to write to your parents
and try to convince them that throughout the course
of this last term you have done all you could and
drawn so heavily upon your strength that a severe
attitude towards what has happened to you would
[56]
not only be unwarranted but, more seriously, might
have the gravest effect upon your mental and physical
health.
Your implied threat that you will take your own
life in case your flight is not made feasible has—to
speak frankly, Moritz,—rather taken me aback. No
matter how undeserved a misfortune may be, we
should never let ourselves be driven to ignoble
measures. The way in which you seem to wish to
make me—who have never shown you anything but
kindness—answerable for a possible shocking outrage
on your part, might, to a person inclined to think
evil, look very much like blackmail. I must confess
that this mode of acting from you, who usually are
so well aware of what a man owes himself, was the
very last I should have expected. For the present,
I cherish the firm conviction that you were still
suffering too much from the first shock to be able
to realize fully what you were doing.
And so I am confidently hoping that these words
of mine will find you already in a more composed
state of mind. Take the affair as it stands. To my
way of thinking, it is wholly inadmissible that a
young man should be judged by his school marks.
We have too many examples of very bad scholars
who have become remarkable men, and conversely of
excellent scholars who have not distinguished themselves
in life. In any case I assure you that so far
as I am concerned your mishap will not cause any
change in your relations with Melchior. It will
always give me pleasure to see my son in the
[57]
company of a young man who—let the world judge
of him as it will—deserved and won not only his
but my most cordial sympathy.
And so—up with your chin, Moritz Stiefel! Such
crises, of this kind or of that, come upon us all
and must just be got over. If everyone so placed
should snatch forthwith at dagger and poison, there
might easily soon be no more men and women in the
world. Let us hear from you soon again, and believe
me cordially and steadfastly
Your maternal friend,
Fanny G.

Scene VI.—The Bergmann Garden in the radiance
of the morning sun.
Wendla—[Discovered.] Why have you stolen
out of the house?—To look for violets!—Because
mother sees me smiling.—And why can’t you stop,
and shut your lips tight any more?—I don’t know.—Oh,
I don’t know—I can’t find words....
The path is like a plush carpet underfoot—not
one little stone, not a thorn.—My feet don’t touch
the ground.... Oh, how I did sleep last night.
Here’s where they used to be. [Kneels.] They
make me feel as solemn as a nun at communion.—Dear
violets!—All right, motherling! I’ll put on
my penitence-dress!—Oh, God, if somebody would
only come whom I could hug and tell!
CURTAIN
[59]
Scene VII.—Twilight. The sky is lightly overcast.
The path winds through low growth and sedgegrass.
Not far away the river sounds. Moritz
sits facing the audience, his back to some bushes
and the path.
Moritz—It is better so.—I don’t fit in. Let them
mount and climb upon each other’s heads.—I will
pull the door to behind me, and step into the open.
I won’t pay so much just to let myself be pushed
around.
I didn’t put myself forward. Why should I put
myself forward now?—I have no compact with God.
Let them distort the thing any way they have a mind
to. I was pressed.—I don’t say my parents are
responsible. After all, they had to be prepared
for the worst. They were old enough to know
what they were doing. I was an infant when I
came into the world—otherwise even I might have
been cunning enough to become another person.
Why should I pay the penalty for all the others’
being there already!
I suppose I must have fallen on my head....
If anyone gives me a present of a mad dog, I give
him his mad dog back; and if he won’t take his mad
dog back, then I am humane and....
Yes, I just must have fallen on my head!
[60]
One is born quite by accident, and yet, after the
most mature consideration, one is not supposed
to—— It’s enough to make one shoot one’s self
dead!
At least the weather shows that it sympathizes.
All day it’s looked like rain, but it’s still holding
off.—A rare peace is brooding over nature: nowhere
anything sharp or exciting; heaven and earth like
a transparent spider’s-web. And everything seems
to feel so well. The landscape lovely as a lullaby—“Schlafe,
mein Prinzchen, schlaf’ ein,” as Fraülein
Snandulia sang. Too bad she holds her elbows
awkwardly!—It was at the feast of St. Cecilia I
danced for the last time. Snandulia only dances at
parties. Her silk dress was cut so low, back and
front—behind down to the belt at her waist, and in
front low enough to take away your wits.—She
can’t have had a chemise on....
That would be something that might stop me yet!—More
just for curiosity.—It must be an extraordinary
sensation—a feeling as if one were being
swept down a torrent—— I shan’t tell anybody
that I’ve come back with the thing undone. I shall
act as if I had taken part in all that.... It’s
rather mortifying, to have been human and not got
to know the most human thing of all.—You come
from Egypt, my dear sir, and have not seen the
pyramids?!
I don’t want to cry again to-day. I don’t want
to think any more about my funeral—— Melchior
will lay a wreath upon my casket; Pastor Kahlbauch
[61]
will console my parents; old Sonnenstich will
cite parallels from history.—A gravestone I probably
won’t get. I should have liked an urn of
snowy marble on a black syenite base,—but, praise
God, I shan’t miss it! Memorials are for the living,
not for the dead.
I should need a year to take leave of everything
in my thoughts. I don’t want to cry again. I
am so happy that I can look back without bitterness.
How many lovely evenings I have spent with
Melchior!—under the river willows, at the forester’s
hut, on the highroad out there where the five lindens
stand, up on castle hill among the peaceful ruins
of Runenburg—— When the hour has come, I
shall think with all my might of whipped cream.
Whipped cream doesn’t sustain you, but it’s filling
and leaves a pleasant taste.... And I had
thought mankind was infinitely worse. I haven’t
found a soul that wouldn’t have wanted to do his
best; and many a one I have pitied on my account.
I pass to the altar like the youth in ancient
Etruria whose dying rattle buys his brothers’ prosperity
through the coming year.—One by one I go
through all the mysterious shudders of deliverance.
I gulp with sorrow at my fate.—Life has given
me the cold shoulder. From up there I see grave,
friendly looks beckon me: the headless queen, the
headless queen—sympathy with soft arms awaiting
me.... Your tenders are for children; I carry my
free pass within myself. Sinks the shell, off sails
the butterfly: the dream besets us no more.—You
[62]
should play no mad games with the fraud! The mist
dissolves: life is a matter of taste. [His shoulder is
suddenly grabbed from behind by Ilse.]
Ilse—[In torn clothes, a gay kerchief round her
head.] What have you lost?
Moritz—[Starting to his feet.] Ilse!
Ilse—What are you looking for here?
Moritz—What d’you frighten me so for?
Ilse—What is it? What have you lost?
Moritz—But why did you startle me so awfully?
Ilse—I’ve just come from the city.—I’m going
home.
Moritz—I don’t know, what I’ve lost.
Ilse—Then it’s no good your looking. [Moritz
swears.] It’s four days since I was home.
Moritz—Sneaking like a cat!
Ilse—That’s ’cause I’ve got my dancing-slippers
on.—Mother will make eyes!—Come along to the
house with me!
Moritz—Where have you been bumming around
again?
Ilse—In Priapia!
Moritz—Priapia?
Ilse—At Nohl’s, at Fehrendorf’s, at Padinsky’s,—with
Lenz, Rank, Spühler,—with everybody you
can think of!—Kling, kling,—she will jump!
Moritz—Are they painting you?
Ilse—Fehrendorf’s painting me as St. Stylites,
standing on a Corinthian capital. Fehrendorf, I
must tell you, is a mess.⁠[3] Last time I stepped on
[63]
one of his tubes. Squashed it. He wipes his brush
on my hair. I give him one on the ear. He throws
his palette at my head. I knock the easel over. He
gets after me with the maulstick over couch and
tables and chairs, all round the studio. Behind
the stove lay a sketch! Be good, or I’ll tear it!—He
swore amnesty, and then for a finishing touch he
kissed me—kissed me, oh, something terrible!
Moritz—Where do you spend the night when you
stay in town?
Ilse—Last night we were at Nohl’s; night before
at Boyokevitch’s; Sunday with Oikonomopulos. At
Padinsky’s there was champagne. Valabregez had
sold his “Man Sick with the Plague.” Adolar drank
out of the ash-tray. Lenz sang “The Murd’ress of
Her Child,” and Adolar played the guitar to pieces.
I was so drunk they had to put me to bed.—You’re
still going to school all the time, Moritz?
Moritz—No, no—this term, I’m getting out.
Ilse—You’re right. Oh, how the time flies when
you’re earning money!—D’you remember how we
used to play robbers?—Wendla Bergmann and you
and I and the rest, when you all came out in the
evening and drank new, warm goat’s milk at our
house?—What’s Wendla doing? I remember seeing
her at the flood.—What’s Melchi Gabor doing?—Does
he still gaze so deeply into things?—In singing-lesson
we used to stand opposite each other.
Moritz—He philosophizes.
Ilse—Wendla came to see us a while ago, and
brought mother some preserves. I was sitting that
[64]
day for Isidor Landauer. He’s using me for Holy
Mary, the Mother of God, with the Christ-child.
He’s a ninny, and disgusting. Whew! like a weathercock!—Have
you got a “morning after” headache?
Moritz—From last night. We swilled like hippopotamuses.
It was five o’clock when I staggered
home.
Ilse—One only needs to look at you.—Were there
girls there?
Moritz—Arabella, the bar-maid,—a Spanish girl.
The landlord left us all, the whole night through,
alone with her.
Ilse—One only needs to look at you, Moritz.—I
never have these morning-afters! Last Carnival
I went for three days and three nights without getting
into a bed, or even out of my clothes. From
masquerade ball to café; noontimes at the Bellavista,
evenings at the cabaret, nights to another ball! Lena
was along, and fatty Viola.—The third night, Henry
found me.
Moritz—Had he been looking for you?
Ilse—He’d stumbled over my arm. I was lying
senseless in the gutter-snow.—So then I joined up
with him. For two weeks I never left his lodgings.
That was a horrible time!—Mornings I had to throw
on his Persian dressing-gown, and evenings walk
about the room in a black page’s costume—white lace
at the collar, cuffs, and knees. Every day he’d photograph
me in a new arrangement: one time on the back
of the sofa, as Ariadne, another time as Leda, another
as Ganymede, and once on all fours as a female
[65]
Nebuchadnezzar. And then he would rave about
killing—about shooting, suicide, and charcoal fumes.
Early mornings he’d bring a pistol into bed, load it
full of cartridges and poke it into my breast: one
wink, and I’ll fire!—Oh, he would have fired, Moritz;
he would have fired!—Then he’d stick the thing in his
mouth like a bean-shooter. Maybe that would wake
my instinct for self-preservation! And then—Brrr!
the bullet would have gone through my spine.
Moritz—Is Henry still alive?
Ilse—How do I know?—Over the bed was a mirror
let into the ceiling. The little room looked
tower-high and bright as an opera-house. You saw
yourself actually hanging downwards from the sky.
I had the most frightful dreams at night.—God,
O God, when would it be day again!—Good night,
Ilse. When you sleep you’re beautiful for murder!
Moritz—Is this Henry still alive?
Ilse—God willing, no!—One day when he went to
get some absinthe I threw my cloak on and slipped
out onto the street. The Carnival was over. The
police snapped me up. What was I after in men’s
clothes?—They took me to headquarters, and there
came Nohl, Fehrendorf, Padinsky, Spühler, Oikonomopulos,
the whole Priapia, and bailed me out.
In a cab they transported me to Adolar’s studio.
Ever since I’ve been true to the gang. Fehrendorf
is a monkey, Nohl is a pig, Boyokevitch an owl,
Loison a hyena, Oikonomopulos a camel—but that’s
why I love them one and all the same, and don’t care
[66]
to tie up to anyone else, though the world were full
of archangels and millionaires!
Moritz—I must go back, Ilse.
Ilse—Come with me as far as our house.
Moritz—What for?—What for?
Ilse—[Kidding him.] To drink fresh, warm
goat’s milk!—I’ll singe your forelock and hang a
little bell around your neck. And we still have a
rocking-horse that you can play with.
Moritz—I must get back. I still have the Sassanids,
the Sermon on the Mount and the parallelepipedon
on my conscience.—Good night, Ilse.
Ilse—Sweet dreams!—Do you ever go down to
the wigwam any more, where Melchi Gabor buried
my tomahawk?—Brrr! Before you catch on, I’ll lie
in the dust-bin! [She hurries off.]
Moritz—One word, it would have cost.—[Calls.]
Ilse!—Ilse!—— Praise God, she doesn’t hear!
—I am not in the mood.—For that, one needs a
clear head and a joyful heart.—Too bad, too bad
the chance is lost!
... I shall say that I have had huge crystal
mirrors over my beds—and have trained an unruly
filly—and made her prance before me across the carpet
in long black silk stockings and patent-leather
shoes, and long black kid gloves and black velvet
around her neck;—and how I stifled her in my pillows,
in an access of madness.... I shall smile
when the talk is of lust.... I shall⁠——
scream!—I shall scream!—Oh to be
you, Ilse!—Priapia!—Unconsciousness!—That
[67]
takes away my power!—This
favorite of fortune, this
sunny creature, this daughter of
joy upon my dolorous path!—Oh!—Oh!
[He staggers across the path and falls under the
high, dark, cavernous bushes on the further side,
crawling towards the river.]
So have I found it again without trying, the grassy
bank? The mulleins seem to have grown since yesterday.
The vista between the willows is the same still.
The river is flowing heavily like melted lead. Don’t
let me forget.... [He draws Mrs. Gabor’s letter
from his pocket, lights a match, and burns it.]—How
the sparks fly—back and forth—up and down!—Souls!—Shooting
stars!⁠——
Before I lit the match you could still see the
grasses and a strip of the horizon.—Now it’s gotten
dark. Now I’m not going home any more.
CURTAIN
[68]
Scene I.—The Faculty Room. Two small, high windows,
one of them walled up. Portraits of
Pestalozzi and J. J. Rousseau on the walls.
Long, narrow, green table, with a gaspipe and
six flaring burners over it. At one end, on a
platform, Principal Sonnenstich⁠[4] sits. Behind
the table sit, quite close together, in a grotesque
row, Professors Affenschmalz (nearest
Sonnenstich), Knochenbruch, Fliegentod,
Hungergurt, Zungenschlag, and Knüppeldick.
Habebald, the beadle or proctor of the
school, cowers near the door.
Sonnenstich—May one of the gentlemen perhaps
have something further to remark?—Gentlemen!—If
we find ourselves unable to avoid the necessity of
moving the rustication of our crime-laden pupil before
a superior Board of Education, it is for the very
weightiest reasons that we cannot help it. We cannot
if only to do our best to atone for the misfortune
that has already burst upon us; still less if we would
insure our institution for the future against further
calamities of the same order. We cannot if we are
to discipline our crime-laden pupil for the demoralizing
[69]
influence that he has exerted upon his classmates;
we cannot, most conclusively, if so we may prevent
him from exerting the like influence upon the remainder
of his classmates. We are compelled to it—and
this, gentlemen, is perhaps the most fundamental
ground of all, against which no protest can prevail,—because
it is for us to protect our institution from
the ravages of a suicide-epidemic, such as has
already broken out at various schools like ours and
has so far defied all efforts to attach the schoolboy
to those conditions of existence best adapted to his
education into cultivated manhood.—May one of the
gentlemen still have something to remark?
Knüppeldick—[Furthest away; middle-aged.]
I can no longer repel the conviction that it may at
last be about time to open a window somewhere.
Zungenschlag—[Next him, bearded, choleric.]
There—there prevails here an at-at-atmosphere like
that in subterranean cata-catacombs, like tha-tha-that
in the archive-repositories of the quo-quondam
star-chamber tribunal at We-Wetzlar!
Sonnenstich—Habebald!
Habebald—Yes, Mr. Sonnenstich?
Sonnenstich—Open a window. We have, Heaven
be praised, atmosphere enough out-of-doors.—May
one of the gentlemen have anything further to remark?
Fliegentod—[The Secretary, with the minutebook;
bearded, ponderous.] If my worthy colleagues
wish to have a window opened, I have nothing, personally,
to object against it; only might I ask that
[70]
they will not wish to have that window opened which
is directly at my back?
Sonnenstich—Habebald!
Habebald—Yes, Mr. Sonnenstich?
Sonnenstich—Open the other window!—May one
of the gentlemen have something still further to
remark?
Hungergurt—[Small, mild, spectacled; between
Fliegentod and Zungenschlag.] Without any
wish on my part to aggravate the controversy, might
I recall the fact that the other window has been
walled up since the autumn holidays?
Sonnenstich—Habebald!
Habebald—Yes, Mr. Sonnenstich?
Sonnenstich—Leave the other window closed!—I
see myself compelled, gentlemen, to bring the matter
to a vote. I request those colleagues who are for
opening the only window that can enter into the question,
to indicate it by standing. [The three furthest
from him stand.] One, two three. [Counting the
seated ones, too.] One, two, three. Habebald!
Habebald—Yes, Mr. Sonnenstich?
Sonnenstich—Leave the one window likewise
closed.—I for my part am of the opinion that our
atmosphere leaves nothing to be desired!—May one
of the gentlemen still have something to remark?—Gentlemen!—Let
us make the supposition that we
omit to move the rustication of our crime-laden
pupil before a superior Board of Education. We
will then be held accountable, by the Ministry of
Education, for the disaster that has befallen us. Of
[71]
the various schools that have been visited by this
suicide-epidemic, those in which twenty-five per cent
of the pupils have fallen victims to the ravages of the
suicide-epidemic have been temporarily closed by
the Ministry of Education. To preserve our Institution
from this most staggering blow is our duty, as
the guardians and safekeepers of our institution. It
grieves us deeply, gentlemen and colleagues, that we
are in no position to let our crime-laden pupil’s
qualifications in other respects count as mitigating
circumstances. A mild procedure, which might be
justifiable towards our crime-laden pupil singly, is
at this time, when the very existence of our institution
is imperilled in the most dangerous manner conceivable,
certainly not justifiable! We see ourselves
reduced to the necessity of passing judgment on the
guilty lest we, the innocent, be judged.—Habebald!
Habebald—Yes, Mr. Sonnenstich?
Sonnenstich—Bring him up. [Habebald goes
out.]
Zungenschlag—If it is settled that the pre-prevailing
a-a-a-atmosphere leaves little or nothing to
be desired, I should like to move that during the summer
vacation the other window as well should be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be
walled up!
Fliegentod—If our dear colleague Zungenschlag
does not find our sanctum satisfactorily ventilated, I
should like to set the machinery in motion toward
having a ventilator installed in our dear colleague
Zungenschlag’s high and cavernous brow.
Zungenschlag—Th-th-that is too much for me
[72]
to put up with!—Ru-rudenesses are more than I need
to put up with!—I am in possession of my five
senses...!
Sonnenstich—I must request our colleagues,
Messrs. Fliegentod and Zungenschlag, to preserve
decorum. I think I hear our crime-laden pupil already
on the stairs. [Habebald opens the door,
whereupon Melchior, pale but composed, steps before
the assemblage.] Step up nearer to the table.—When
Mr. Stiefel had been informed of his son’s
impious and wicked act, he searched in his grief and
perplexity among the effects that his son Moritz had
left behind him, in hopes that so he might happen
to find the moving cause of that abominable outrage.
So doing, he stumbled, in an irrelevant place, upon a
piece of writing which, without yet making the abominable
outrage understandable in itself, yet offers,
I regret to say, an explanation only too conclusive
of the moral obliquity in the criminal which must
have underlain his act. I am speaking of a twenty-page
treatise in dialogue form entitled “Coition,” accompanied
by life-sized drawings, rank with the most
shameless obscenities, and responding to the most
perverted demands that a depraved debauchee could
possibly make upon lascivious literature⁠——
Melchior—I have⁠——
Sonnenstich—You have to keep quiet.—Mr.
Stiefel handed this manuscript over to us, and we
promised the distracted father at any cost to identify
its author. The handwriting was accordingly compared
with the hands of each one of the dead profligate’s
[73]
schoolmates, and it proved, in the unanimous
judgment of the whole faculty and in perfect accord
with the specialist’s opinion of our esteemed colleague
in calligraphy, to have the closest conceivable similarity
to yours⁠——
Melchior—I have⁠——
Sonnenstich—You have to keep quiet.—Notwithstanding
the crushing fact that this resemblance
has been marked by unimpeachable authorities, we
believe that we may refrain for the moment from taking
any further steps till we have first circumstantially
interrogated the guilty student concerning his
crime against morals, in conjunction with the instigation
to self-murder arising from it, with which he is
accordingly charged.
Melchior—I have⁠——
Sonnenstich—You have to answer to the particular
questions which I shall put to you, in order, one
after the other, with a simple, modest “Yes” or “No.”—Habebald!
Habebald—Yes, Mr. Sonnenstich?
Sonnenstich—The documents!—I trust that our
Secretary, Mr. Fliegentod, will from now on record
the proceedings as nearly verbatim as possible. [To
Melchior.] Do you recognize this manuscript?
Melchior—Yes.
Sonnenstich—Do you know what this manuscript
contains?
Melchior—Yes.
Sonnenstich—Is the writing in this manuscript
yours?
[74]
Melchior—Yes.
Sonnenstich—Does this obscene manuscript originate
from you?
Melchior—Yes.—I beg you, Mr. Sonnenstich, to
show me one obscenity in it.
Sonnenstich—You are to answer the particular
questions I put to you with a simple, modest “Yes”
or “No”!
Melchior—I have written no more and no less
than what is very well known to you to be fact.
Sonnenstich—Insolence.
Melchior—I ask you to show me one offense
against morals in that paper!
Sonnenstich—Do you imagine I’d have a mind to
act the clown for you? Habebald!...
Melchior—I have⁠——
Sonnenstich—You have as little respect for the
dignity of your assembled teachers as you have decent
sensibility for mankind’s inbred feeling for the
modesty of the shamefastness of the moral order of
the world!—Habebald!
Habebald—Yes, Mr. Sonnenstich?
Sonnenstich—It’s in fact the Langenscheidt for
the learning in three hours of agglutinative Volapük!⁠[5]
Melchior—I have⁠——
Sonnenstich—I instruct our Secretary, Mr. Fliegentod,
to close the minutes!
[75]
Melchior—I have⁠——
Sonnenstich—You have to keep quiet!—Habebald.
Habebald—Yes, Mr. Sonnenstich?
Sonnenstich—Take him down!
CURTAIN
[76]
Scene II.—A graveyard seen through pouring rain.
Gray stone wall about five feet high, and quite
close to it, parallel with it, an open grave, behind
which stands Pastor Kahlbauch, umbrella
in left hand and prayer-book in right,
flanked by Moritz’s father, his friend Ziegenmelker,
and Uncle Probst, on the right, and
Principal Sonnenstich and Professor
Knochenbruch, with a string of schoolboys,
on the left. At a little distance, by a half-collapsed
monument, are Ilse and Martha.
Pastor Kahlbauch— ... For he who rejects
the mercy wherewith the Eternal Father has blest
man born in sin, he shall die a spiritual death. He
who in wilful, carnal denial of God’s proper honor
liveth for evil and serveth it, he shall die the death
of the body. He, however, who wantonly throws
from him the cross which the All-merciful has laid
upon him for his sins, verily, verily, I say unto you,
he will die the everlasting death!—[He closes the
book and puts it in his pocket, takes a shovel from
the wall-face and with it pushes some mud into the
grave, and hands the shovel to Mr. Stiefel.]—Let
us, however, faithful pilgrims upon the thorny way,
praise the Lord, the All-bountiful, and render him
thanks for his inscrutable elections. For as truly
[77]
as this soul did die a threefold death, so truly will
God the Lord induct the righteous man into bliss
and the Life Everlasting.—Amen.
Mr. Stiefel—[His voice thick with tears.] The
boy was none of mine!—The boy was none of mine!—The
boy never pleased me from childhood up!
[He throws a shovelful of mud into the grave, and
gives the shovel back. Pastor Kahlbauch hands
it to Professor Sonnenstich.]
Sonnenstich—[Throws a shovelful of mud into
the grave.] Self-murder as the most serious conceivable
offense against the moral order of the world
is the most perfect conceivable demonstration of the
moral order of the world, in that the suicide relieves
the moral order of the world from passing judgment
upon him, and establishes its existence. [He passes
the shovel to Professor Knochenbruch.]
Prof. Knochenbruch—[Throws a shovelful of
mud into the grave.] Defective—depraved—delinquent—decayed—and
detrited! [He walks around
the grave and hands the shovel to Uncle Probst.]
Uncle Probst—[Throws a shovelful of mud into
the grave.] Not from my very mother would I have
believed a child could act so basely toward his parents!
[Hands the shovel to Ziegenmelker.]
Ziegenmelker—[Throws a shovelful of mud into
the grave.] Toward a father who for twenty years
now has had no thought, early or late, but for his
child’s welfare! [Puts the shovel back against the
wall.]
Pastor Kahlbauch—[Pressing Mr. Stiefel’s
[78]hand.] We know that for them that love God all
things work together for good. 1 Corinth. 12, 15.—Think
of the sorrowing mother, and strive by redoubled
love to make up to her for her loss. [He
squeezes out past the Professors and boys.]
Sonnenstich—[Pressing Mr. Stiefel’s hand.]
We would probably not have been able to promote
him, anyway. [Stiefel passes him.]
Knochenbruch—[Pressing Mr. Stiefel’s
hand.] And if we had promoted him, next spring
he would most assuredly have failed to pass.
Uncle Probst—[Coming round in front and
pressing Stiefel’s hand.] Now your first duty is
to think of yourself. You’re the father of a family!...
Ziegenmelker—[Doing likewise.] Rely on me.
I’ll steer you!—Beastly weather! enough to make
one’s guts crawl. Whoever doesn’t get after that
right away with a stiff drink ’ll be taken off with
heart-failure! [Leads him toward Pastor Kahlbauch.]
Mr. Stiefel—[Blowing his nose.] The boy was
none of mine.... The boy was none of mine....
[Kahlbauch takes his other arm. All the men pass
off.—The rain lets up. Hansy Rilow slips in behind
the grave.]
Hansy Rilow—[Throwing in a shovelful of mud.]
Rest in peace, old fellow!—Greet my immortal
brides from me, immolated memories; and commend
me most humbly to the dear Lord’s mercy—poor
dumbbell you!—They’ll put up a scarecrow on your
[79]
grave here yet, in memory of your angel simpleness....
George—Has the pistol been found?
Robert—No one need hunt for a pistol!
Ernest—Did you see him, Robert?
Robert—A God-damned swindle, I call it.—Who
did see him?—Who!
Otto—Yeah, that’s the sore point!—They’d
thrown a cloth over him.
George—Was his tongue hanging out?
Robert—His eyes!—That’s why they’d thrown
the cloth over.
Otto—[Shuddering.] Grrr!
Hansy—Do you know for sure that he hanged
himself?
Ernest—I’ve heard that his whole head was
gone.
Otto—Nonsense! Rot!
Robert—Why, I’ve had the noose in my hands!—I
never saw a hanged body yet that you wouldn’t
have covered up.
George—He couldn’t have taken his leave in a
vulgarer way.
Hansy—What the devil,—hanging is said to be
quite handsome!
Otto—I’ve got five marks still owing me from
him. We had a bet. He swore he’d keep his place.
Hansy—It’s your fault that he’s lying there. You
called him a boaster.
Otto—Poppycock! I’ve got to grind thru the
nights, too. If he’d learned the history of ancient
[80]
Greek literature, he wouldn’t have had to hang himself!
[Turns to go.]
Ernest—Have you done your composition, Otto?
Otto—Just the introduction.
Ernest—I haven’t the least idea what to write.
George—What, weren’t you there when Affenschmalz
gave us the choice of subject?
Hansy—I’m going to fake up something out of
Democritus.
Ernest—I want to see if Meyer’s Abridged has
anything left I can use.
Otto—[As all disappear.] Have you done your
Virgil for to-morrow?—[When they are gone, Martha
and Ilse come to the grave.]
Ilse—Quick! quick!—There come the grave-diggers
off there.
Martha—Hadn’t we better wait, Ilse?
Ilse—What for?—We’ll bring new ones, and
more, and more!—There are enough growing.
Martha—You’re right, Ilse!—[She throws an
ivy-wreath into the grave. Ilse opens her apron
and lets a shower of fresh anemones rain upon the
coffin.]—I’ll dig up our roses. What if I am beaten
for it?—Here they’ll bloom well.
Ilse—I will water them as often as I go past.
I’ll bring forget-me-nots over from the brook, and
irises from the house.
Martha—It ought to be glorious!—glorious!
Ilse—I was just over the bridge up there when
I heard the shot.
Martha—Poor heart!
[81]
Ilse—And I know the reason too, Martha.
Martha—Did he tell you something?
Ilse—Parallelepipedon!—But don’t tell anybody.
Martha—I won’t.—There’s my hand.
Ilse—Here is the pistol.
Martha—That’s why it couldn’t be found!
Ilse—I took it right out of his hand when I went
past in the morning.
Martha—Give it to me, Ilse!—Please, give it
to me!
Ilse—No, I’m going to keep it for remembrance.
Martha—Is it true, Ilse, that he’s lying in there
without a head?
Ilse—He must have loaded it with water!—The
mulleins were spattered all over with blood. His
brains hung round on the osiers.
CURTAIN
[82]
Scene III.—Mr. and Mrs. Gabor face each other,
the window between them, lighting them.
Mrs. Gabor— ... They were in need of a scapegoat.
They couldn’t disregard the accusations
that were springing up on every side against them.
And now that my son has had the ill luck to fall foul
of the old pedants at the precise moment, now am
I, his own mother, to help to complete his executioners’
work?—God preserve me from it!
Mr. Gabor—I have looked on at your ingenious
educational methods for fourteen years in silence.
They were contrary to my ideas. I had always lived
under the persuasion that a child was not a plaything,
that a child had a claim upon our most earnest
efforts. But I said to myself, if the grace and
esprit of one parent are able to take the place of
the other’s serious principles, why, they may be
preferable to the serious principles.—I am not blaming
you, Fanny; but don’t stand in my way when
I am trying to make good to the boy the wrong
that both you and I have done him.
Mrs. Gabor—I will stand in your way as long as
a drop of blood runs warm in my veins! In a House
of Correction my child will be lost. A criminal nature
may perhaps be bettered in such institutions.—I
don’t know. A child naturally good will there as
[83]
certainly become criminal as a plant degenerates
when deprived of air and sun. I am conscious of
no wrong done him. I thank God to-day as always
that He showed me the way to awaken in my child
an upright character and noble mind. What has
he done then that’s so dreadful?—I haven’t the least
idea of trying to exculpate him!—For being turned
out of school he needs no exculpation; and if he
were at fault, he has paid for it.—You may know
better about all that; you may be perfectly right
theoretically. But I cannot let my only child be
driven and forced to his destruction!
Mr. Gabor—That does not depend upon us,
Fanny. That is a risk that we took upon ourselves
along with our happiness. He that is too feeble for
the march is left by the wayside. And it is surely
not so bad as it might be, if the inevitable comes in
time. May Heaven defend us from it! Our duty
is to steady the waverer as long as reason can find
means to do it.—That he has been expelled from
school is not his fault. If he had not been expelled
from school, that wouldn’t have been his fault,
either.—You take things too lightly. You see only
inquisitive trifling where fundamental lesions of character
are really involved. You women are not qualified
to judge such things. Anyone who can write
what Melchior writes must be degenerate at the innermost
core of his being. His essence is tainted.
No nature that’s half-way healthy permits itself
that sort of thing. We are all of us flesh and blood:
every one of us strays from the strict, true path.
[84]
But what he has written represents a principle.
What he has written is no chance, casual slip, but
documentary proof, of ghastly clarity, of that
frankly affected purpose, that natural propensity,
that bent toward the immoral because it is
immoral!—it manifests that exceptional spiritual
corruption that we jurists designate as moral imbecility.—Whether
his condition can be in any way
remedied, I am not able to say. If we would retain
one glimmer of hope,—and, before all, consciences as
his parents free from remorse,—we must apply ourselves
with decision and in all earnestness to the
task.—Let us cease contention, Fanny! I am sensible
how hard for you it is. I know you idolize
him, because he suits so perfectly your gifted temperament.
But be stronger than yourself. Show
yourself for once at last unselfish toward your son!
Mrs. Gabor—God help me, how can I prevail
against that!—One must be a man, to be able to
say such things! One must be a man to let oneself
be so blinded by the dead letter! One must be a man
to close his eyes to what stares him in the face!—I
have acted toward Melchior conscientiously and
carefully from the first day I found him susceptible
to impressions from his environment. Are we responsible
for accident? You may be struck
down to-morrow by a falling tile, and along will come
your friend, your father, and instead of tending
your wounds set his foot upon your head!—I will
not let my child be ruined before my very eyes!
Would I be his mother if I did?—It is unthinkable!
[85]
It is utterly out of the question. What in the world
did he write then, after all? Isn’t it the most blatant
proof of his innocence, of his ignorance, of his childish
immaturity, that he can write such things?—You
can have no inkling of knowledge of human
nature, you must be an utterly soulless bureaucrat,
or unbelievably narrow, to smell out moral corruption
here!—Say what you like: if you put Melchior
in the House of Correction, we must separate—and
then let me see if nowhere in the world I can find help
and means to snatch my child from his downfall!
Mr. Gabor—You will have to reconcile yourself
to it—if not to-day, to-morrow. To discount misfortune
comes hard to everybody. I will stand by
you, and when your courage threatens to fail I will
spare no pains, no sacrifice, to ease your heart. I
see the future so lowering, so gloomy,—it only lacked
that you too should yet be lost to me.
Mrs. Gabor—I shall never see him again; I shall
never see him again. He will never stand the degradation,
he will never come to terms with filth. He
will break the constraint put on him: the terrible
example is fresh before his eyes.—And if I do see
him again—O God, O God!—that happy, spring-like
heart, his ringing laugh,—everything, everything,—his
child-like resolution to battle manfully
for right and good,—oh, that unspoiled spirit like
the morning sky, as I have cherished it in him, clear
and pure, as my highest good....—Hold me to
account, if the wrong cries for reparation! Hold
me to account! Do what you will with me! I bear
[86]
the blame!—But keep your fearful hands off the
child!
Mr. Gabor—It is he who has gone wrong.
Mrs. Gabor—He has not gone wrong!
Mr. Gabor—He has gone wrong!—I would have
given anything to have spared your boundless love
this!—A woman came to me this morning distracted,
scarcely able to speak, with this letter in her hand—a
letter to her fifteen-year-old daughter.⁠[6] She had
opened it, she said, from simple curiosity; the child
was not at home.—In this letter Melchior explains to
the fifteen-year-old girl that his treatment of her
leaves him no peace, that he has sinned against her,
etc., etc., and will naturally take the responsibility
for everything. She is not to worry, even if she should
feel consequences. He is already on the way to procure
help—his expulsion will make that easier for
him. The misstep they have made may yet lead to
her happiness—and what more senseless twaddle you
please!
Mrs. Gabor—Impossible!
Mr. Gabor—The letter is forged. It’s a case of
imposture. Someone is trying to turn his notorious
expulsion to account. I have not yet spoken with
the lad—but just look at the hand! Look at the
writing!
[87]
Mrs. Gabor—An unheard-of, shameless piece of
knavery!
Mr. Gabor—[With double meaning.] I fear so.
Mrs. Gabor—No! No! Never in the world!
Mr. Gabor—All the better for us, then.—The
woman asked me, wringing her hands, what she ought
to do. I told her she ought not to let her fifteen-year-old
daughter scramble around haylofts. The
letter she fortunately left with me.—Now if we send
Melchior to another school where he won’t even be
under parental supervision, we shall have the
same thing happening in three weeks—a new expulsion—his
joyous, spring-like heart will get accustomed
to them by degrees.—Tell me, Fanny, where
am I to put the lad?
Mrs. Gabor—In the House of Correction⁠——
Mr. Gabor—In the...?
Mrs. Gabor— ... House of Correction!
Mr. Gabor—He will find there, first of all, what
was wrongfully withheld from him at home: iron discipline,
fundamental principles, and a moral restraint
to which he will have to submit under all circumstances.—And
I may add that the House of Correction
is not the abode of horror you imagine from
the name. Chief weight there is laid upon the development
of Christian thought and feeling. The
lad will there, at last, learn to aim at what’s good,
not what’s interesting, and in his actions take
account not of his natural impulses but of the law.—Half
an hour ago I received a telegram from my
brother which, I think, confirms what the woman
[88]
told me. Melchior has confided in him and asked
him for two hundred marks with which to fly to
England....
Mrs. Gabor—[Covers her face.] Merciful
Heaven!
CURTAIN
[89]
Scene IV.—The House of Correction. The setting
may be the same as for the Faculty Room, without
any pictures or furniture.
Melchior is shown in company with
Diethelm, Reinhold, Ruprecht, Helmuth,
and Gaston.
Diethelm—Here’s a twenty-pfennig piece.
Reinhold—What’s that for?
Diethelm—I’ll put it on the floor. You get in a
circle round it. Whoever hits it, gets it.
Ruprecht—Aren’t you in on this too, Melchior?
Melchior—No, thank you.
Helmuth—The Joseph!
Gaston—He can’t any more. He’s here to recover
his health.
Melchior—[To himself.] It isn’t wise for me
to stay out. Everyone keeps an eye on me. I must
join in—or my creature will go to the devil.—The
confinement makes them abuse themselves.—I may
break my neck: I’ll be glad. I may get away: I’ll
be glad too. I can only gain, either way.—Ruprecht
is getting to be my friend: he knows all about
things here. I’ll treat him to the chapters of
Judah’s daughter-in-law Tamar, of Moab, of Lot
and his daughters, of Queen Vashti and of Abishag
[90]
the Shunammite.—He’s got the sorriest face in the
lot!
Ruprecht—I’m getting it!
Helmuth—It’ll come yet!
Gaston—Day after to-morrow, maybe!
Helmuth—Now!—Look!—O God, O God!...
All—Summa—summa cum laude!!
Ruprecht—[Picking up the coin.] Many
thanks.
Helmuth—Come here with that, you!
Ruprecht—Dirty beast!
Helmuth—Jail-bird!
Ruprecht—[Strikes him in the face.] There!
[Runs away.]
Helmuth—[Running after him.] I’ll kill you!
The Rest—[Rushing after them.] Get after
him! Hustle! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Melchior—[Alone, looking at the window.]
There’s where the lightning-rod goes down. You
must wind a handkerchief round it.—When I think
of her the blood always shoots to my head. And
Moritz weighs on me like lead.—I’ll go to a newspaper
office: pay me by the hundred, I’ll sell
papers—collect news—write—local—ethical—psychophysical....
It’s no longer so easy to starve:—lunch-wagons,
soft-drink places.—The house is
sixty feet high and the stucco is crumbly.... She
hates me—she hates me because I’ve robbed her of
her freedom. No matter how I act, it remains—rape.—All
I can do is to hope, gradually, in the
course of years....—In a week it’ll be new moon.
[91]
To-morrow I’ll grease the hinges. By Saturday at
the latest I must know who has the key.—Sunday
evening at prayers, a cataleptic fit—please God no
one else gets sick!—Everything lies as clearly as if
it had happened before me. I can get over the window-sill
easily—a swing—a grip—but one must wrap
a handkerchief around it.—There comes the Head
Inquisitor. [He goes off. Dr. Prokrustes and a
Locksmith enter on the other side.]
Dr. Prokrustes— ... It’s true the windows are
in the third story and nettles are planted underneath;
but what does degeneracy care for nettles?—Last
winter one climbed out of a skylight on us,
and we had all the fuss of picking up and carting
away and burying....
The Locksmith—Do you want the grating of
wrought iron?
Dr. Prokrustes—Wrought iron—and since it
can’t be set in, riveted.
CURTAIN
[92]
Scene V.—Wendla’s room. Wendla in bed. Mrs.
Bergmann at its foot. Ina leaning at the
window. Dr. von Brausepulver discoursing.
Dr. von Brausepulver—How old are you exactly?
Wendla—Fourteen and a half.
Dr. von Brausepulver—I have been prescribing
Blaud’s pills for fifteen years, and in a great
many cases have observed the most inspiring improvement.
I prefer them to cod-liver oil or tonics
with iron. Begin with three to four pills per day,
and increase the quantity as fast as you can assimilate
it. I had prescribed for the Baroness
Elfriede von Witzleben an increase of one pill every
third day. The Baroness misunderstood me and increased
the dose three pills each day. In less than
three weeks the Baroness was able to go to Pyrmont
with her lady mother to complete the cure. Tiring
walks and extra meals we can dispense with. Instead,
promise me, my dear, that you will try to
move about all the more energetically, and not be
ashamed to ask for nourishment as soon as your
appetite reappears. Then these oppressed feelings
round the heart will soon pass off—and the headache,
the chills, the dizziness—and our terrible bilious
[93]
attacks. Baroness Elfriede von Witzleben
within a week of beginning the cure was enjoying
a whole broiled chicken with baked new potatoes for
breakfast.
Mrs. Bergmann—May I offer you a glass of
wine, Doctor?
Dr. von Brausepulver—Thank you, dear Mrs.
Bergmann, my carriage is waiting. Don’t take it
so much to heart. In a few weeks our dear little
patient will be as fresh and lively again as a gazelle,—be
sure of it!—Good day, Mrs. Bergmann. Good
day, my dear. Good day, ladies. Good day. [He
goes, accompanied by Mrs. Bergmann.]
Ina—[At the window.] Well, your plane-tree is
turning already—quite gay again. Can you see it
from your bed?—A brief display, hardly worth being
glad about, as one watches it come and go.—I must
be going soon now, too. August will be waiting for
me at the post office, and I must see the dressmaker
first. Mucki is getting his first little trousers, and
Karl is to have some new leggings for the winter.
Wendla—Often I feel so happy, Ina!—all gladness
and sunshine. I wouldn’t have dreamed that
anyone could feel so blissful round the heart. I
want to go out and walk across the meadows in the
evening glow and hunt for primroses along the river,
and sit down at the bank and dream.... And then
comes the toothache, and I think I must be
going to die first thing in the morning: I get hot and
cold, everything goes black before my eyes, and then
the uncanny thing flutters in me.—Every time I wake
[94]
up I see mother crying. Oh, that hurts me so—I
can’t tell you, Ina!
Ina—Hadn’t I better lift your pillow higher?
Mrs. Bergmann—[Coming back.] He thinks
the nausea will get better too; and then you can just
quietly get up again.... It’s my belief too that
it’ll be better if you get up again soon, Wendla.
Ina—By the next time I drop in, perhaps you’ll
be dancing round the house again.—Good-bye,
mother. I’ve just got to get to the dressmaker’s.
God keep you, Wendla dear. [Kisses her.] Get
better very, very soon.
Wendla—Good-bye, Ina.—Bring me some primroses
when you come again. Good-bye. Kiss your
youngster for me.... [Ina goes.]—What else
did he say, mother, when he was out there?
Mrs. Bergmann—He didn’t say anything. He
said the Baroness von Witzleben was also subject
to fainting-spells. It was almost always that way
with chlorosis.
Wendla—Did he say, mother, that I had
chlorosis?
Mrs. Bergmann—You’re to drink milk and eat
meat and vegetables when your appetite has come
back.
Wendla—Oh, mother, mother, I don’t believe I
have chlorosis!...
Mrs. Bergmann—You have chlorosis, child. Lie
still, Wendla, lie still. You have chlorosis.
Wendla—No, mother, no! I know I haven’t!
[95]
I feel it! I haven’t got chlorosis—I’ve got the
dropsy....
Mrs. Bergmann—You have chlorosis. Yes, he
did say you had chlorosis. Quiet down, girlie. It
will get better.
Wendla—It won’t get better. I have the dropsy.
I must die, mother.—Oh, mother, I must die!
Mrs. Bergmann—You must not die, child! You
must not die!... Merciful Heaven, you must not
die!
Wendla—But why do you cry, then, so miserably?
Mrs. Bergmann—You must not die—child!
You haven’t got dropsy. You have a baby, girl!
You have a baby!—Oh, why, why did you do that
to me?
Wendla—I didn’t do anything⁠——
Mrs. Bergmann—Oh, don’t deny it now, Wendla!—I
know, I know. See, I couldn’t have said a word
to you,—Wendla, my Wendla!...
Wendla—But that is quite impossible, mother!
I’m not married!
Mrs. Bergmann—Great God, that’s just it—that
you’re not married! That is just the frightful
thing about it!—Wendla, Wendla, Wendla, what
did you do!
Wendla—Why, really, I don’t remember any
more! We were lying in the hay.... I haven’t
loved a soul in the world but you—only you, mother.
Mrs. Bergmann—My darling⁠——
[96]
Wendla—Oh, mother, why didn’t you tell me
everything?
Mrs. Bergmann—Child, child, let’s not make each
other’s hearts still heavier. Control yourself!
Don’t despair, my child!—What, tell that to a fourteen-year-old
girl? Why, I should sooner have expected
the sun to go out! I haven’t done anything
different with you than my dear good mother did
with me.—Oh, let us trust in the good God, Wendla;
let us hope for pity, and bear our lot! See, there’s
still time: nothing has happened yet, child; and
if we just don’t get cowardly now, the good God
won’t forsake us either.—Be brave, Wendla, be
brave!—One may be sitting at the window so with
her hands in her lap, because so far everything has
turned out good,—and then something bursts in on
her and makes her heart feel like breaking on the
spot.... Wha-what are you trembling for?
Wendla—Somebody knocked.
Mrs. Bergmann—I didn’t hear anything, dear
heart. [Goes to the door and opens it.]
Wendla—Oh, I heard it very clearly.—Who is
outside?
Mrs. Bergmann—No one.—Schmidt’s mother
from Garden Street.—You come just right, Mother
Schmidtin.
CURTAIN
[97]
Scene VI.—Vintagers, men and women, are in the
Vineyard. In the west the sun is sinking behind
the mountain peaks. A clear sound of bells
comes up from the valley.—At the uppermost
vine-trellis, under the overhanging cliffs, Hansy
Rilow and Ernest Roebel sprawl in the drying
grass.
Ernest—I have overworked.
Hansy—Let’s not be sad.—Too bad how the minutes
fly.
Ernest—You see them hanging and can no more—and
to-morrow they’ll be pressed.
Hansy—Being tired is as unbearable to me as
being hungry.
Ernest—Oh, I can no more!
Hansy—Just this one shining muscatel!
Ernest—There’s a limit to my elasticity.
Hansy—If I bend the spray, it’ll swing back and
forth between our mouths. We’ll neither of us have
to stir—just bite off the grapes and let the stalk
spring back to the vine.
Ernest—One no sooner resolves on something
than lo! the strength that had vanished is renewed
in him again.
Hansy—And add the flaming firmament—and the
[98]
evening bells,—my hopes for the future rise scarcely
higher than this.
Ernest—I often see myself as a Reverend Pastor
already, with a genial, motherly housewife, a voluminous
library, and offices and honors everywhere.
Six days you have, to ruminate, and on the seventh
you open your mouth. When you go walking,
school-children take your hand, and when you come
home the coffee is steaming, the cakes are brought
in, and thru the garden door the girls come up with
apples.—Can you imagine anything happier?
Hansy—I have visions of half-shut lashes, half-opened
lips, and Turkish draperies.—I don’t believe
in pathos. You see, our elders pull long faces
to cover their stupidities from us. Among themselves
they call each other blockheads as we do. I
know that.—When I’m a millionaire, I’ll set up a
memorial to dear God.—Think of the future as a
milk pudding with sugar and spice. One fellow upsets
it and bawls. Another stirs it all up in a mess
and toils. Why not skim it?—or don’t you believe
that that art can be learned?
Ernest—Let us skim!
Hansy—What’s left ’ll be chicken-feed.—I’ve
pulled my head out of so many nooses now already....
Ernest—Let us skim, Hansy!—Why do you
laugh?
Hansy—Are you beginning again already?
Ernest—One of us has got to begin.
Hansy—When we think back thirty years hence
[99]
to an evening such as this, it may seem to us beautiful
beyond words.
Ernest—And how beautiful everything is, now,
quite of itself!
Hansy—So why not?
Ernest—If one happened to be alone, one might
even weep.
Hansy—Don’t let us be sad. [Kisses him on the
mouth.]
Ernest—[Returning the kiss.] I left the house
with the idea of just merely speaking to you and
going back again.
Hansy—I was expecting you.—Virtue isn’t a bad
clothing, but it belongs on imposing figures.
Ernest—It still hangs loose around our limbs.
I should have been uneasy if I hadn’t found you.—I
love you, Hansy, as I’ve never loved a living soul....
Hansy—Let’s not be sad.—When we think back,
thirty years hence,—why, we may laugh at ourselves!—And
now it is all so beautiful! The mountains
are glowing, the grapes droop into our mouths,
and the evening breeze whispers along the rocks like
a little playful wheedling— ...
CURTAIN
[100]
Scene VII.—The graveyard, in a clear November
night. On bush and tree rustles the withered
foliage. Jagged clouds speed by under the
moon.—Melchior clambers over the wall above
Moritz’s grave—set much farther up-stage
than in Scene II—and jumps down, knocking
over Moritz’s cross.
Melchior—The pack won’t follow me into this
place.—While they’re searching brothels, I can
catch my breath and see how far I’ve gotten....
Coat in tatters, pockets empty,—even from the
most harmless I have something to fear.—During
the day I must try to get farther on in the wood....
I have kicked down a cross.—The little flowers
would have been frozen to-night!—All around the
earth is bare....
In the realm of the dead!
To climb out of the skylight was not so hard as
the road before me.—This was the only thing that
I was not prepared for....
I hang above the abyss—everything swallowed up
and gone!—Oh, that I had stayed back there!
Why she thru my fault?—Why not the guilty one!—Inscrutable
Providence!—I would have broken
stones and gone hungry...!
What is left now to keep me straight?—Crime
[101]
will follow on crime. I am abandoned to the mire.
Not even the strength left to wind things up....
I was not bad!—I was not bad!—I was not
bad!...
Never has mortal wandered over graves so filled
with envy!—Pah! I should never screw up the courage!—Oh,
if insanity would but seize on me—this
very night!
I must look over there among the latest ones.—The
wind whistles past every stone with a different
note—a heart-chilling symphony! The rotten
wreaths blow apart and dangle on their long strings
piecemeal round the marble crosses—a forest of
scarecrows!—Scarecrows on all the graves, each
more horrible than the next, house-high, putting the
devils to flight.—The golden letters glitter so
coldly.... The weeping willow moans, and gropes
with gigantic fingers over the inscriptions!...
A praying cherub—a bare slab⁠——
Now a cloud casts its shadow down here.—How
fast it flies, crying!—like a host pursued it rushes
up in the east.—Not a star in the sky!⁠——
Evergreen round the plot?—Evergreen?—a
girl?...
[102]
And I am her murderer!—I am her murderer!—Despair
is left me—only despair!—I may not cry
here. I must get away—away! [Moritz Stiefel,
with his head under his arm, comes stumping
over the graves.]
Moritz—One moment, Melchior. It may be long
before the chance recurs. You’ve no idea how
everything depends on the time and place....
Melchior—Where did you come from?
Moritz—From over there—from the wall. You
knocked down my cross. I lie by the wall.—Give
me your hand, Melchior....
Melchior—You are not Moritz Stiefel!
Moritz—Give me your hand. I’m certain sure
you’ll thank me. It’ll never be so easy for you
again. This is a rarely fortunate meeting.—I came
up especially⁠——
Melchior—Don’t you sleep?
Moritz—Not what you call sleeping.—We sit on
church steeples, on lofty gables,—wherever we
want....
Melchior—Ever restless?
Moritz—For fun.—We scoot around young
birch-trees, round lonely forest shrines. Over gatherings
of people we hover, over sites of misfortune,
over gardens and festival places. In the dwelling-houses
we crouch in the chimney-corner and behind
the bed-curtains.—Give me your hand!—We have
little to do with each other but we see and hear
everything that happens in the world. We know
[103]
that everything is folly that men strive for and
achieve,—and laugh at it.
Melchior—What good does that do?
Moritz—What’s it need to do?—We are out of
reach—nor good nor evil can touch us any more.
We stand high, high above the earth-folk, each for
himself alone. We have nothing to do with each
other because that bores us. None of us still has
anything at heart whose loss he could feel. We are
equally immeasurably far above both grief and rejoicing.
We are content with ourselves, and that
is all!—The living we despise beyond words: we can
hardly pity them. They amuse us with their doings,
because, being alive, they are not really to be pitied.
We smile, each to himself, over their tragedies, and
meditate.—Give me your hand! If you will give me
your hand, you will fall over with laughing at the
emotion with which you give me your hand....
Melchior—Doesn’t that disgust you?
Moritz—We stand too high above it for that.
We smile!—At my funeral I was among the mourners.
I got a lot of entertainment from it. That is
sublimity, Melchior! I made more noise than any
of them, and slipped off to the wall to hold my sides
for laughter. Our unapproachable sublimity is in
fact the only standpoint that lets us assimilate the
dirt.... I suppose I was laughed at too before I
soared aloft!
Melchior—I have no desire to laugh at myself.
Moritz— ... The living as such are truly not
to be pitied.—I admit I should never have thought
[104]
so either. And now it’s beyond my comprehension
how one can be so naïve. Now I see thru the fraud
so clearly that not the tiniest cloud is left.—How can
you hesitate, Melchior? Give me your hand. In a
turn of the head you’ll be standing sky-high above
yourself.—Your living is a grievous omission, a sin
of negligence....
Melchior—Can you dead forget?
Moritz—We can do everything. Give me your
hand! We can be sorry for the young, for the way
they take their timidity for idealism, and the old,
whose stoical superiority comes near to breaking
their hearts. We see the Kaiser shake for dread of
a street-song, and the beggar for dread of the trump
of doom. We look straight thru the actor’s make-up,
and see the poet in the dark don his. We behold
the contented man in his beggary, and in the weariness
of his burdened soul the capitalist. We observe
people in love, and see them blush before each
other in the presentiment that they are frauds defrauded.
Parents we see bringing children into the
world in order that they may call to them “How fortunate
you are to have such parents!”—and we
see the children go forth and do the like. We can
eavesdrop on the innocent in their lonely cravings,
and the five-groschen drab at her reading of
Schiller.... God and the devil we see making fools
of themselves before each other, and cherish in our
hearts the unshakable conviction that both are
drunk.... A quiet—a content—Melchior!—You
need only reach me your little finger.—You may get
[105]
to be snow-white before such a favorable moment
appears to you again.
Melchior—If I shake hands on it, Moritz, it will
be from self-contempt. I see myself proscribed.
What lent me courage, lies in the grave. I can no
longer think myself worthy of noble impulses—and
perceive nothing, nothing, that might yet stand in
the way of my descent.—I am, in my own opinion,
the most detestable creature in the universe....
Moritz—What are you waiting for? [A Muffled
Gentleman enters, and addresses Melchior.]
The Muffled Gentleman—The fact is, you’re
shivering with hunger. You’re in no sort of condition
to decide.—[To Moritz.] Go.
Melchior—Who are you?
The Muffled Gentleman—That will come out.—[To
Moritz.] Vanish!—What have you here to
do?—Why haven’t you got your head on?
Moritz—I shot myself.
The Muffled Gentleman—Then stay where you
belong! You’re altogether done with. Don’t bother
us here with your charnel stench. Inconceivable—why,
just look at your fingers! Pah, what the
devil! they’re crumbling down already!
Moritz—Don’t send me away, please!...
Melchior—Who are you, good sir?
Moritz—Don’t send me away, I beg you! Let
me take part in things here a little while yet. I will
not oppose you in anything.—It’s so chilly down
there!
The Muffled Gentleman—Then why do you
[106]
brag about sublimity?—You know well enough
that that’s humbug—sour grapes! Why do you
wilfully lie, you coinage of the brain?—If you value
the favor so highly, stay for all of me; but look out
for any more hot-air boasting, my friend, and kindly
keep your rotting hand out of the game!
Melchior—Are you going to tell me who you are,
or not?
The Muffled Gentleman—No.—I propose that
you entrust yourself to me. First, I should see to
your getting away.
Melchior—You are—my father?!
The Muffled Gentleman—Would you not recognize
your worthy father by his voice?
Melchior—No.
The Muffled Gentleman—The gentleman, your
father, is seeking comfort at this moment in the
capable arms of your mother.—I open the world to
you. Your momentary want of balance springs from
your wretched situation. With a hot supper in your
belly, you can laugh at it.
Melchior—[To himself.] They can’t both be
the devil!—[Aloud.] After what I have been guilty
of, no hot supper can give my peace of mind back
to me!
The Muffled Gentleman—That depends on
the supper!—So much I can tell you: that the little
girl would have borne her child first rate! She was
perfectly built. She simply succumbed to Mother
Schmidtin’s abortives.—I will take you among men.
I will give you an opportunity to expand your horizon
[107]
beyond your wildest dreams. I will make you
acquainted with everything interesting, without exception,
that the world has to offer.
Melchior—Who are you? Who are you?—I
can’t consign myself to a person I don’t know!
The Muffled Gentleman—You’ll never learn
to know me unless you entrust yourself to me.
Melchior—Do you think so?
The Muffled Gentleman—Fact!—And anyway
you have no choice.
Melchior—I can at any moment give my friend
here my hand.
The Muffled Gentleman—Your friend is a
charlatan. Nobody smiles, who has one penny left
in his pocket. The sublimated humorist is the
wretchedest, most pitiable creature in creation!
Melchior—Let the humorist be what he will.
Tell me who you are, or I’ll give the humorist my
hand!
The Muffled Gentleman—Well?!
Moritz—He is right, Melchior. I have been putting
on airs. Let him treat you, and make full use
of him. No matter how muffled he may be, he is, at
least, that!
Melchior—Do you believe in God?
The Muffled Gentleman—That depends.
Melchior—Do you want to tell me who discovered
gunpowder?
The Muffled Gentleman—Berthold Schwarz—alias
Constantine Anklitzen—round 1330, a Franciscan
monk at Freiburg-im-Breisgau.
[108]
Moritz—What would I give to have had him let
it alone!
The Muffled Gentleman—You would merely
have hanged yourself!
Melchior—What do you think about morality?
The Muffled Gentleman—Look here!—am I
your schoolboy?
Melchior—Ask me what you are!
Moritz—Don’t quarrel!—Please don’t quarrel!
What good will come of that?—What are we sitting,
one dead and two live men, here together in the
churchyard at two in the morning for, if we want
to fall out like tipplers!—It was for my pleasure
that I was allowed to remain and witness the proceedings.
If you want to quarrel, I’ll take my head
under my arm and go.
Melchior—You’re still the same old runaway!
The Muffled Gentleman—The ghost isn’t so
wrong. One shouldn’t ignore one’s dignity.—By
morality I understand the real product of two
imaginary quantities. The imaginary quantities are
should and would.⁠[7] The product is called morality,
and its reality is unquestionable.
Moritz—Oh, if you had only told me that sooner!
My morality harried me to death. For my dear
parents’ sake I clutched at deadly weapons. “Honor
thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be
long upon the land.” In my case the text has phenomenally
stultified itself!
[109]
The Muffled Gentleman—Indulge in no illusions,
my dear friend. Your precious parents would
no more have died of it than you. Strictly speaking,
they would in fact have stormed and blustered merely
from the necessities of health.
Melchior—You may be right so far:—but I can
tell you positively, good sir, that if I had given
Moritz my hand just now without more ado, the
blame would have rested simply and solely on my
morality.
The Muffled Gentleman—But that’s just the
reason you’re not Moritz!
Moritz—All the same I don’t believe the difference
is so material—at least, not so conclusive, that
you might not perchance have met me too, esteemed
Unknown, as I trotted that time through the alder-thickets
with the pistol in my pocket.
The Muffled Gentleman—And don’t you remember
me? Why, even at the final moment, you
still were standing between Death and Life.—But
here, in my opinion, is not exactly the place
to prolong so deeply probing a debate.
Moritz—It is indeed growing cold, gentlemen!—Though
they did dress me in my Sunday suit,
I have on under it neither shirt nor drawers.
Melchior—Good-bye, dear Moritz. Where this
person is taking me, I don’t know; but he is somebody⁠——
Moritz—Don’t lay it up against me, Melchior,
that I tried to make away with you! It was old
attachment.—I’d be willing to have to wail and weep
[110]
all my life if I could now accompany you out of
here once more!
The Muffled Gentleman—In the end, each has
his share—you the consoling consciousness of having
nothing—thou the enervating doubt of everything.—[To
Moritz.] Farewell.
Melchior—Farewell, Moritz! Accept my cordial
thanks for appearing to me once more. How
many glad, untroubled days have we not spent with
one another in these fourteen years! I promise you,
Moritz, let chance what will,—tho in the years
to come I turn ten times a different man,—be my
path upwards or downwards,—you I shall never
forget⁠——
Moritz—Thanks, thanks, dear friend.
Melchior—And when some day I am an old man,
grizzle-haired, then perhaps it will be you that
once again stand closer to me than all those living
with me.
Moritz—I thank you.—Luck to your journey,
gentlemen.—Lose no more time!
The Muffled Gentleman—Come, child! [He
links arms with Melchior, and makes off with him
over the graves.]
Moritz—Here I sit now with my head in my
arm.—The moon hides her face, unveils again, and
looks not a hair the wiser.—So now I’ll turn back to
my little plot, straighten the cross up that the madcap
kicked so recklessly down on me, and when all
is in order I’ll lay myself out on my back again,
warm myself with decay, and smile....

[At rise is seen the entrance to a tent, out of
which steps an animal-tamer, with long, black curls,
dressed in a white cravat, a vermilion dress-coat,
white trousers and white top-boots. He carries in his
left hand a dog-whip and in his right a loaded revolver,
and enters to the sound of cymbals and kettledrums.]
Walk in! Walk in to the menagerie,
  Proud gentlemen and ladies lively and merry.
  With avid lust or cold disgust, the very
  Beast without Soul bound and made secondary
  To human genius, to stay and see!
  Walk in, the show’ll begin!—As customary,
  One child to each two persons comes in free.

  Here battle man and brute in narrow cages,
  Where one in mockery his long whip lashes,
  The other, growling as when thunder rages,
  Against the man’s throat murderously dashes,—
  Where now the crafty, now the strong prevails,
  Now man, now beast, against the flooring quails.
  The animal rears,—the human on all fours!
  One ice-cold look of dominance—The
[116]
  beast submissive bows before that glance,
  And the proud heel upon his neck adores.

  Bad are the times! Ladies and gentlemen
  Who once before my cage in thronging crescents
  Crowded, now honor operas, and then
  Ibsen, with their so highly valued presence.
  My boarders here are so in want of fodder
  That they reciprocally devour each other.
  How well off at the theater is a player,
  Sure of the meat upon his ribs, no matter
  How terrible the hunger round his platter,
  And colleagues’ inner cupboards yawning bare!—
  But if to heights of art we would aspire,
  We may not reckon merit by its hire.

  What see you, whether in light or sombre plays?
House-animals, whose morals all must praise,
  Who vent pale spites in vegetarian ways,
  And revel in a singsong to-and-fro
  Just like those others—in the seats below.
  This hero has a head by one dram swirled;
  That, is in doubt whether his love be right;
  A third you hear despairing of the world,—
  Full five acts long you hear him wail his plight,
  And no man ends him with a merciful sleight!
  But the real beast, the beautiful, wild beast,
  Your eyes on that, I, ladies, only, feast!

  You see the Tiger, that habitually
  Devours whatever falls before his bound;
[117]  The Bear, who, gluttonous from the first sally,
  Sinks at his late night-meal dead to the ground;
  You see the Monkey, little and amusing,
  From sheer ennui his petty powers abusing,—
  He has some talent, of all greatness scant,
  So, impudently, coquettes with his own want!
  Upon my soul, within my tent and trammel—
  See, right behind the curtain, here—’s a Camel!
  And all my creatures fawn about my feet
  When my revolver cracks—
[He shoots into the audience.]
Behold!
  Brutes tremble all around me. I am cold:
  The man stays cold,—you, with respect, to greet.

  Walk in!—You hardly trust yourselves in here?—
  Then very well, judge for yourselves! Each sphere
  Has sent its crawling creatures to your telling:
  Chameleons and serpents, crocodiles,
  Dragons, and salamanders chasm-dwelling,—
  I know, of course, you’re full of quiet smiles
  And don’t believe a syllable I say.—
[He lifts the entrance-flap and calls into the
tent.]
Hi, Charlie!—bring our Serpent just this way!
[A stage-hand with a big paunch carries out
the actress of Lulu in her Pierrot costume,
and sets her down before the animal-tamer.]
[118]
She was created to incite to sin,
  To lure, seduce, corrupt, drop poison in,—
  To murder, without being once suspected.
[Tickling Lulu’s chin.]
My pretty beast, only be unaffected,
  Not vain, not artificial, not perverse,
  Even if the critics therefore turn adverse.
  Thou hast no right to spoil the shape most fitting,
  Most true, of woman, with meows and spitting!
  Nor with buffoonery and wry device
  To foul the childish simpleness of Vice
  Thou shouldst—to-day I speak emphatically—
  Speak naturally and not unnaturally,
  For the first principle, of earliest force
  In every art, has been Be matter-of-course!
[To the public.]
There’s nothing special now to see in her,
  But wait and watch what later will occur!
  She coils about the Tiger stricter—stricter—
  He roars and groans!—Who’ll be the final victor?—
  Hop, Charlie, march! Carry her to her cage,
[The stage-hand picks up Lulu slantwise in
his arms; the animal-tamer pats her on the
hips.]
Sweet innocence—my dearest appanage!
[The stage-hand carries Lulu back into the
tent.]
And now the best thing yet remains to say:
  My poll between the teeth of a beast of prey!
[119]
  Walk in! The show’s not new, yet every heart
  Takes pleasure in it still! I’ll wrench apart
  This wild beast’s jaws—I dare—and he’ll not dare
  To close and bite! Let him be ne’er so fair,
  So wild and brightly flecked, he feels respect
  For my poor poll! I offer it him direct:
  One joke, and my two temples crack!—but, lo,
  The lightning of my eyes I will forego,
  Staking my life against a joke! and throw
  My whip, my weapons, down. I am in my skin!
  I yield me to this beast!—His name do ye know?
  —The honored public! that has just walked in!
[The animal-tamer steps back into the tent,
accompanied by cymbals and kettledrums.]
[120]
Scene—A roomy studio. Entrance door at the rear,
left. Another door at lower left to the bedroom.
At centre, a platform for the model, with a
Spanish screen behind it, shielding it from the
rear door, and a Smyrna rug in front. Two
easels at lower right. On the upper one is the
picture of a young girl’s head and shoulders.
Against the other leans a reversed canvas. Below
these, toward centre, an ottoman, with a
tiger-skin on it. Two chairs along the left wall.
In the background, right, a step-ladder.
Schön sits on the foot of the ottoman, inspecting
critically the picture on the further
easel. Schwarz stands behind the ottoman, his
palette and brushes in his hands.
Schön—Do you know, I’m getting acquainted
with a brand-new side of the lady.
Schwarz—I have never painted anyone whose expression
changed so continuously. I could hardly
keep a single feature the same two days running.
Schön—[Pointing to the picture and observing
him.] Do you find that in it?
Schwarz—I have done everything I could think of
to induce at least some repose in her mood by my
conversation during the sittings.
Schön—Then I understand the difference.
[121][Schwarz dips his brush in the oil and draws it over
the features of the face.] Do you think that makes
it look more like her?
Schwarz—We can do no more than take our art
as scientifically as possible.
Schön—Tell me⁠——
Schwarz—[Stepping back.] The color had sunk
in pretty well, too.
Schön—[Looking at him.] Have you ever in
your life loved a woman?
Schwarz—[Goes to the easel, puts a color on it,
and steps back on the other side.] The dress hasn’t
been given relief enough yet. We don’t rightly perceive
yet that a living body is under it.
Schön—I make no doubt that the workmanship is
good.
Schwarz—If you’ll step this way....
Schön—[Rising.] You must have told her regular
ghost-stories.
Schwarz—As far back as you can.
Schön—[Stepping back, knocks down the canvas
that was leaning against the lower easel.] Excuse
me⁠——
Schwarz—[Picking it up.] That’s all right.
Schön—[Surprised.] What is that?
Schwarz—Do you know her?
Schön—No. [Schwarz sets the picture on the
easel. It is of a lady dressed as Pierrot with a long
shepherd’s crook in her hand.]
Schwarz—A costume-picture.
Schön—But, really, you’ve succeeded with her.
[122]
Schwarz—You know her?
Schön—No. And in that costume⁠——
Schwarz—It isn’t nearly finished yet. [Schön
nods.] What would you have? While she is posing
for me I have the pleasure of entertaining her husband.
Schön—What?
Schwarz—We talk about art, of course,—to complete
my good fortune!
Schön—But how did you come to make such a
charming acquaintance?
Schwarz—As they’re generally made. An ancient,
tottering little man drops in on me here to
know if I can paint his wife. Why, of course, were
she as wrinkled as Mother Earth! Next day at ten
prompt the doors fly open, and the fat-belly drives
this little beauty in before him. I can feel even now
how my knees shook. Then comes a sap-green lackey,
stiff as a ramrod, with a package under his arm.
Where is the dressing-room? Imagine my plight. I
open the door there. [Pointing left.] Just luck
that everything was in order. The sweet thing vanishes
into it, and the old fellow posts himself outside
as a bastion. Two minutes later out she steps in
this Pierrot. [Shaking his head.] I never saw anything
like it. [He goes left and stares in at the bedroom.]
Schön—[Who has followed him with his eyes.]
And the fat-belly stands guard?
Schwarz—[Turning round.] The whole body in
harmony with that impossible costume as if it had
[123]
come into the world in it! Her way of burying her
elbows in her pockets, of lifting her little feet from
the rug,—the blood often shoots to my head....
Schön—One can see that in the picture.
Schwarz—[Shaking his head.] People like us,
you know⁠——
Schön—Here the model is mistress of the conversation.
Schwarz—She has never yet opened her mouth.
Schön—Is it possible?
Schwarz—Allow me to show you the costume.
[Goes out left.]
Schön—[Before the Pierrot.] A devilish beauty.
[Before the other picture.] There’s more depth here.
[Coming down-stage.] He is still rather young for
his age. [Schwarz comes back with a white satin
costume.]
Schwarz—What sort of material is that?
Schön—[Feeling it.] Satin.
Schwarz—And all in one piece.
Schön—How does one get into it then?
Schwarz—That I can’t tell you.
Schön—[Taking the costume by the legs.] What
enormous trouser-legs!
Schwarz—The left one she pulls up.
Schön—[Looking at the picture.] Above the
knee!
Schwarz—She does that entrancingly!
Schön—And transparent stockings?
Schwarz—Those have got to be painted, specially.
Schön—Oh, you can do that.
[124]
Schwarz—And with it all a coquetry!
Schön—What brought you to that horrible suspicion?
Schwarz—There are things never dreamt of in
our school-philosophy. [He takes the costume back
into his bedroom.]
Schön—[Alone.] When one is asleep....
Schwarz—[Comes back; looks at his watch.] If
you’d like to make her acquaintance, moreover,⁠——
Schön—No.
Schwarz—They must be here in a moment.
Schön—How much longer will the lady have to
sit?
Schwarz—I shall probably have to bear the pains
of Tantalus three months longer.
Schön—I mean the other one.
Schwarz—I beg your pardon. Three times more
at most. [Going to the door with him.] If the lady
will just leave me the upper part of the dress
then....
Schön—With pleasure. Let us see you at my
house again soon. [He collides in the doorway with
Dr. Goll and Lulu.] For Heaven’s sake!
Schwarz—May I introduce....
Dr. Goll—[To Schön.] What are you doing
here?
Schön—[Kissing Lulu’s hand.] Mrs. Goll....
Lulu—You’re not going already?
Dr. Goll—But what wind blows you here?
Schön—I’ve been looking at the picture of my
intended⁠——
[125]
Lulu—[Coming forward.] Your—intended—is
here?
Dr. Goll—So you’re having work done here, too?
Lulu—[Before the upper picture.] Look at it!
Enchanting! Entrancing!
Dr. Goll—[Looking round him.] Have you got
her hidden somewhere round here?
Lulu—So that is the sweet young prodigy who’s
made a new person out of you....
Schön—She sits in the afternoon mostly.
Dr. Goll—And you don’t tell anyone about it?
Lulu—[Turning round.] Is she really so solemn?
Schön—Probably the after-effects of the seminary
still, dear lady.
Dr. Goll—[Before the picture.] One can see
that you have been transformed profoundly.
Lulu—But now you mustn’t let her wait any
longer.
Schön—In a fortnight I think our engagement
will come out.
Dr. Goll—[To Lulu.] Let’s lose no time.
Hop!
Lulu—[To Schön.] Just think, we came at a
trot over the new bridge. I was driving, myself.
Dr. Goll—[As Schön prepares to leave.] No,
no. We two have more to talk about. Get along,
Nellie. Hop!
Lulu—Now it’s going to be about me!
Dr. Goll—Our Apelles is already wiping his
brushes.
[126]
Lulu—I had imagined this would be much more
amusing.
Schön—But you have always the satisfaction of
preparing for us the greatest and rarest pleasure.
Lulu—[Going left.] Oh, just wait!
Schwarz—[Before the bedroom door.] If madame
will be so kind.... [Shuts the door after her
and stands in front of it.]
Dr. Goll—I christened her Nellie, you know, in
our marriage-contract.
Schön—Did you?—Yes.
Dr. Goll—What do you think of it?
Schön—Why not call her rather Mignon?
Dr. Goll—That would have been good, too.
I didn’t think of that.
Schön—Do you consider the name so important?
Dr. Goll—Hm.... You know, I have no children.
Schön—But you’ve only been married a couple
of months.
Dr. Goll—Thanks, I don’t want any.
Schön—[Having taken out his cigarette-case.]
Have a cigarette?
Dr. Goll—[Helps himself.] I’ve plenty to do
with this one. [To Schwarz.] Say, what’s your
little danseuse doing now?
Schön—[Turning round on Schwarz.] You and
a danseuse?
Schwarz—The lady was sitting for me at that
time only as a favor. I made her acquaintance on
a flying trip of the Cecilia Society.
[127]
Dr. Goll—[To Schön.] Hm.... I think
we’re getting a change of weather.
Schön—The toilet isn’t going so quickly, is it?
Dr. Goll—It’s going like lightning! Woman has
got to be a virtuoso in her job. So must we all, each
in his job, if life isn’t to turn to beggary. [Calls.]
Hop, Nellie!
Lulu—[Inside.] Just a second!
Dr. Goll—[To Schön.] I can’t get onto these
blockheads. [Referring to Schwarz.]
Schön—I can’t help envying them. These blockheads
know of nothing holier than an altar-cloth, and
feel richer than you and me with 30,000-mark incomes.
Besides, you’re no person to judge a man
who has lived since childhood from palette to mouth.
Take it upon yourself to finance him: it’s an arithmetic
example! I haven’t the moral courage, and
one can easily burn one’s fingers, too.
Lulu—[As Pierrot, steps out of the bedroom.]
Here I am!
Schön—[Turns; after a pause.] Superb!
Lulu—[Nearer.] Well?
Schön—You shame the boldest fancy.
Lulu—How do you like me?
Schön—A picture before which art must despair.
Dr. Goll—Ah, you think so, too?
Schön—[To Lulu.] Have you any notion what
you’re doing?
Lulu—I’m perfectly aware of myself!
Schön—Then you might be a little more discreet.
Lulu—But I’m only doing what’s my duty.
[128]
Schön—You are powdered?
Lulu—What do you take me for!
Dr. Goll—I’ve never seen such a white skin as
she’s got. I’ve told our Raphael here, too, to do
just as little with the flesh tints as possible. I can’t
get up any enthusiasm for this modern daubing.
Schwarz—[By the easels, preparing his paints.]
At any rate, it’s thanks to impressionism that present-day
art can stand up beside the old masters
without blushing.
Dr. Goll—Oh, it may be quite the thing for a
brute being led to slaughter.
Schön—For Heaven’s sake don’t get excited!
[Lulu falls on Goll’s neck and kisses him.]
Dr. Goll—They can see your undershirt. You
must pull it lower.
Lulu—I would soonest have left it off. It only
bothers me.
Dr. Goll—He should be able to paint it out.
Lulu—[Taking the shepherd’s crook that leans
against the Spanish screen, and mounting the platform,
to Schön.] What would you say now, if you
had to stand at attention for two hours?
Schön—I’d sell my soul to the devil for the chance
to exchange with you.
Dr. Goll—[Sitting, left.] Come over here.
Here is my post of observation.
Lulu—[Plucking her left trouser-leg up to the
knee, to Schwarz.] So?
Schwarz—Yes....
Lulu—[Plucking it a thought higher.] So?
[129]
Schwarz—Yes, yes....
Dr. Goll—[To Schön, who has seated himself
on the chair next him, with a gesture.] I find that
she shows up even better from here.
Lulu—[Without stirring.] I beg pardon! I
show up equally well from every side.
Schwarz—[To Lulu.] The right knee further
forward, please.
Schön—[With a gesture.] The body does show
finer lines perhaps.
Schwarz—The lighting is at least half-way bearable
to-day.
Dr. Goll—Oh, you must throw on lots of it!
Hold your brush a bit longer.
Schwarz—Certainly, Dr. Goll.
Dr. Goll—Treat her as a piece of still-life.
Schwarz—Certainly, Doctor. [To Lulu.]
You used to hold your head a wee mite higher, Mrs.
Goll.
Lulu—[Raising her head.] Paint my lips a little
open.
Schön—Paint snow on ice. If you get warm
doing that, then instantly your art gets inartistic!
Schwarz—Certainly, Doctor.
Dr. Goll—Art, you know, must so reproduce nature
that one can get at least some spiritual
enjoyment from it!
Lulu—[Opening her mouth a little, to Schwarz.]
So—look. I’ll hold it half opened, so.
Schwarz—Every time the sun comes out, the wall
opposite throws warm reflections in here.
[130]
Dr. Goll—[To Lulu.] You must keep your
pose and behave as if our Velasquez here were nonexistent.
Lulu—Well, a painter isn’t a man, anyway.
Schön—I don’t think you ought to judge the
whole craft from nothing more than one notable exception.
Schwarz—[Stepping back from the easel.] However,
I rather wish I had had to hire a different studio
last fall.
Schön—[To Goll.] What I wanted to ask you—have
you seen the little Murphy girl yet as a
Peruvian pearl-fisher?
Dr. Goll—I see her to-morrow for the fourth
time. Prince Polossov took me. His hair has already
got dark yellow again with delight.
Schön—So you find her quite fabulous, too.
Dr. Goll—Who ever wants to judge of that beforehand?
Lulu—I think someone knocked.
Schwarz—Pardon me a moment. [Goes and
opens the door.]
Dr. Goll—[To Lulu.] You can safely smile at
him less bashfully!
Schön—To him it means nothing at all.
Dr. Goll—And if it did!—What are we two sitting
here for?
Alva Schön—[Entering, still behind the Spanish
screen.] May one come in?
Schön—My son!
Lulu—Oh! It’s Mr. Alva!
[131]
Dr. Goll—Don’t mind. Just come along in.
Alva—[Stepping forward, shakes hands with
Schön and Goll.] Glad to see you. [Turning
toward Lulu.] Do I see aright? Oh, if only I
could engage you for my title part!
Lulu—I don’t think I could dance nearly well
enough for your show!
Alva—Ah, but you have a dancing-master whose
like cannot be found on any stage in Europe.
Schön—But what brings you here?
Dr. Goll—Maybe you’re having somebody or
other painted here, too, in secret!
Alva—[To Schön.] I wanted to take you to
the dress rehearsal.
Dr. Goll—[As Schön rises.] Oho, do you have
’em dance to-day in full costume already?
Alva—Of course. Come along, too. In five minutes
I must be on the stage. [To Lulu.] Poor me!
Dr. Goll—I’ve forgotten—what’s the name of
your ballet?
Alva—Dalailama.
Dr. Goll—I thought he was in a madhouse.
Schön—You’re thinking of Nietzsche, Doctor.
Dr. Goll—You’re right; I got ’em mixed up.
Alva—I have helped Buddhism to its legs.
Dr. Goll—By his legs is the stage-poet known.
Alva—Corticelli dances the youthful Buddha as
tho she had seen the light of the world by the Ganges.
Schön—So long as her mother lived, she danced
with her legs.
[132]
Alva—Then when she got free she danced with
her intelligence.
Dr. Goll—Now she dances with her heart.
Alva—If you’d like to see her⁠——
Dr. Goll—Thank you.
Alva—Come along with us!
Dr. Goll—Impossible.
Schön—Anyway, we have no time to lose.
Alva—Come with us, Doctor. In the third act
you see Dalailama in his cloister, with his monks⁠——
Dr. Goll—The only thing I care about is the
young Buddha.
Alva—Well, what’s hindering you?
Dr. Goll—I can’t. I can’t do it.
Alva—We’re going to Peter’s, after it. There
you can express your admiration.
Dr. Goll—Don’t press me any further, please.
Alva—You’ll see the tame monkey, the two Brahmans,
the little girls....
Dr. Goll—For heaven’s sake, keep away from
me with your little girls!
Lulu—Reserve us a proscenium box for Monday,
Mr. Alva.
Alva—How could you doubt that I would, dear
lady!
Dr. Goll—When I come back this Hellebreugel
will have messed up the whole picture on me.
Alva—Well, it could be painted over.
Dr. Goll—If I don’t explain to this Caravacci
every stroke of his brush⁠——
Schön—Your fears are unfounded, I think....
[133]
Dr. Goll—Next time, gentlemen!
Alva—The Brahmans are getting impatient. The
daughters of Nirvana are shivering in their tights.
Dr. Goll—Damned splotchiness!
Schön—We’ll get jumped on if we don’t bring
you with us.
Dr. Goll—In five minutes I’ll be back. [Stands
down right, behind Schwarz and compares the picture
with Lulu.]
Alva—[To Lulu, regretfully.] Duty calls me,
gracious lady!
Dr. Goll—[To Schwarz.] You must model it
a bit more here. The hair is bad. You aren’t paying
enough attention to your business!
Alva—Come on.
Dr. Goll—Now, just hop it! Ten horses will
not drag me to Peter’s.
Schön—[Following Alva and Goll.] We’ll
take my carriage. It’s waiting downstairs. [Exeunt.]
Schwarz—[Leans over to the right, and spits.]
Pack!—If only life could end!—The bread-basket!—paunch
and mug!—my artist’s pride has got its
back up. [After a look at Lulu.] This company!—[Gets
up, goes up left, observes Lulu from all
sides, and sits again at his easel.] The choice would
be a hard one to make. If I may request Mrs. Goll
to raise the right hand a little higher.
Lulu—[Grasps the crook as high as she can
reach; to herself.] Who would have thought that
was possible!
[134]
Schwarz—I am quite ridiculous, you think?
Lulu—He’s coming right back.
Schwarz—I can do no more than paint.
Lulu—There he is!
Schwarz—[Rising.] Well?
Lulu—Don’t you hear?
Schwarz—Someone is coming....
Lulu—I knew it.
Schwarz—It’s the janitor. He’s sweeping the
stairs.
Lulu—Thank Heaven!
Schwarz—Do you perhaps accompany the doctor
to his patients?
Lulu—Everything but that.
Schwarz—Because, you are not accustomed to
being alone.
Lulu—We have a housekeeper at home.
Schwarz—She keeps you company?
Lulu—She has a lot of taste.
Schwarz—What for?
Lulu—She dresses me.
Schwarz—Do you go much to balls?
Lulu—Never.
Schwarz—Then what do you need the dresses
for?
Lulu—For dancing.
Schwarz—You really dance?
Lulu—Czardas ... Samaqueca ... Skirt-dance.
Schwarz—Doesn’t—that—disgust you?
Lulu—You find me ugly?
[135]
Schwarz—You don’t understand me. But who
gives you lessons then?
Lulu—Him.
Schwarz—Who?
Lulu—Him.
Schwarz—He?
Lulu—He plays the violin⁠——
Schwarz—Every day one learns something new.
Lulu—I learned in Paris. I took lessons from
Eugénie Fougère. She let me copy her costumes,
too.
Schwarz—What are they like?
Lulu—A little green lace skirt to the knee, all in
ruffles, low-necked, of course, very low-necked and
awfully tight-laced. Bright green petticoat, then
brighter and brighter. Snow-white underclothes
with a hand’s-breadth of lace....
Schwarz—I can no longer⁠——
Lulu—Then paint!
Schwarz—[Scraping the canvas.] Aren’t you
cold at all?
Lulu—God forbid! No. What made you ask?
Are you so cold?
Schwarz—Not to-day. No.
Lulu—Praise God, one can breathe!
Schwarz—How so?... [Lulu takes a deep
breath.] Don’t do that, please! [Springs up,
throws away his palette and brushes, walks up and
down.] The bootblack has only her feet to attend
to, at least! And his color doesn’t eat into his
[136]
money, either. If I go without supper to-morrow,
no little society lady will be asking me if I know
anything about oyster-patties!
Lulu—Is he going out of his head?
Schwarz—[Takes up his work again.] What
ever drove the fellow to this test?
Lulu—I’d like it better, too, if he had stayed
here.
Schwarz—We are truly the martyrs of our calling!
Lulu—I didn’t wish to cause you pain.
Schwarz—[Hesitating, to Lulu.] If you—the
left trouser-leg—a little higher⁠——
Lulu—Here?
Schwarz—[Steps to the platform.] Permit
me....
Lulu—What do you want?
Schwarz—I’ll show you.
Lulu—You mustn’t.
Schwarz—You are nervous.... [Tries to seize
her hand.]
Lulu—[Throws the crook in his face.] Let me
alone! [Hurries to the entrance door.] You’re a
long way yet from getting me.
Schwarz—You can’t understand a joke.
Lulu—Oh, yes, I can. I understand everything.
Just you leave me be. You’ll get nothing at all from
me by force. Go to your work. You have no right
to molest me. [Flees behind the ottoman.] Sit
down behind your easel!
[137]
Schwarz—[Trying to get around the ottoman.]
As soon as I’ve punished you—you wayward, capricious⁠——
Lulu—But you must have me, first! Go away.
You can’t catch me. In long clothes I’d have fallen
into your clutches long ago—but in the Pierrot!
Schwarz—[Throwing himself across the ottoman.]
I’ve got you!
Lulu—[Hurls the tiger-skin over his head.]
Good night! [Jumps over the platform and climbs
up the step-ladder.] I can see away over all the
cities of the earth.
Schwarz—[Unrolling himself from the rug.]
This old skin!
Lulu—I reach up into heaven, and stick the stars
in my hair.
Schwarz—[Clambering after her.] I’ll shake it
till you fall off!
Lulu—If you don’t stop, I’ll throw the ladder
down. [Climbing higher.] Will you let go of my
legs? God save the Poles! [Makes the ladder fall
over, jumps onto the platform, and as Schwarz
picks himself up from the floor, throws the Spanish
screen down on his head. Hastening down-stage, by
the easels.] I told you that you weren’t going to
get me.
Schwarz—[Coming forward.] Let us make
peace. [Tries to embrace her.]
Lulu—Keep away from me, or—— [She throws
the easel with the finished picture at him, so that both
fall crashing to the floor.]
Schwarz—[Screams.] Merciful Heaven!
[138]
Lulu—[Up-stage, right.] You knocked the hole
in it yourself!
Schwarz—I am ruined! Ten weeks’ work, my
journey, my exhibition! Now there is nothing more
to lose! [Plunges after her.]
Lulu—[Springs over the ottoman, over the fallen
step-ladder, and over the platform, down-stage.] A
grave! Don’t fall into it! [She stamps thru the
picture on the floor.] She made a new man out of
him! [Falls forward.]
Schwarz—[Stumbling over the Spanish screen.]
I am merciless now!
Lulu—[Up-stage.] Leave me in peace now.
I’m getting dizzy. O Gott! O Gott!... [Comes
forward and sinks down on the ottoman. Schwarz
locks the door; then seats himself next to her, grasps
her hand, and covers it with kisses—then pauses,
struggling with himself. Lulu opens her eyes wide.]
Lulu—He may come back.
Schwarz—How d’you feel?
Lulu—As if I had fallen into the water....
Schwarz—I love you.
Lulu—One time, I loved a student.
Schwarz—Nellie⁠——
Lulu—With four-and-twenty scars⁠——
Schwarz—I love you, Nellie.
Lulu—My name isn’t Nellie. [Schwarz kisses
her.] It’s Lulu.
Schwarz—I would call you Eve.
Lulu—Do you know what time it is?
Schwarz—[Looking at his watch.] Half past
[139]
ten. [Lulu takes the watch and opens the case.]
You don’t love me.
Lulu—Yes, I do.... It’s five minutes after half
past ten.
Schwarz—Give me a kiss, Eve!
Lulu—[Takes him by the chin and kisses him.
Throws the watch in the air and catches it.] You
smell of tobacco.
Schwarz—Call me Walter.
Lulu—It would be uncomfortable to⁠——
Schwarz—You’re just making believe!
Lulu—You’re making believe yourself, it seems
to me. I make believe? What makes you think
that? I’ve never needed to do that.
Schwarz—[Rises, disconcerted, passing his hand
over his forehead.] God in Heaven! The world is
strange to me⁠——
Lulu—[Screams.] Only don’t kill me!
Schwarz—[Instantly whirling round.] Thou
hast never yet loved!
Lulu—[Half raising herself.] You have
never yet loved...!
Dr. Goll—[Outside.] Open the door!
Lulu—[Already sprung to her feet.] Hide me!
O God, hide me!
Dr. Goll—[Pounding on the door.] Open the
door!
Lulu—[Holding back Schwarz as he goes toward
the door.] He will strike me dead!
Dr. Goll—[Hammering.] Open the door!
Lulu—[Sunk down before Schwarz, gripping his
[140]
knees.] He’ll beat me to death! He’ll beat me to
death!
Schwarz—Stand up.... [The door falls crashing
into the studio. Dr. Goll with bloodshot eyes
rushes upon Schwarz and Lulu, brandishing his
stick.]
Dr. Goll—You dogs! You.... [Pants,
struggles for breath a few seconds, and falls headlong
to the ground. Schwarz’s knees tremble. Lulu
has fled to the door. Pause.]
Schwarz—Mister—Doctor—Doc—Doctor
Goll⁠——
Lulu—[In the door.] Please, tho, first put the
studio in order.
Schwarz—Dr. Goll! [Leans over.] Doc—[Steps
back.] He’s cut his forehead. Help me to
lay him on the ottoman.
Lulu—[Shudders backward in terror.] No.
No....
Schwarz—[Trying to turn him over.] Dr. Goll.
Lulu—He doesn’t hear.
Schwarz—But you, help me, please.
Lulu—The two of us together couldn’t lift him.
Schwarz—[Straightening up.] We must send
for a doctor.
Lulu—He is fearfully heavy.
Schwarz—[Getting his hat.] Please, tho, be so
good as to put the place a little to rights while
I’m away. [He goes out.]
Lulu—He’ll spring up all at once. [Intensely.]
Bussi!—He just won’t notice anything. [Comes
[141]
down-stage in a wide circle.] He sees my feet, and
watches every step I take. He has his eye on me
everywhere. [Touches him with her toe.] Bussi!
[Flinching, backward.] It’s serious with him. The
dance is over. He’ll send me to prison. What shall
I do? [Leans down to the floor.] A strange, wild
face! [Getting up.] And no one to do him the
last services—isn’t that sad! [Schwarz returns.]
Schwarz—Still not come to himself?
Lulu—[Down right.] What shall I do?
Schwarz—[Bending over Goll.] Doctor Goll.
Lulu—I almost think it’s serious.
Schwarz—Talk decently!
Lulu—He wouldn’t say that to me. He makes
me dance for him when he doesn’t feel well.
Schwarz—The doctor will be here in a moment.
Lulu—Doctoring won’t help him.
Schwarz—But people do what they can, in such
cases!
Lulu—He doesn’t believe in it.
Schwarz—Don’t you want to—at any rate—put
something on?
Lulu—Yes,—right off.
Schwarz—What are you waiting for?
Lulu—Please....
Schwarz—What is it?
Lulu—Shut his eyes.
Schwarz—You make me shiver.
Lulu—Not nearly so much as you make me!
Schwarz—I?
Lulu—You’re a born criminal.
[142]
Schwarz—Aren’t you the least bit touched by
this moment?
Lulu—It hits me, too, some.
Schwarz—Please, just you keep still now!
Lulu—It hits you some, too.
Schwarz—You really didn’t need to add that, at
such a moment!
Lulu—Please...!
Schwarz—Do what you think necessary. I don’t
know how.
Lulu—[Left of Goll.] He’s looking at me.
Schwarz—[Right of Goll.] And at me, too.
Lulu—You’re a coward!
Schwarz—[Shuts Goll’s eyes with his handkerchief.]
It’s the first time in my life I’ve ever been
condemned to that.
Lulu—Didn’t you do it to your mother?
Schwarz—[Nervously.] No.
Lulu—You were away, perhaps.
Schwarz—No!
Lulu—Or else you were afraid?
Schwarz—[Violently.] No!
Lulu—[Shivering, backward.] I didn’t mean to
insult you.
Schwarz—She’s still alive.
Lulu—Then you still have somebody.
Schwarz—She’s as poor as a beggar.
Lulu—I know what that is.
Schwarz—Don’t laugh at me!
Lulu—Now I am rich⁠——
[143]
Schwarz—It gives me cold shudders—— [Goes
right.] She can’t help it!
Lulu—[To herself.] What’ll I do?
Schwarz—[To himself.] Absolutely uncivilized!
[They look at each other mistrustfully. Schwarz
goes over to her and grips her hand.] Look me in
the eyes!
Lulu—[Apprehensively.] What do you want?
Schwarz—[Takes her to the ottoman and makes
her sit next to him.] Look me in the eyes.
Lulu—I see myself in them as Pierrot.
Schwarz—[Shoves her from him.] Confounded
dancer-ing!
Lulu—I must change my clothes⁠——
Schwarz—[Holds her back.] One question⁠——
Lulu—I can’t answer it.
Schwarz—Can you speak the truth?
Lulu—I don’t know.
Schwarz—Do you believe in a Creator?
Lulu—I don’t know.
Schwarz—Can you swear by anything?
Lulu—I don’t know. Leave me alone. You’re
mad.
Schwarz—What do you believe in, then?
Lulu—I don’t know.
Schwarz—Have you no soul, then?
Lulu—I don’t know.
Schwarz—Have you ever once loved——?
Lulu—I don’t know.
Schwarz—[Gets up, goes right, to himself.]
She doesn’t know!
[144]
Lulu—[Without moving.] I don’t know.
Schwarz—[Glancing at Goll.] He knows.
Lulu—[Nearer him.] What do you want to
know?
Schwarz—[Angrily.] Go, get dressed! [Lulu
goes into the bedroom. To Goll.] Would I could
change with you, you dead man! I give her back to
you. I give my youth to you, too. I lack the courage
and the faith. I’ve had to wait patiently too
long. It’s too late for me. I haven’t grown up big
enough for happiness. I have a hellish fear of it.
Wake up! I didn’t touch her. He opens his mouth.
Mouth open and eyes shut, like the children. With
me it’s the other way round. Wake up, wake up!
[Kneels down and binds his handkerchief round the
dead man’s head.] Here I beseech Heaven to make
me able to be happy—to give me the strength and
the freedom of soul to be just a weeny mite happy!
For her sake, only for her sake. [Lulu
comes out of the bedroom, completely dressed, her
hat on, and her right hand under her left arm.]
Lulu—[Raising her left arm, to Schwarz.]
Would you hook me up here? My hand trembles.
CURTAIN
[145]
Scene—A very ornamental parlor. Entrance-door
rear, left. Curtained entrances right and left,
steps leading up to the right one. On the back
wall over the fireplace, Lulu’s Pierrot picture
in a magnificent frame. Right, above the steps,
a tall mirror; facing it, right centre, a chaise
longue. Left, an ebony writing-table. Centre,
a few chairs around a little Chinese table.
Lulu stands motionless before the mirror, in
a green silk morning-dress. She frowns, passes
a hand over her forehead, feels her cheeks, and
draws back from the mirror with a discouraged,
almost angry, look. Frequently turning round,
she goes left, opens a cigarette-case on the writing-table,
lights herself a cigarette, looks for a
book among those that are lying on the table,
takes one, and lies down on the chaise longue
opposite the mirror. After reading a moment,
she lets the book sink, and nods seriously to herself
in the glass; then resumes reading.
Schwarz enters, left, palette and brushes in
hand, and bends over Lulu, kisses her on the
forehead, and goes up the steps, right.
Schwarz—[Turning in the doorway.] Eve!
Lulu—[Smiling.] At your orders?
[146]
Schwarz—Seems to me you look extra charming
to-day.
Lulu—[With a glance at the mirror.] Depends
on what you expect.
Schwarz—Your hair breathes out a morning
freshness....
Lulu—I’ve just come out of the water.
Schwarz—[Approaching her.] I’ve an awful lot
to do to-day.
Lulu—You tell yourself you have.
Schwarz—[Lays his palette and brushes down on
the carpet, and sits on the edge of the couch.]
What are you reading?
Lulu—[Reads.] “Suddenly she heard an anchor
of refuge come nodding up the stairs.”
Schwarz—Who under the sun writes so absorbingly?
Lulu—[Reading.] “It was the postman with a
money-order.” [Henriette, the servant, comes in,
upper left, with a hat-box on her arm and a little
tray of letters which she puts on the table.]
Henriette—The mail. I’m going to take your
hat to the milliner, madam. Anything else?
Lulu—No. [Schwarz signs to her to go out,
which she does, slyly smiling.]
Schwarz—What were all the things you dreamt
about last night?
Lulu—You’ve asked me that twice already this
morning.
Schwarz—[Rises, takes up the letters.] News
[147]
makes me tremble. Every day I fear the world may
go to pieces. [Giving Lulu a letter.] For you.
Lulu—[Sniffs at the paper.] Madame Corticelli.
[Hides it in her bosom.]
Schwarz—[Skimming a letter.] My Sama-queca-dancer
sold—for fifty thousand marks!
Lulu—Who’s that from?
Schwarz—Sedelmeier in Paris. That’s the third
picture since our marriage. I hardly know how to
escape my good fortune!
Lulu—[Pointing to the letters.] There are
more there.
Schwarz—[Opening an engagement announcement.]
See. [Gives it to Lulu.]
Lulu—[Reads.] “Sir Henry von Zarnikow has
the honor to announce the engagement of his daughter,
Charlotte Marie Adelaide, to Doctor Ludwig
Schön.”
Schwarz—[As he opens another letter.] At last!
He’s been an eternal while evading a public engagement.
I can’t understand it—a man of his standing
and influence. What can be in the way of his marriage?
Lulu—What is that that you’re reading?
Schwarz—An invitation to take part in the international
exhibition at St. Petersburg. I have no
idea what to paint for it.
Lulu—Some entrancing girl or other, of course.
Schwarz—Will you be willing to pose for it?
Lulu—God knows there are other pretty girls
enough in existence!
[148]
Schwarz—But with no other model—tho she be
as racy as hell—can I so fully show the depth and
range of my powers.
Lulu—Then I must, I suppose. Mightn’t it go
as well, perhaps, lying down?
Schwarz—Really, I’d like best to leave the composition
to your taste. [Folding up the letters.]
Don’t let’s forget to congratulate Schön to-day, anyway.
[Goes left and shuts the letters in the writing-table.]
Lulu—But we did that a long time ago.
Schwarz—For his bride’s sake.
Lulu—You can write to him again if you want.
Schwarz—And now to work! [Takes up his
brushes and palette, kisses Lulu, goes up the steps,
right, and turns around in the doorway.] Eve!
Lulu—[Lets her book sink, smiling.] Your
pleasure?
Schwarz—[Approaching her.] I feel every day
as if I were seeing you for the very first time.
Lulu—You’re a terror.
Schwarz—You make me one. [He sinks on his
knees by the couch and caresses her hand.]
Lulu—[Stroking his hair.] You’re using me up
fast.
Schwarz—You are mine. And you are never
more ensnaring than when you ought for God’s sake
to be, just once, real ugly for a couple of hours!
Since I’ve had you, I have had nothing further. I’ve
lost hold of myself entirely.
[149]
Lulu—Don’t be so passionate! [Bell rings in
the corridor.]
Schwarz—[Pulling himself together.] Confound
it!
Lulu—No one at home!
Schwarz—Perhaps it’s the art-dealer⁠——
Lulu—And if it’s the Chinese Emperor!
Schwarz—One moment. [Exit.]
Lulu—[Visionary.] Thou? Thou? [Closes
her eyes.]
Schwarz—[Coming back.] A beggar, who says
he was in the war. I have no small change on me.
[Taking up his palette and brushes.] It’s high
time, too, that I should finally go to work. [Goes
out, right. Lulu touches herself up before the
glass, strokes back her hair, and goes out, returning
leading in Schigolch.]
Schigolch—I’d thought he was more of a swell—a
little more glory to him. He’s sort of embarrassed.
He quaked a little in the knees when he saw
me in front of him.
Lulu—[Shoving a chair round for him.] How
can you beg from him, too?
Schigolch—I’ve dragged my seventy-seven
spring-times here just for that. You told me he
kept at his painting in the mornings.
Lulu—He hadn’t got quite awake yet. How
much do you need?
Schigolch—Two hundred, if you have that much
handy. Personally, I’d like three hundred. Some
of my clients have evaporated.
[150]
Lulu—[Goes to the writing-table and rummages
in the drawers.] Whew, I’m tired!
Schigolch—[Looking round him.] This helped
bring me, too. I’ve been wanting a long time to see
how things were looking with you now.
Lulu—Well?
Schigolch—It gives one cold shivers. [Looking
up.] Like with me fifty years ago. Instead of the
loafing chairs we still had rusty old sabres then.
Devil, but you’ve brought it pretty far! [Scuffing.]
Carpets....
Lulu—[Giving him two bills.] I like best to
walk on them bare-footed.
Schigolch—[Scanning Lulu’s portrait.] Is
that you?
Lulu—[Winking.] Pretty fine?
Schigolch—If that’s the sort of thing.
Lulu—Have something sweet?
Schigolch—What?
Lulu—[Getting up.] Elixir de Spaa.
Schigolch—That doesn’t help me—— Does he
drink?
Lulu—[Taking a decanter and glasses from a
cupboard near the fireplace.] Not yet. [Coming
down-stage.] The cordial has such various effects!
Schigolch—He comes to blows?
Lulu—He goes to sleep. [She fills the two
glasses.]
Schigolch—When he’s drunk, you can see right
into his insides.
[151]
Lulu—I’d rather not. [Sits opposite Schigolch.]
Talk to me.
Schigolch—The streets keep on getting longer,
and my legs shorter.
Lulu—And your harmonica?
Schigolch—Wheezes, like me with my asthma.
I just keep a-thinking it isn’t worth the trouble to
make it better. [They clink glasses.]
Lulu—[Emptying her glass.] I’d been thinking
that at last you were⁠——
Schigolch—At last I was up and away? I
thought so, too. But no matter how early the sun
goes down, still we aren’t let lie quiet. I’m hoping
for winter. Perhaps then my [coughing]—my—my
asthma will invent some opportunity to carry
me off.
Lulu—[Filling the glasses.] Do you think they
could have forgotten you up there?
Schigolch—Would be possible, for it certainly
isn’t going like it usually does. [Stroking her
knee.] Now you tell—not seen you a long time—my
little Lulu.
Lulu—[Jerking back, smiling.] Life is beyond
me!
Schigolch—What do you know about it? You’re
still so young!
Lulu—That you call me Lulu.
Schigolch—Lulu, isn’t it? Have I ever called
you anything else?
Lulu—I haven’t been called Lulu since man can
remember.
[152]
Schigolch—Some other kind of name?
Lulu—Lulu sounds to me quite antediluvian.
Schigolch—Children! Children!
Lulu—My name now is⁠——
Schigolch—As if the principle wasn’t always the
same!
Lulu—You mean⁠——
Schigolch—What is it now?
Lulu—Eve.
Schigolch—Leapt, hopped, skipped, jumped....
Lulu—That’s what I answer to.
Schigolch—[Gazing round.] This is the way I
dreamt it for you. It’s your natural bent. [Seeing
Lulu sprinkling herself with perfume.] What’s
that?
Lulu—Heliotrope.
Schigolch—Does that smell better than you?
Lulu—[Sprinkling him.] That needn’t bother
you any more.
Schigolch—Who would have dreamt of this royal
luxury before!
Lulu—When I think back—Ugh!
Schigolch—[Stroking her knee.] How’s it
going with you, then? You still keep at the French?
Lulu—I lie and sleep.
Schigolch—That’s genteel. That always looks
like something. And afterwards?
Lulu—I stretch—till it cracks.
Schigolch—And when it has cracked?
Lulu—What do you mind about that?
Schigolch—What do I mind about that? What
[153]
do I mind? I’d rather live till the last trump and
renounce all heavenly joys than leave my Lulu deprived
of anything down here behind me. What do
I mind about that? It’s my sympathy. To be sure,
my better self is already transfigured—but I still
have some understanding of this world.
Lulu—I haven’t.
Schigolch—You’re too well off.
Lulu—[Shuddering.] Idiot....
Schigolch—Better than with the old dancing-bear?
Lulu—[Sadly.] I don’t dance any more.
Schigolch—He got his call all right.
Lulu—Now I am—— [Stops.]
Schigolch—Speak out from your heart, child!
I believed in you when there was no more to be seen
in you than your two big eyes. What are you now?
Lulu—A beast....
Schigolch—The deuce you—— And what kind
of a beast? A fine beast! An elegant beast! A
glorified beast!—Well, let them bury me quickly!
We’re through with prejudices—even with the one
against the corpse-washer.
Lulu—You needn’t be afraid that you will be
washed once more.
Schigolch—Doesn’t matter, either. One gets
dirty again.
Lulu—[Sprinkling him.] It would call you back
to life again!
Schigolch—We are mud.
[154]
Lulu—I beg your pardon! I rub grease into
myself every day and then powder on top of it.
Schigolch—Probably worth while, too, on the
dressed-up mucker’s account.
Lulu—It makes the skin like satin.
Schigolch—As if it weren’t just dirt all the
same!
Lulu—Thank you. I wish to be worth nibbling
at!
Schigolch—We are. Give a big dinner down below
there pretty soon. Keep open house.
Lulu—Your guests will hardly overeat themselves
at it.
Schigolch—Patience, girl! Your worshippers
won’t put you in alcohol, either. It’s “schöne
Melusine” as long as it keeps reacting. Afterwards?
They don’t take it at the zoölogical garden. [Rising.]
The gentle beasties might get stomach-cramps.
Lulu—[Getting up.] Have you enough?
Schigolch—Enough and some to spare for planting
a juniper on my grave.—I’ll find my own way
out. [Exit. Lulu follows him, and presently returns
with Dr. Schön.]
Schön—What’s your father doing here?
Lulu—What’s the matter?
Schön—If I were your husband that man would
never cross my threshold.
Lulu—You can be intimate with me. He’s not
here. [Referring to Schwarz.]
Schön—Thank you, I’d rather not.
[155]
Lulu—I don’t understand.
Schön—I know you don’t. [Offering her a seat.]
That is just the point I’d like to speak to you about.
Lulu—[Sitting down uncertainly.] Then why
didn’t you yesterday?
Schön—Please, nothing now about yesterday. I
did tell you two years ago.
Lulu—[Nervously.] Oh, yes,—hm!
Schön—Please be kind enough to cease your visits
to my house.
Lulu—May I offer you an elixir⁠——
Schön—Thanks. No elixir. Have you understood
me? [Lulu shakes her head.] Good. You
have the choice. You force me to the most extreme
measures:—either act in accordance with your station⁠——
Lulu—Or?
Schön—Or—you compel me—I may have to turn
to that person who is responsible for your behavior.
Lulu—How can you imagine that——?
Schön—I shall request your husband, himself to
keep watch over your doings. [Lulu rises, goes up
the steps, right.] Where are you going?
Lulu—[Calls thru the curtains.] Walter!
Schön—[Springing up.] Are you mad?
Lulu—[Turning round.] Aha!
Schön—I have made the most superhuman efforts
to raise you in society. You can be ten times as
proud of your name as of your intimacy with me.
[156]
Lulu—[Comes down the steps and puts her arm
around Schön’s neck.] Why are you still afraid,
now that you’re at the zenith of your hopes?
Schön—No comedy! The zenith of my hopes?
I am at last engaged: I have still to hope that I may
bring my bride into a clean house.
Lulu—[Sitting.] She has developed delightfully
in the two years!
Schön—She no longer looks thru one so earnestly.
Lulu—She is now, for the first time, a woman.
We can meet each other wherever seems suitable to
you.
Schön—We shall meet each other nowhere but in
the presence of your husband!
Lulu—You don’t believe yourself what you say.
Schön—Then he must believe it, at least. Go
on and call him! Thru his marriage to you, thru all
that I’ve done for him, he has become my friend.
Lulu—[Rising.] Mine, too.
Schön—And that way I’ll cut down the sword
over my head.
Lulu—You have, indeed, put chains upon me.
But I owe my happiness to you. You will get
friends by the crowd as soon as you have a pretty
young wife again.
Schön—You judge women by yourself! He’s got
the sense of a child or he would have tracked out
your doublings and windings long ago.
Lulu—I only wish he would! Then, at last he’d
get out of his swaddling-clothes. He puts his trust
in the marriage contract he has in his pocket.
[157]
Trouble is past and gone. One can now give oneself
and let oneself go as if one were at home. That isn’t
the sense of a child! It’s banal! He has no
education; he sees nothing; he sees neither me nor
himself; he is blind, blind, blind....
Schön—[Half to himself.] When his eyes
open!
Lulu—Open his eyes for him! I’m going to ruin.
I’m neglecting myself. He doesn’t know me at all.
What am I to him? He calls me darling and little
devil. He would say the same to any piano-teacher.
He makes no pretensions. Everything is all right, to
him. That comes from his never in his life having
felt the need of intercourse with women.
Schön—If that’s true!
Lulu—He admits it perfectly openly.
Schön—A man who has painted them, rags and
tags and velvet gowns, since he was fourteen.
Lulu—Women make him anxious. He trembles
for his health and comfort. But he isn’t afraid of
me!
Schön—How many girls would deem themselves
God knows how blessed in your situation.
Lulu—[Softly pleading.] Seduce him. Corrupt
him. You know how. Take him into bad company—you
know the people. I am nothing to him but
a woman, just woman. He makes me feel so ridiculous.
He will be prouder of me. He doesn’t know
any differences. I’m thinking my head off, day and
night, how to shake him up. In my despair I dance
[158]
the can-can. He yawns; and drivels something
about obscenity.
Schön—Nonsense. He is an artist, though.
Lulu—At least he believes he is.
Schön—That’s the chief thing!
Lulu—When I pose for him.... He believes,
too, that he’s a famous man.
Schön—We have made him one.
Lulu—He believes everything. He’s as diffident
as a thief, and lets himself be lied to, till one loses
all respect! When we first got to know each other
I made him believe I had never loved before—[Schön
falls into an easy-chair.] Otherwise he
would really have taken me for some sort of reprobate!
Schön—You make God knows what exorbitant demands
on legitimate relations!
Lulu—I make no exorbitant demands. Often I
even dream still of Goll.
Schön—He was, at any rate, not banal!
Lulu—He is there, as if he had never been away.
Only he walks as tho in his socks. He isn’t angry
with me; he’s awfully sad. And then he is fearful,
as tho he were there without the permission of the
police. Otherwise, he feels at ease with us. Only
he can’t quite get over my having thrown away so
much money since⁠——
Schön—You yearn for the whip once more?
Lulu—Maybe. I don’t dance any more.
Schön—Teach him to do it.
Lulu—A waste of trouble.
[159]
Schön—Out of a hundred women, ninety educate
their husbands to suit themselves.
Lulu—He loves me.
Schön—That’s fatal, of course.
Lulu—He loves me⁠——
Schön—That is an unbridgeable abyss.
Lulu—He doesn’t know me, but he loves me! If
he had anything approaching a true idea of me, he’d
tie a stone around my neck and sink me in the sea
where it’s deepest.
Schön—Let’s finish this. [He gets up.]
Lulu—As you say.
Schön—I’ve married you off. Twice I have married
you off. You live in luxury. I’ve created a
position for your husband. If that doesn’t satisfy
you, and he laughs in his sleeve at it,—I don’t indulge
in ideal expectations, but—leave me out of the
game, out of it!
Lulu—[Resolutely.] If I belong to any person
on this earth, I belong to you. Without you I’d
be—I won’t say where. You took me by the hand,
gave me food to eat, had me dressed,—when I was
going to steal your watch. Do you think that can
be forgotten? Anybody else would have called the
police. You sent me to school, and had me learn
manners. Who but you in the whole world has ever
had any kindness for me? I’ve danced and posed,
and was glad to be able to earn my living that way.
But love at command, I can’t!
Schön—[Raising his voice.] Leave me out!
Do what you will. I haven’t come to raise a row;
[160]
I’ve come to shake myself free of it. My engagement
is costing me sacrifices enough! I had imagined
that with a healthy young husband—and a
woman of your years can hope for none better—you
would, at last, have been contented. If you are
under obligations to me, don’t throw yourself a third
time in my way! Am I to wait yet longer before putting
my pile in security? Am I to risk letting the
final success of all my concessions during the last
two years slip from me? What good is it to me to
have you married, when you can be seen going in
and out of my house at every hour of the day?—Why
the devil didn’t Dr. Goll stay alive just one
year more! With him you were in safe keeping.
Then I’d have had my wife long since under my roof!
Lulu—And what would you have had then? The
kid gets on your nerves. The child is too uncorrupted
for you. She’s been much too carefully
brought up. What should I have against your marriage?
But you’re making a big mistake if you
think that your imminent marriage warrants you
in expressing your contempt of me!
Schön—Contempt?—I shall soon give the child
the right idea. If anything is contemptible, it’s
your intrigues!
Lulu—[Laughing.] Am I jealous of the child?
That never once entered my head.
Schön—Then why talk about the child? The
child is not even a whole year younger than you are.
Leave me my freedom to live what life I still have.
No matter how the child’s been brought up, she’s
[161]
got her five senses just like you.... [Schwarz
appears, right, brush in hand.]
Schwarz—What’s the matter here?
Lulu—[To Schön.] Well? Go on. Talk.
Schwarz—What’s the matter with you two?
Lulu—Nothing that touches you⁠——
Schön—[Sharply.] Quiet!
Lulu—He’s had enough of me. [Schwarz leads
her off, to the right.]
Schön—[Turning over the leaves in one of the
books on the table.] It had to come out—I must
have my hands free at last!
Schwarz—[Coming back.] Is that any way to
jest?
Schön—[Pointing to a chair.] Please.
Schwarz—What is it?
Schön—Please.
Schwarz—[Seating himself.] Well?
Schön—[Seating himself.] You have married
half a million....
Schwarz—Is it gone?
Schön—Not a penny.
Schwarz—Explain to me the peculiar scene....
Schön—You have married half a million⁠——
Schwarz—No one can make a crime of that.
Schön—You have created a name for yourself.
You can work unmolested. You need to deny yourself
no wish⁠——
Schwarz—What have you two got against me?
Schön—For six months you’ve been revelling in
all the heavens. You have a wife whom the world
[162]
envies you, and she deserves a man whom she can
respect⁠——
Schwarz—Doesn’t she respect me?
Schön—No.
Schwarz—[Depressed.] I come from the dark
depths of society. She is above me. I cherish no
more ardent wish than to become her equal. [Offers
Schön his hand.] Thank you.
Schön—[Pressing it, half embarrassed.] Don’t
mention it.
Schwarz—[With determination.] Speak!
Schön—Keep a little more watch on her.
Schwarz—I—on her?
Schön—We are not children! We don’t trifle!
We live!—She demands that she be taken seriously.
Her value gives her a perfect right to be.
Schwarz—What does she do, then?
Schön—You have married half a million!
Schwarz—[Rises; beside himself.] She——?
Schön—[Takes him by the shoulder.] No, that’s
not the way! [Forces him to sit.] We have a very
grave matter here to discuss.
Schwarz—What does she do?
Schön—First count over on your fingers all you
have to thank her for, and then⁠——
Schwarz—What does she do—man!
Schön—And then make yourself responsible for
your failings,—no one else.
Schwarz—With whom? With whom?
Schön—If we should shoot each other⁠——
Schwarz—Since when, then?
[163]
Schön—[Evasive.] —I have not come here to
make a scandal, but to rescue you from scandal.
Schwarz—[Shaking his head.] You have misunderstood
her.
Schön—[Embarrassed.] That gets us nowhere.
I can’t see you go on living in blindness. The girl
deserves to be a respectable woman. Since I have
known her she has improved as she developed.
Schwarz—Since you have known her? Since
when have you known her then?
Schön—Since about her twelfth year.
Schwarz—[Bewildered.] She never told me that.
Schön—She used to sell flowers in front of the
Alhambra Café. Every evening between twelve and
two she would press in among the guests, bare-footed.
Schwarz—She told me nothing of that.
Schön—She did right there. I’m telling you, so
you may see that hers is not a case of moral degeneracy.
The girl is, on the contrary, of extraordinarily
good disposition.
Schwarz—She said she had grown up with an
aunt.
Schön—That was the woman I gave her to. She
was her best pupil. The mothers used to make her
an example to their children. She has the feeling
for duty. It is simply and solely your mistake if
you have till now neglected to appeal to the best
in her.
Schwarz—[Sobbing.] O God!⁠——
Schön—[With emphasis.] No O God! Of the
[164]
happiness you have enjoyed nothing can be changed.
The past is past. You overrate yourself against
your better knowledge if you persuade yourself you
will lose. You stand to gain. But with “O God”
nothing is gained. I have never done you a greater
kindness: I speak out plainly and offer you my help.
Don’t show yourself unworthy of it!
Schwarz—[From now on more and more broken
up.] When I first knew her, she told me she had
never loved before.
Schön—When a widow says that—— It does
her credit that she chose you for a husband. Make
the same claims on yourself and your happiness is
without a blot.
Schwarz—She says he had her wear short dresses.
Schön—But he married her! That was her master-stroke.
How she brought the man to it is beyond
me. But you must know by now. You are enjoying
the fruits of her diplomacy.
Schwarz—Where did Dr. Goll get to know her?
How?
Schön—Through me! It was after my wife’s
death, when I was making the first advances to my
present fiancée. She thrust herself between us.
She had set her heart on becoming my wife.
Schwarz—[As if seized with a horrible suspicion.]
And then when her husband died?
Schön—You married half a million!
Schwarz—[Wailing.] Oh, to have stayed where
I was! To have died of hunger!
Schön—[Superior.] Do you think, then, that I
[165]
make no compromises? Who is there that does not
compromise? You have married half a million.
You are to-day one of our foremost artists. Such
things can’t be done without money. You are not
the man to sit in judgment on her. You can’t possibly
treat an origin like Mignon’s according to the
notions of bourgeois society.
Schwarz—[Quite distraught.] Whom are you
speaking of?
Schön—Of her father! You’re an artist, I say:
your ideals are on a different plane from those of a
wage-worker.
Schwarz—I don’t understand a word of all that.
Schön—I am speaking of the inhuman conditions
out of which, thanks to her good management, the
girl has developed into what she is!
Schwarz—Who?
Schön—Who? Your wife.
Schwarz—Eve?
Schön—I called her Mignon.
Schwarz—I thought her name was Nellie?
Schön—Dr. Goll called her so.
Schwarz—I called her Eve⁠——
Schön—What her real name is I don’t know.
Schwarz—[Absently.] Perhaps she knows.
Schön—With a father like hers, she is, with all
her faults, an utter miracle. I don’t understand
you⁠——
Schwarz—He died in a madhouse⁠——
Schön—He was here just now!
Schwarz—Who was here?
[166]
Schön—Her father.
Schwarz—Here—in my home?
Schön—He squeezed by me as I came in. And
there are the two glasses still.
Schwarz—She says he died in the madhouse.
Schön—[Encouragingly.] Let her feel your authority!
Only make her render you unconditional
obedience, and she asks no more. With Dr. Goll she
was in heaven, and there was no joking him.
Schwarz—[Shaking his head.] She said she
had never loved⁠——
Schön—But start with yourself. Pull yourself
together!
Schwarz—She has sworn⁠——
Schön—You can’t expect a sense of duty in her
before you know your own task.
Schwarz—By her mother’s grave!
Schön—She never knew her mother, let alone the
grave. Her mother hasn’t got a grave.
Schwarz—I don’t fit in society. [He is in desperation.]
Schön—What’s the matter?
Schwarz—Pain—horrible pain!
Schön—[Gets up, steps back; after a pause.]
Guard her for yourself, because she’s yours.—The
moment is decisive. To-morrow she may be lost to
you.
Schwarz—[Pointing to his breast.] Here, here.
Schön—You have married half——[Reflecting.]
She is lost to you if you let this moment slip!
[167]
Schwarz—If I could weep! Oh, if I could cry
out!
Schön—[With a hand on his shoulder.] You’re
suffering⁠——
Schwarz—[Getting up, apparently quiet.] You
are right, quite right.
Schön—[Gripping his hand.] Where are you
going?
Schwarz—To speak with her.
Schön—Right! [Accompanies him to the door,
left. Coming back.] That was tough work.
[After a pause, looking right.] He had taken her
into the studio before, tho...? [A fearful
groan, left. He hurries to the door and finds it
locked.] Open! Open the door!
Lulu—[Stepping thru the hangings, right.]
What’s⁠——
Schön—Open it!
Lulu—[Comes down the steps.] That is horrible.
Schön—Have you an ax in the kitchen?
Lulu—He’ll open it right off⁠——
Schön—I can’t kick it in.
Lulu—When he’s had his cry out.
Schön—[Kicking the door.] Open! [To Lulu.]
Bring me an ax.
Lulu—Send for the doctor⁠——
Schön—You are not yourself.
Lulu—It serves you right. [Bell rings in the
corridor. Schön and Lulu stare at each other.
[168]
Then Schön slips up-stage and stands in the doorway.]
Schön—I mustn’t let myself be seen here now.
Lulu—Perhaps it’s the art-dealer. [The bell
rings again.]
Schön—But if we don’t answer it—— [Lulu
steals toward the door; but Schön holds her.] Stop.
It sometimes happens that one is not just at hand—[He
goes out on tiptoe. Lulu turns back to the
locked door and listens. Schön returns with
Alva.] Please be quiet.
Alva—[Very excited.] A revolution has broken
out in Paris!
Schön—Be quiet.
Alva—[To Lulu.] You’re as pale as death.
Schön—[Rattling at the door.] Walter! Walter!
[A death-rattle is heard behind the door.]
Lulu—God pity you.
Schön—Haven’t you brought an ax?
Lulu—If there’s one there—— [Goes slowly out,
upper left.]
Alva—He’s just keeping us in suspense.
Schön—A revolution has broken out in Paris?
Alva—Up in the office the editors are tearing
their hair. Not one of them knows what to write
about it. [The bell rings in the corridor.]
Schön—[Kicking against the door.] Walter!
Alva—Shall I run against it?
Schön—I can do that. Who may be coming
now? [Standing up.] That’s what it is to enjoy
life and let others take the consequences!
[169]
Lulu—[Coming back with a kitchen-ax.] Henriette
has come home.
Schön—Shut the door behind you.
Alva—Give it here. [Takes the ax and pounds
with it between the jamb and the lock.]
Schön—You must hold it nearer the end.
Alva—It’s cracking— [The lock gives; Alva
lets the ax fall and staggers back. Pause.]
Lulu—[To Schön, pointing to the door.] After
you. [Schön flinches, drops back.] Are you getting—dizzy?
[Schön wipes the sweat from his
forehead and goes in.]
Alva—[From the couch.] Ghastly!
Lulu—[Stopping in the doorway, finger on lips,
cries out sharply.] Oh! Oh! [Hurries to Alva.]
I can’t stay here.
Alva—Horrible!
Lulu—[Taking his hand.] Come.
Alva—Where to?
Lulu—I can’t be alone. [Goes out with Alva,
right. Schön comes back, a bunch of keys in his
hand, which shows blood. He pulls the door to, behind
him, goes to the writing-table, opens it, and
writes two notes.]
Alva—[Coming back, right.] She’s changing
her clothes.
Schön—She has gone?
Alva—To her room. She’s changing her clothes.
[Schön rings. Henriette comes in.]
Schön—You know where Dr. Bernstein lives?
Henriette—Of course, Doctor. Right next door.
[170]
Schön—[Giving her one note.] Take that over
to him, please.
Henriette—In case the doctor is not at home?
Schön—He is at home. [Giving her the other
note.] And take this to police headquarters. Take
a cab. [Henriette goes out.] I am judged!
Alva—My blood has congealed.
Schön—[Toward the left.] The fool!
Alva—He waked up to something, perhaps?
Schön—He has been too much absorbed in himself.
[Lulu appears on the steps, right, in dustcoat
and hat.]
Alva—Where are you going now?
Lulu—Out. I see it on all the walls.
Schön—Where are his papers?
Lulu—In the desk.
Schön—[At the desk.] Where?
Lulu—Lower right-hand drawer. [She kneels
and opens the drawer, emptying the papers on the
floor.] Here. There is nothing to fear. He had
no secrets.
Schön—Now I can just withdraw from the world.
Lulu—[Still kneeling.] Write a pamphlet about
him. Call him Michelangelo.
Schön—What good’ll that do? [Pointing left.]
There lies my engagement.
Alva—That’s the curse of your game!
Schön—Shout it through the streets!
Alva—[Pointing to Lulu.] If you had treated
that girl fairly and justly when my mother died⁠——
Schön—My engagement is bleeding to death there!
[171]
Lulu—[Getting up.] I shan’t stay here any
longer.
Schön—In an hour they’ll be selling extras. I
dare not go across the street!
Lulu—Why, what can you do to help it?
Schön—That’s just it! They’ll stone me for it!
Alva—You must get away—travel.
Schön—To leave the scandal a free field!
Lulu—[By the couch.] Ten minutes ago he was
lying here.
Schön—This is the reward for all I’ve done for
him! In one second he wrecks my whole life for me!
Alva—Control yourself, please!
Lulu—[On the couch.] There’s no one here
but us!
Alva—But look at us!
Schön—[To Lulu.] What do you want to tell
the police?
Lulu—Nothing.
Alva—He didn’t want to remain a debtor to his
destiny.
Lulu—He always had thoughts of death immediately.
Schön—He had thoughts that an ordinary
human can only dream of.
Lulu—He had paid dearly for it.
Alva—He had what we don’t have!
Schön—[Suddenly violent.] I know your motives!
I have no cause to consider you! If you try
every means to prevent having any brothers and
[172]
sisters, that’s all the more reason why I should
get more children.
Alva—You’ve a poor knowledge of men.
Lulu—You get out an extra yourself!
Schön—[With passionate indignation.] He had
no moral sense! [Suddenly controlling himself
again.] Paris in revolution——?
Alva—Our editors act as though they’d been
struck. Everything has stopped dead.
Schön—That’s got to help me over this!—Now
if only the police would come. The minutes are
worth more than gold. [The bell rings in the corridor.]
Alva—There they are—— [Schön starts to the
door. Lulu jumps up.]
Lulu—Wait, you’ve got blood⁠——
Schön—Where?
Lulu—Wait, I’ll wipe it. [Sprinkles her handkerchief
with heliotrope and wipes the blood from
Schön’s hand.]
Schön—It’s your husband’s blood.
Lulu—It leaves no trace.
Schön—Monster!
Lulu—You will marry me, all the same. [The
bell rings in the corridor.] Only have patience,
children. [Schön goes out and returns with Escherich,
a reporter.]
Escherich—[Breathless.] Allow me to—to introduce
myself⁠——
Schön—You’ve run?
[173]
Escherich—[Giving him his card.] From police
headquarters. A suicide, I understand.
Schön—[Reads.] “Fritz Escherich, correspondent
of the ‘News and Novelties.’” Come along.
Escherich—One moment. [Takes out his notebook
and pencil, looks around the parlor, writes
a few words, bows to Lulu, writes, turns to
the broken door, writes.] A kitchen-ax. [Starts
to lift it.]
Schön—[Holding him back.] Excuse me.
Escherich—[Writing.] Door broken open with
a kitchen-ax. [Examines the lock.]
Schön—[His hand on the door.] Look before
you, my dear sir.
Escherich—Now if you will have the kindness to
open the door—— [Schön opens it. Escherich
lets book and pencil fall, clutches at his hair.] Merciful
Heaven! God!
Schön—Look it all over carefully.
Escherich—I can’t look at it!
Schön—[Snorting scornfully.] Then what did
you come here for?
Escherich—To—to cut up—to cut up his throat
with a razor!
Schön—Have you seen it all?
Escherich—That must feel⁠——
Schön—[Draws the door to, steps to the writing-table.]
Sit down. Here is paper and pen. Write.
Escherich—[Mechanically taking his seat.] I
can’t write⁠——
[174]
Schön—[Behind his chair.] Write! Persecution—mania....
Escherich—[Writes.] Per-secu-tion—mania.
[The bell rings in the corridor.]
CURTAIN
[175]
Scene—A theatrical dressing-room, hung with red.
Door upper right. Across upper left corner, a
Spanish screen. Centre, a table set endwise, on
which dance costumes lie. Chair on each side
of this table. Lower right, a smaller table, with
a chair. Lower left, a high, very wide, old-fashioned
arm-chair. Above it, a tall mirror,
with a make-up stand before it holding puff,
rouge, etc., etc.
Alva is at lower right, filling two glasses
with red wine and champagne.
Alva—Never since I began to work for the
stage have I seen the public so wildly enthusiastic.
Lulu—[Voice from behind the screen.] Don’t
give me too much red wine. Will he see me to-day?
Alva—Father?
Lulu—Yes.
Alva—I don’t know if he’s in the theater.
Lulu—Doesn’t he want to see me at all?
Alva—He has so little time.
Lulu—His bride occupies him.
Alva—Speculations. He gives himself no rest.
[Schön enters.] You? We’re just speaking of
you.
[176]
Lulu—Is he there?
Schön—You’re changing?
Lulu—[Peeping over the Spanish screen, to
Schön.] You write in all the papers that I’m the
most gifted danseuse who ever trod the stage, a second
Taglioni and I don’t know what else—and you
haven’t once found me gifted enough to convince
yourself of the fact.
Schön—I have so much to write. You see, I was
convincing to others: there are hardly any seats
left.—You must keep rather more in the proscenium.
Lulu—I must first accustom myself to the light.
Alva—She has kept strictly to her part.
Schön—[To Alva.] You must get more out of
your performers! You don’t know enough yet about
the technique. [To Lulu.] What do you come as
now?
Lulu—As a flower-girl.
Schön—[To Alva.] In tights?
Alva—No. In a skirt to the ankles.
Schön—It would have been better if you hadn’t
bothered with symbolism.
Alva—I look at a dancer’s feet.
Schön—The point is, what the public looks at.
A vision like her has no need, praise God, of your
symbolic mummery.
Alva—The public doesn’t look as if it were being
bored!
Schön—Of course not; because I have been working
the press in her favor for the last six months.
Has the Prince been here?
[177]
Alva—Nobody’s been here.
Schön—Well, that’s what you get for letting a
dancer come on thru two acts in raincoats.
Alva—Who is the Prince?
Schön—Shall we see each other afterwards?
Alva—Are you alone?
Schön—With acquaintances. At Peter’s?
Alva—At twelve?
Schön—At twelve. [Exit.]
Lulu—I’d given up hoping that he’d ever come.
Alva—Don’t let yourself be misled by his grumpy
growls. If you’ll only be careful not to spend all
your strength before the last number begins—[Lulu
steps out in a classical, sleeveless dress, white
with a red border, a bright wreath in her hair and
a basket of flowers in her hands.]
Lulu—He doesn’t seem to have noticed at all how
cleverly you have deployed your performers.
Alva—I won’t blow in sun, moon and stars in the
first act!
Lulu—[Sipping.] You disclose me by degrees.
Alva—And I was well aware that you knew all
about changing costumes.
Lulu—If I’d tried to sell my flowers so before
the Alhambra café, they’d have had me behind lock
and key right off the very first night.
Alva—Why? You were a child!
Lulu—Do you remember how I looked the first
time I came into your room?
Alva—You wore a dark blue dress with black
velvet.
[178]
Lulu—They had to stick me somewhere and didn’t
know where.
Alva—My mother had been lying sick for two
years already then.
Lulu—You were playing theater, and asked me
if I wanted to play, too.
Alva—To be sure! We played theater!
Lulu—I see you still—the way you shoved the
figures back and forth.
Alva—For a long time my most terrible memory
was when all at once I saw clearly into your relations⁠——
Lulu—You got icy curt towards me then.
Alva—Oh, God— I saw in you something so
infinitely far above me. I had perhaps more veneration
for you than for my mother. Think—when
my mother died—I was seventeen—I went and stood
before my father and demanded that he make you
his wife on the spot or we’d have to fight a duel.
Lulu—He told me that at the time.
Alva—Since I’ve grown older, I can only pity him.
He will never comprehend me. There he is making up
a story for himself about a little diplomatic game
that puts me in the rôle of laboring against his marriage
with the Countess.
Lulu—Does she still look out upon the world
as innocently as ever?
Alva—She loves him. I’m convinced of that.
Her family has done everything to induce her to
turn back. I don’t think any sacrifice in the world
would be too great for her to make for his sake.
[179]
Lulu—[Holds out her glass to him.] A little
more, please.
Alva—[Giving it to her.] You’re drinking too
much.
Lulu—He shall learn to believe in my success!
He doesn’t believe in art at all. He only believes
in newspapers.
Alva—He believes in nothing.
Lulu—He brought me into the theater so that
eventually someone might be found rich enough to
marry me.
Alva—Well, all right. Why need that trouble us?
Lulu—I am to feel pleased if I can dance myself
into a millionaire’s heart.
Alva—God forbid that anyone should snatch you
from us!
Lulu—You’ve composed the music for it, tho.
Alva—You know that it was always my desire
to write a piece for you.
Lulu—I am not at all suited to the stage, however.
Alva—You came into the world a dancer!
Lulu—Then why don’t you make your pieces as
interesting as life is, at least?
Alva—Because if we did no man would believe us.
Lulu—If I hadn’t known more about acting than
people on the stage pretend to, what might not have
happened to me?
Alva—I provided your part with all the impossibilities
imaginable, though.
[180]
Lulu—Nobody in the real world is taken in by
hocus-pocus like that.
Alva—It’s enough for me that the public finds
itself most tremendously stirred up.
Lulu—But I’d like to find myself most tremendously
stirred up. [Drinks.]
Alva—You don’t seem to be in need of much more
for that.
Lulu—Can you wonder, since every one of my
scenes has an ulterior purpose? There are some
men down there debating with themselves very
earnestly already.—I can feel that without looking.
Alva—What does it feel like?
Lulu—No one of them has any notion of the
others. Each thinks that he alone is the unhappy
victim.
Alva—But how can you feel that?
Lulu—One gets such an icy thrill running up
one’s body.
Alva—You are incredible. [An electric bell rings
over the door.]
Lulu—My cape.... I shall keep in the proscenium!
Alva—[Putting a wide shawl round her shoulders.]
Here is your cape.
Lulu—He shall have nothing more to fear for his
shameless boosting.
Alva—Keep yourself under control!
Lulu—God grant that I dance the last sparks of
intelligence out of their heads. [Exit.]
Alva—Yes, a more interesting piece could be
[181]
written about her. [Sits, right, and takes out his
notebook. Writes. Looks up.] First act: Dr.
Goll. Rotten already! I can call up Dr. Goll from
purgatory or wherever he’s doing penance for his
orgies, but I’ll be made to answer for his sins.
[Long-continued but much deadened applause and
bravos outside.] That storm sounds like a menagerie
when the meat appears at the cage!—Second act:
Walter Schwarz. Still more impossible! How our
souls do strip off their last coverings in the light
of such lightning-strokes!—Third act?—Is it really
to go on this way? [The attendant opens the door
from outside and lets Escerny enter. He acts as
tho he were at home, and without greeting Alva
takes the chair near the mirror. Alva continues,
not heeding him.] It can not go on this way in the
third act!
Escerny—Up to the middle of the third act it
didn’t seem to be going so well to-day as sometimes.
Alva—I was not on the stage.
Escerny—Now she’s in full career again.
Alva—She’s lengthening each number.
Escerny—I once had the pleasure of meeting the
artiste at Dr. Schön’s house.
Alva—My father introduced her to the public
through certain critiques in his paper.
Escerny—[Bowing slightly.] I was conferring
with Dr. Schön about the publication of my discoveries
at Lake Tanganyika.
Alva—[Bowing slightly.] From what he has let
[182]
drop there can be no doubt that he takes the liveliest
interest in your book.
Escerny—One very good thing about the artiste
is that the audience seems not to exist for her at all.
Alva—As a child she learned the quick changing
of clothes; but I was surprised to discover in her
so important a danseuse.
Escerny—When she dances her solo she grows
intoxicated with her own beauty,—she seems to be
mortally love-sick of it herself.
Alva—Here she comes. [Gets up and opens the
door. Enter Lulu.]
Lulu—[Without wreath or basket, to Alva.]
You’re called for. I was three times before the curtain.
[To Escerny.] Dr. Schön is not in your box?
Escerny—Not in mine.
Alva—[To Lulu.] Didn’t you see him?
Lulu—He is probably away again.
Escerny—He has the furthest lower box on the
left.
Lulu—It seems he is ashamed of me!
Alva—There wasn’t a good seat left for him.
Lulu—[To Alva.] Ask him, though, if he likes
me better now.
Alva—I’ll send him up.
Escerny—He applauded.
Lulu—Did he really?
Alva—Give yourself some rest. [Exit.]
Lulu—I’ve got to change again now.
Escerny—But your dresser isn’t here?
[183]
Lulu—I can do it quicker alone. Where did you
say Dr. Schön was sitting?
Escerny—I saw him in the left parquet-box
farthest back.
Lulu—I’ve still five costumes now before me;
dancing-girl, ballerina, queen of the night, Ariel, and
Lascaris.... [She goes behind the Spanish
screen.]
Escerny—Would you think it possible that at
our first encounter I expected nothing more than
to make the acquaintance of a young lady of the
literary world?... [He sits at the left of the
centre table, and remains there to the end of the
scene.] Have I perhaps erred in my judgment of
your nature, or did I rightly interpret the smile
which the thundering storms of applause called forth
on your lips?—That you are secretly pained at the
necessity of profaning your art before people of
doubtful disinterestedness? [Lulu makes no answer.]
That you would gladly exchange the shimmer
of publicity at every moment for a quiet, sunny
happiness in distinguished seclusion? [Lulu makes
no answer.] That you feel you possess enough dignity
and rank to fetter a man to your feet—in order
to enjoy his utter helplessness?... [Lulu makes no
answer.] That in a comfortable, richly furnished
villa you would feel in a more fitting place than here,—with
unlimited means, to live completely as your
own mistress? [Lulu steps forth in a short,
bright, pleated petticoat and white satin bodice, black
[184]
shoes and stockings, and spurs with bells at her
heels.]
Lulu—[Busy with the lacing of her bodice.] If
there’s just one evening I don’t go on, I dream the
whole night that I’m dancing and feel the next day
as if I’d been racked.
Escerny—But what difference could it make to
you to see before you instead of this mob one spectator,
specially elect?
Lulu—That would make no difference. I don’t
see anybody anyway.
Escerny—A lighted summer-house—the splashing
of the water near at hand.... I am forced in my
exploring-trips to the practice of a quite inhuman
tyranny⁠——
Lulu—[Putting on a pearl necklace before the
mirror.] A good school!
Escerny—And if I now long to deliver myself
unreservedly into the power of a woman, that is a
natural need for relaxation.... Can you imagine
a greater life-happiness for a woman than to have
a man entirely in her power?
Lulu—[Jingling her heels.] Oh, yes!
Escerny—[Disconcerted.] Among men of culture
you will not find one who can help losing his
head over you.
Lulu—Your wishes, however, no one can quite
fulfil without deceiving you.
Escerny—To be deceived by a girl like you must
be ten times more enrapturing than to be uprightly
loved by anybody else.
[185]
Lulu—You have not known what it was to be
uprightly loved by any girl yet in all your life!
[Turning her back to him and pointing.] Would you
undo this knot for me? I’ve laced myself too tight.
I am always so excited getting dressed.
Escerny—[After repeated efforts.] I’m sorry;
I can’t.
Lulu—Then leave it. Perhaps I can. [Goes
left.]
Escerny—I confess that I am lacking in deftness.
Maybe I was a poor student in my relations with
women.
Lulu—And probably you don’t have much opportunity
in Africa, either?
Escerny—[Seriously.] Let me confess to you
frankly that my isolation in the world embitters many
an hour.
Lulu—The knot is almost done....
Escerny—What draws me to you is not your
dancing. It’s your physical and spiritual refinement,
as revealed in every one of your movements. No
one who takes the interest I do in works of art could
be deceived as to that. For ten evenings I’ve been
studying your spiritual life in your dance, until
to-day when you entered as the flower-girl I became
perfectly clear. Yours is a grand nature—unselfish;
you can see no one suffer; you embody the joy of life.
As a wife you will make a man happy above all things....
You are all open-heartedness. You would be
a poor actor. [The bell rings again.]
[186]
Lulu—[Having somewhat loosened her laces,
takes a deep breath and jingles her spurs.] Now I
can breathe again. The curtain is going up. [She
takes from the centre table a skirt-dance costume—of
bright yellow silk, without a waist, closed at
the neck, reaching to the ankles, with wide, loose
sleeves—and throws it over her.] I must dance.
Escerny—[Rises and kisses her hand.] Allow me
to remain here a little while longer.
Lulu—Please stay.
Escerny—I need a little solitude. [Lulu goes
out.] What is to be aristocratic? To be eccentric,
like me? Or to be perfect in body and mind, like
this girl? [Applause and bravos outside.] She
gives me back my faith in humanity,—gives me back
my life. Should not this woman’s children be more
princely, body and soul, than children whose mother
has no more vitality in her than I have felt in me
until to-day? [Sitting, right; ecstatically.] The
dance has ennobled her body.... [Alva enters.]
Alva—One is never sure a moment that some miserable
chance won’t throw the whole performance
out for good. [He throws himself into the big chair,
left, so that the two men are in exactly reversed positions
from their former ones. Both converse somewhat
boredly and apathetically.]
Escerny—But the audience has never shown itself
so responsive before.
Alva—She’s finished the skirt-dance.
Escerny—I hear her coming....
Alva—She isn’t coming. She has no time. She
changes her costume in the wings.
[187]
Escerny—She has two ballet-costumes, if I’m not
mistaken?
Alva—I find the white one more becoming to her
than the rose-color.
Escerny—Do you?
Alva—Don’t you?
Escerny—I find she looks too bodiless in the white
tulle.
Alva—I find she looks too animal in the rose
tulle.
Escerny—I don’t find that.
Alva—The white tulle brings out the child-like
side of her nature more.
Escerny—The rose tulle brings out the womanly
side of her nature more. [The electric bell rings
over the door. Alva jumps up.]
Alva—For heaven’s sake, what is wrong?
Escerny—[Getting up too.] What’s the matter?
[The electric bell continues ringing till after they
go out.]
Alva—Something’s gone wrong there⁠——
Escerny—How can you get so frightened all of
a sudden?
Alva—That must be a hellish confusion! [He
runs out. Escerny follows him. The door remains
open. Faint dance-music heard. Pause. Lulu enters
in a long cloak, and shuts the door to behind her.
She wears a rose-colored ballet costume with flower-garlands.
She walks across the stage and sits down
in the big arm-chair near the mirror. After a pause
Alva returns.]
[188]
Alva—You had a faint?
Lulu—Please lock the door.
Alva—At least come down to the stage.
Lulu—Did you see him?
Alva—See whom?
Lulu—With his fiancée?
Alva—With his—— [To Schön, who enters.]
You might have spared yourself that jest!
Schön—What’s the matter with her? [To Lulu.]
How can you play the scene straight at me!
Lulu—I feel as if I’d been whipped.
Schön—[After bolting the door.] You will dance—as
sure as I’ve taken the responsibility for you!
Lulu—Before your fiancée?
Schön—Have you a right to trouble yourself before
whom? You’ve been engaged here. You receive
your salary....
Lulu—Is that your affair?
Schön—You dance for anyone who buys a ticket.
Whom I sit with in my box has nothing to do with
your business!
Alva—I wish you’d stayed sitting in your box!
[To Lulu.] Tell me, please, what I am to do. [A
knock at the door.] There is the manager. [Calls.]
Yes, in a moment! [To Lulu.] You won’t compel
us to break off the performance?
Schön—[To Lulu.] Onto the stage with you!
Lulu—Let me have just a moment! I can’t now.
I’m utterly miserable.
Alva—The devil take the whole theater crowd!
Lulu—Put in the next number. No one will notice
[189]
if I dance now or in five minutes. There’s no strength
in my feet.
Alva—But you will dance then?
Lulu—As well as I can.
Alva—As badly as you like. [A knock at the
door again.] I’m coming.
Lulu—[When Alva is gone.] You are right to
show me where I belong. You couldn’t do it better
than by letting me dance that skirt-dance before
your fiancée.... You do me the greatest service
when you point out to me where my place is.
Schön—[Sardonically.] For you with your
origin it’s incomparable luck to still have the chance
of appearing before respectable people!
Lulu—Even when my shamelessness makes them
not know where to look.
Schön—Nonsense!—Shamelessness?—Don’t make
a necessity of virtue! Your shamelessness is what
balances your every step with gold. One cries
“bravo,” another “fie”—it’s all the same to you!
Can you wish for a more brilliant triumph than
when a respectable girl can hardly be kept in the
box? Has your life any other aim? As long as
you still have a spark of self-respect, you are no
perfect dancer. The more terribly you make people
shudder, the higher you stand in your profession!
Lulu—And it is absolutely indifferent to me what
they think of me. I don’t, in the least, want to be
any better than I am. I’m content with myself.
Schön—[In moral indignation.] That is your
true nature. That’s straight!—Corruption!
[190]
Lulu—I wouldn’t have known that I had had a
spark of self-respect⁠——
Schön—[Suddenly distrustful.] No harlequinading⁠——
Lulu—O Lord—I know very well what I’d have
become if you hadn’t saved me from it.
Schön—Are you anything different then to-day?—heh?
Lulu—God be thanked, no!
Schön—Just so!
Lulu—[Laughs.] And how awfully glad of it
I am!
Schön—[Spits.] Will you dance now?
Lulu—In anything, before anyone!
Schön—Then down to the stage!
Lulu—[Begging like a child.] Just a minute
more! Please! I can’t stand up straight yet.
They’ll ring.
Schön—You have become what you are in spite
of everything I sacrificed for your education and
your welfare.
Lulu—Had you overrated your ennobling influence?
Schön—Spare me your witticisms.
Lulu—The Prince was here.
Schön—Well?
Lulu—He takes me with him to Africa.
Schön—Africa?
Lulu—Why not? Didn’t you make me a dancer
just so that someone might come and take me away
with him?
[191]
Schön—But not to Africa, though!
Lulu—Then why didn’t you calmly let me fall in
a faint, and mutely thank the Lord for it?
Schön—Because, more’s the pity, I had no reason
for believing in your faint!
Lulu—[Making fun of him.] You couldn’t bear
it any longer out front there?
Schön—Because I had to bring home to you what
you are and to whom you are not to look up.
Lulu—You were afraid, though, that my legs
might possibly have been really injured?
Schön—I know too well you are indestructible.
Lulu—So you know that?
Schön—[Bursting out.] Don’t look at me so
impudently!
Lulu—No one is keeping you here.
Schön—I’m going as soon as the bell rings.
Lulu—As soon as you have the energy! Where
is your energy? You have been engaged three years.
Why don’t you marry? You recognize no obstacles.
Why do you try to put the blame on me? You
ordered me to marry Dr. Goll: I forced Dr. Goll
to marry me. You ordered me to marry the painter:
I made the best of a bad bargain. Artists are your
creatures, princes your protégés. Why don’t you
marry?
Schön—[Raging.] Do you imagine you stand in
the way?
Lulu—[From here to the end of the act triumphant.]
If you knew how happy your rage is making
me! How proud I am that you take every means to
[192]
humble me! You push me down as low—as low as
a woman can be debased to, for then, you hope, you
can sooner get over me. But you have suffered unspeakably
yourself from everything you said just
now to me. I see it in your eyes. Already you are
near the end of your composure. Go! For your
innocent fiancée’s sake, leave me alone! One minute
more and your mood will change, and then you’ll
make a scene with me of another kind, that you can’t
answer for now.
Schön—I fear you no longer.
Lulu—Me? Fear yourself! I do not need you.
I beg you to go! Don’t give me the blame. You
know that I don’t need to faint to destroy your
future. You have unlimited confidence in my honorableness.
You believe not only that I’m an
ensnaring daughter of Eve; you believe, too, that
I’m a very good-natured creature. I am neither the
one nor the other. The bad thing for you is that you
think I am.
Schön—[Desperate.] Leave my thoughts alone!
You have two husbands under the sod. Take the
Prince, dance him into the ground. I am through
with you. I know where the angel in you leaves off
and the devil begins. If I take the world as it’s made,
the Creator must bear the responsibility, not I! To
me life is not an amusement!
Lulu—And, therefore, you make claims upon life
greater than anyone can make.... Tell me, who
of us two is more full of claims and demands, you
or I?
[193]
Schön—Be silent! I don’t know how or what
I think. When I hear you, I don’t think any more.
In a week I’ll be married. I conjure you, by the
angel that is in you, during that time come no more
to my sight!
Lulu—I will lock my doors.
Schön—Go on and boast! God knows that since
I began wrestling with the world and with life I have
cursed no one like you!
Lulu—That comes from my lowly origin.
Schön—From your depravity!
Lulu—With a thousand pleasures I take the blame
on myself! You must feel clean now; you must think
yourself a model of austerity now, a paragon of
unflinching principle—or else you can’t marry the
child at all in her boundless inexperience⁠——
Schön—Do you want me to grab you and⁠——
Lulu—Yes! Yes! What must I say to make
you? Not for the world now would I exchange
with the innocent child! Besides, the girl loves you
as no woman has ever loved you yet!
Schön—Silence, beast! Silence!
Lulu—Marry her—and then she’ll dance in her
childish wretchedness before my eyes, instead of
I before hers!
Schön—[Raising his fists.] God forgive me⁠——
Lulu—Strike me! Where is your riding-whip?
Strike me on the legs⁠——
Schön—[Grasping his temples.] Away, away!
[Rushes to the door, recollects himself, turns
[194]
around.] Can I go before the girl now, this way?
Home!—If I could only slip out of the world!
Lulu—Be a man! Look yourself in the face
once:—you have no trace of a conscience; you shrink
back from no wickedness; in the most cold-blooded
way you are meaning to make the girl that loves
you unhappy. You conquer half the world; you do
what you please;—and you know as well as I
that⁠——
Schön—[Sunk in the chair, right centre, utterly
exhausted.] Stop.
Lulu—That you are too weak—to tear yourself
away from me.
Schön—[Groaning.] Oh! Oh! You make me
weep.
Lulu—This moment makes me I cannot tell you
how glad.
Schön—My age! My position!
Lulu—He cries like a child—the terrible man
of might. Now go so to your bride and tell her
what kind of a girl I am at heart—not a bit jealous!
Schön—[Sobbing.] The child! The innocent
child!
Lulu—How can the incarnate devil get so weak
all of a sudden!——But now go, please. You are
nothing more now to me.
Schön—I cannot go to her.
Lulu—Out with you. Come to me again when
you have got back your strength.
Schön—Tell me in God’s name what I must do.
[195]
Lulu—[Gets up; her cloak remains on the chair.
Shoving aside the costumes on the centre table.]
Here is writing-paper⁠——
Schön—I can’t write....
Lulu—[Upright behind him, her arm on the back
of his chair.] Write! “My dear Countess....”
Schön—[Hesitating.] I call her Adelheid....
Lulu—[With emphasis.] “My dear Countess....”
Schön—My sentence of death! [He writes.]
Lulu—“Take back your promise. I cannot
reconcile it with my conscience——” [Schön drops
the pen and glances up at her entreatingly.] Write
“conscience”! “—to fetter you to my unhappy
lot....”
Schön—[Writing.] You are right. You are
right.
Lulu—“I give you my word that I am unworthy
of your love——” [Schön turns round again.]
Write “love”! “These lines are the proof of it.
For three years I have tried to tear myself free; I
have not the strength. I am writing you at the side
of the woman who commands me. Forget me. Dr.
Ludwig Schön.”
Schön—[Groaning.] O God!
Lulu—[Half startled.] No, no O God! [With
emphasis.] “Dr. Ludwig Schön.” Postscript: “Do
not attempt to save me.”
Schön—[Having written to the end, quite collapses.]
Now—comes the—execution.
CURTAIN
[196]
Scene—A splendid hall in German Renaissance style,
with a heavy ceiling of carved oak. The lower
half of the walls of dark carved wood; the upper
half on both sides hung with faded Gobelins. At
rear, a curtained gallery from which, at right,
a monumental staircase descends to halfway
down stage. At centre, under the gallery, the
entrance-door, with twisted posts and pediment.
At left, a high and spacious fireplace with a
Chinese folding screen before it. Further down,
left, a French window onto a balcony with heavy
curtains, closed. Down right, door hung with
Genoese velvet. Near it, a broad ottoman, with
an arm-chair on its left. Behind, near the foot
of the stairs, Lulu’s Pierrot-picture on a decorative
stand and in a gold frame made to look
antique. In the centre of the hall, down-stage,
a heavy square table, with three high-backed upholstered
chairs round it and a vase of white
flowers on it.
Countess Geschwitz sits on the ottoman, in
a soldier-like, fur-trimmed waist, high, upstanding
collar, enormous cufflinks, a veil over her
face, and her hands clasped convulsively in her
muff. Schön stands down right. Lulu, in a
big-flowered morning-dress, her hair in a simple
[197]
knot in a golden circlet, sits in the arm-chair
left of the ottoman.
Geschwitz—[To Lulu.] You can’t think how
glad I shall be to see you at our lady artists’ ball.
Schön—Is there no sort of possibility of a person
like me smuggling in?
Geschwitz—It would be high treason if any of us
lent herself to such an intrigue.
Schön—[Crossing to the centre table, behind the
ottoman.] The glorious flowers!
Lulu—Fräulein von Geschwitz brought me those.
Geschwitz—Don’t mention it.—Oh, you’ll be in
man’s costume, won’t you?
Lulu—Do you think that becomes me?
Geschwitz—You’re a dream here. [Signifying
the picture.]
Lulu—My husband doesn’t like it.
Geschwitz—Is it by a local man?
Lulu—You will hardly have known him.
Geschwitz—No longer living?
Schön—[Down left, with a deep voice.] He had
enough.
Lulu—You’re in bad temper. [Schön controls
himself.]
Geschwitz—[Getting up.] I must go, Mrs.
Schön. I can’t stay any longer. This evening we
have life-class, and I have still so much to get ready
for the ball. Good-bye, Dr. Schön. [Exit, up-stage.
Lulu accompanies her. Schön looks around
him.]
[198]
Schön—Pure Augean stable. That, the end of
my life. Show me one corner that’s still clean! The
pest in the house. The poorest day-laborer has his
tidy nest. Thirty years’ work, and this my family
circle, the home of my—— [Glancing round.]
God knows who is overhearing me again now!
[Draws a revolver from his breast pocket.] Man is,
indeed, uncertain of his life! [The cocked revolver
in his right hand, he goes left and speaks at the closed
window-curtains.] That, my family circle! The
fellow still has courage! Shall I not rather shoot
myself in the head? Against deadly enemies one
fights, but the—— [Throws up the curtains, but
finds no one hidden behind them.] The dirt—the
dirt.... [Shakes his head and crosses right.] Insanity
has already conquered my reason, or else—exceptions
prove the rule! [Hearing Lulu coming he
puts the revolver back in his pocket. Lulu comes
down to him.]
Lulu—Couldn’t you get away for this afternoon?
Schön—Just what did that Countess want?
Lulu—I don’t know. She wants to paint me.
Schön—Misfortune in human guise, paying her
respects!
Lulu—Couldn’t you get away, then? I would
so like to drive through the grounds with you.
Schön—Just the day when I must be at the
Exchange. You know that I’m not free to-day. All
my property is drifting on the waves.
Lulu—I’d sooner be dead and buried than let
my life be embittered so by my property.
[199]
Schön—Who takes life lightly does not take death
hard.
Lulu—As a child I always had the most horrible
fear of death.
Schön—That is just why I married you.
Lulu—[With her arms round his neck.] You’re
in bad humor. You invent too many worries. For
weeks and months I’ve seen nothing of you.
Schön—[Stroking her hair.] Your light-heartedness
should cheer up my old days.
Lulu—Indeed, you didn’t marry me at all.
Schön—Whom else did I marry then?
Lulu—I married you!
Schön—How does that alter anything?
Lulu—I was always afraid it would alter a great
deal.
Schön—It has, indeed, crushed a great deal underfoot.
Lulu—But not one thing, praise God!
Schön—Of that I should be covetous.
Lulu—Your love for me. [Schön’s face twitches,
he signs to her to go out in front of him. Both
exeunt lower right. Countess Geschwitz cautiously
opens the rear door, ventures forth, and listens.
Hearing voices approaching in the gallery above
her, she starts suddenly.]
Geschwitz—Oh, dear, there’s somebody——[Hides
behind the fire-screen.]
Schigolch—[Steps out from the curtains onto
the stairs, turns back.] Has the youngster left his
heart behind him in the Nightlight Café?
[200]
Rodrigo—[Between the curtains.] He is still too
small for the great world, and can’t walk so far on
foot yet. [He disappears.]
Schigolch—[Coming down the stairs.] God be
thanked we’re home again at last! What damned
skunk has waxed the stairs again? If I have to have
my joints set in plaster again before being called
home, she can just stick me up between the palms
here and present me to her relations as the Venus
de’ Medici. Nothing but steep rocks and stumbling
blocks!
Rodrigo—[Comes down the stairs, carrying
Hugenberg in his arms.] This thing has a royal
police-captain for a father and not as much spunk
in his body as the raggedest hobo!
Hugenberg—If there was nothing more to it than
life and death, then you’d soon learn to know me!
Rodrigo—Even with his lover’s woe, little brother
don’t weigh more than sixty kilos. On the truth
o’ that I’ll let ’em hang me any time.
Schigolch—Throw him up to the ceiling and
catch him by the feet. That’ll snap his young blood
into the proper fizz right from the start.
Hugenberg—[Kicking his legs.] Hooray, hooray,
I shall be expelled from school!
Rodrigo—[Setting him down at the foot of the
stairs.] You’ve never been to any sensible school
yet.
Schigolch—Here many a man has won his spurs
before you. Only, no timidity! First, I’ll set before
[201]
you a drop of what can’t be had anywhere for money.
[Opens a cupboard under the stairs.]
Hugenberg—Now if she doesn’t come dancing in
on the instant, I’ll wallop you two so you’ll still rub
your tails in the hereafter.
Rodrigo—[Seated left of the table.] The strongest
man in the world little brother will wallop! Let
mama put long trousers on you first. [Hugenberg
sits opposite him.]
Hugenberg—I’d rather you lent me your mustache.
Rodrigo—Maybe you want her to throw you out
of the door straight off?
Hugenberg—If I only knew now what the devil
I was going to say to her!
Rodrigo—That she knows best herself.
Schigolch—[Putting two bottles and three
glasses on the table.] I started in on one of them
yesterday. [Fills the glasses.]
Rodrigo—[Guarding Hugenberg’s.] Don’t give
him too much, or we’ll both have to pay for it.
Schigolch—[Supporting himself with both hands
on the table-top.] Will the gentlemen smoke?
Hugenberg—[Opening his cigar-case.] Havana-imported!
Rodrigo—[Helping himself.] From papa police-captain?
Schigolch—[Sitting.] Everything in the house
is mine. You only need to ask.
Hugenberg—I made a poem to her yesterday.
Rodrigo—What did you make to her?
[202]
Schigolch—What did he make to her?
Hugenberg—A poem.
Rodrigo—[To Schigolch.] A poem.
Schigolch—He’s promised me a dollar if I can
spy out where he can meet her alone.
Hugenberg—Just who does live here?
Rodrigo—Here we live!
Schigolch—Jour fix—every stock-market day!
Our health. [They clink.]
Hugenberg—Should I read it to her first, maybe?
Schigolch—[To Rodrigo.] What’s he mean?
Rodrigo—His poem. He’d like to stretch her out
and torture her a little first.
Schigolch—[Staring at Hugenberg.] His eyes!
His eyes!
Rodrigo—His eyes, yes. They’ve robbed her of
sleep for a week.
Schigolch—[To Rodrigo.] You can have yourself
pickled.
Rodrigo—We can both have ourselves pickled!
Our health, gossip Death!
Schigolch—[Clinking with him.] Health, jack-in-the-box!
If it’s still better later on, I’m ready
for departure at any moment; but—but—— [Lulu
enters right, in an elegant Parisian ball-dress, much
décolleté, with flowers in breast and hair.]
Lulu—But children, children, I expect company!
Schigolch—But I can tell you what, those things
must cost something over there! [Hugenberg has
risen. Lulu sits on the arm of his chair.]
[203]
Lulu—You’ve fallen into pretty company.—I
expect visitors, children!
Schigolch—I guess I’ve got to stick something
in there myself, too. [He searches among the flowers
on the table.]
Lulu—Do I look well?
Schigolch—What are those you’ve got there?
Lulu—Orchids. [Bending over Hugenberg.]
Smell.
Rodrigo—Do you expect Prince Escerny?
Lulu—[Shaking her head.] God forbid!
Rodrigo—So somebody else again——!
Lulu—The Prince has gone traveling.
Rodrigo—To put his kingdom up for auction?
Lulu—He’s exploring a fresh string of tribes in
the neighborhood of Africa. [Rises, hurries up the
stairs, and steps into the gallery.]
Rodrigo—[To Schigolch.] He really wanted
to marry her originally.
Schigolch—[Sticking a lily in his buttonhole.]
I, too, wanted to marry her originally.
Rodrigo—You wanted to marry her originally?
Schigolch—Didn’t you, too, want to marry her
originally?
Rodrigo—You bet I wanted to marry her originally!
Schigolch—Who has not wanted to marry her
originally!
Rodrigo—I could never have done better!
Schigolch—She hasn’t let anybody be sorry that
he didn’t marry her.
[204]
Rodrigo— ... Then she’s not your child?
Schigolch—Never occurs to her.
Hugenberg—What is her father’s name then?
Schigolch—She’s just boasted of me!
Hugenberg—What is her father’s name then?
Schigolch—What’s he say?
Rodrigo—What her father’s name is.
Schigolch—She never had one.
Lulu—[Comes down from the gallery and sits
again on Hugenberg’s chair-arm.] What have I
never had?
All Three—A father.
Lulu—Yes, sure—I’m a wonder-child. [To
Hugenberg.] How are you getting along with
your father? Contented?
Rodrigo—He smokes a respectable cigar, anyway,
the police-captain.
Schigolch—Have you locked up upstairs?
Lulu—There is the key.
Schigolch—Better have left it in the lock.
Lulu—Why?
Schigolch—So no one can unlock it from outside.
Rodrigo—Isn’t he at the stock-exchange?
Lulu—Oh, yes, but he suffers from persecution-mania.
Rodrigo—I take him by the feet, and yup!—there
he stays sticking to the roof.
Lulu—He hunts you into a mouse-hole with the
corner of his eye.
Rodrigo—What does he hunt? Who does he
hunt? [Baring his arm.] Just look at this biceps!
Lulu—Show me. [Goes left.]
[205]
Rodrigo—[Hitting himself on the muscle.]
Granite. Wrought-iron!
Lulu—[Feeling by turns Rodrigo’s arm and
her own.] If you only didn’t have such long
ears⁠——
Ferdinand—[Entering, rear centre.] Doctor⁠[8]
Schön!
Rodrigo—The rogue! [Jumps up, starts behind
the fire-screen, recoils.] God preserve me! [Hides,
lower left, behind the curtains.]
Schigolch—Give me the key! [Takes it and
drags himself up the stairs.]
Lulu—[Hugenberg having slid under the table.]
Show him in!
Hugenberg—[Under the front edge of the tablecloth,
listening; to himself.] If he doesn’t stay—we’ll
be alone.
Lulu—[Poking him with her toe.] Sh! [Hugenberg
disappears. Alva is shown in by Ferdinand.]
Alva—[In evening dress.] Methinks the matinée
will take place by burning lamplight. I’ve—— [Notices
Schigolch painfully climbing the stairs.]
What the —— is that?
Lulu—An old friend of your father’s.
Alva—Quite unknown to me.
Lulu—They were in the campaign together. He’s
awfully badly⁠——
Alva—Is my father here then?
Lulu—He drank a glass with him. He had to go
[206]
to the stock market. We’ll have lunch before we go,
won’t we?
Alva—When does it begin?
Lulu—After two. [Alva still follows Schigolch
with his eyes.] How do you like me? [Schigolch
disappears thru the gallery.]
Alva—Had I not better be silent to you on that
point?
Lulu—I only mean my appearance.
Alva—Your dressmaker manifestly knows you
better than I—may permit myself to know you.
Lulu—When I saw myself in the glass I could
have wished to be a man—my man!...
Alva—You seem to envy your man the delight
you offer to him. [Lulu is at the right, Alva at
the left, of the centre table. He regards her with
shy satisfaction. Ferdinand enters, rear, covers
the table and lays two plates, etc., a bottle of Pommery,
and hors d’œuvres.] Have you a toothache?
Lulu—[Across to Alva.] Don’t.
Ferdinand—Doctor Schön...?
Alva—He seems so puckered-up and tearful to-day.
Ferdinand—[Thru his teeth.] One is only a
man after all. [Exit.]
Lulu—[When both are seated.] What I always
think most highly of in you is your firmness of character.
You’re so perfectly sure of yourself. Even
when you must have been afraid of falling out with
your father on my account, you always stood up
for me like a brother just the same.
[207]
Alva—Let’s drop that. It’s just my fate—[Moves
to lift up the tablecloth in front.]
Lulu—[Quickly.] That was me.
Alva—Impossible!—It’s just my fate, with the
most trivial thoughts always to attain the best.
Lulu—You deceive yourself if you make yourself
out worse than you are.
Alva—Why do you flatter me so? It is true that
perhaps there is no man living, so bad as I—who
has brought about so much good.
Lulu—In any case you’re the only man in the
world who’s protected me without lowering me in my
own eyes!
Alva—Do you think that so easy? [Schön appears
in the gallery cautiously parting the hangings
between the middle pillars. He starts, and whispers,
“My own son!”] With gifts from God like
yours, one turns those around one to criminals without
ever dreaming of it. I, too, am only flesh and
blood, and if we hadn’t grown up with each other
like brother and sister⁠——
Lulu—And that’s why I only give myself to you
alone quite without reserve. From you I have nothing
to fear.
Alva—I assure you there are moments when one
expects to see one’s whole inner self cave in. The
more self-suppression a man loads onto himself, the
easier he breaks down. Nothing will save him from
it except——[Stops to look under the table.]
Lulu—[Quickly.] What are you looking for?
Alva—I conjure you, let me keep my confession
[208]
of faith to myself! As an inviolable sanctity you
were more to me than with all your gifts you could
be to anyone else in your life!
Lulu—How extraordinarily different your mind
is, on that, from your father’s! [Ferdinand enters,
rear, changes the plates and serves broiled chicken
with salad.]
Alva—[To him.] Are you sick?
Lulu—[To Alva.] Let him be!
Alva—He’s trembling as if he had fever.
Ferdinand—I am not yet so used to waiting....
Alva—You must have something prescribed for
you.
Ferdinand—[Thru his teeth.] I’m a coachman
usually——[Exit.]
Schön—[Whispering from the gallery.] So, he
too. [Seats himself behind the rail, able to cover
himself with the hangings.]
Lulu—What sort of moments are those of which
you spoke, where one expects to see his whole inner
self tumble in?
Alva—I didn’t want to speak of them. I
should not like to lose, in joking over a glass of
champagne, what has been my highest happiness for
ten years.
Lulu—I have hurt you. I don’t want to begin
on that again.
Alva—Do you promise me that for always?
Lulu—My hand on it. [Gives him her hand
across the table. Alva takes it hesitatingly, grips
it in his, and presses it long and ardently to his lips.]
[209]
What are you doing? [Rodrigo sticks his head out
from the curtains, left. Lulu darts an angry look
at him across Alva, and he draws back.]
Schön—[Whispering from the gallery.] And
there is still another!
Alva—[Holding the hand.] A soul—that in the
hereafter will rub the sleep out of its eyes.... Oh,
this hand....
Lulu—[Innocently.] What do you find in it?...
Alva—An arm....
Lulu—What do you find in it?...
Alva—A body....
Lulu—[Guilelessly.] What do you find in it?...
Alva—[Stirred up.] Mignon!
Lulu—[Wholly ingenuously.] What do you find
in it?...
Alva—[Passionately.] Mignon! Mignon!
Lulu—[Throws herself on the ottoman.] Don’t
look at me so—for God’s sake! Let us go before
it is too late. You’re an infamous wretch!
Alva—I told you, didn’t I, I was the basest villain....
Lulu—I see that!
Alva—I have no sense of honor, no pride....
Lulu—You think I am your equal!
Alva—You?—you are as heavenly high above me
as—as the sun is over the abyss! [Kneeling.] Destroy
me! I beg you, put an end to me! Put an
end to me!
Lulu—Do you love me then?
[210]
Alva—I will pay you with everything that was
mine!
Lulu—Do you love me?
Alva—Do you love me—Mignon?
Lulu—I? Not a soul.
Alva—I love you. [Hides his face in her lap.]
Lulu—[Both hands in his hair.] I poisoned
your mother—— [Rodrigo sticks his head out from
the curtains, left, sees Schön sitting in the gallery
and signs to him to watch Lulu and Alva. Schön
points his revolver at Rodrigo; Rodrigo signs to him
to point it at Alva. Schön cocks the revolver and
takes aim. Rodrigo draws back behind the curtains.
Lulu sees him draw back, sees Schön sitting in the
gallery, and gets up.] His father! [Schön rises,
lets the hangings fall before him. Alva remains
motionless on his knees. Pause.]
Schön—[A newspaper in his hand, takes Alva
by the shoulder.] Alva! [Alva gets up as though
drunk with sleep.] A revolution has broken out in
Paris.
Alva—To Paris ... let me go to Paris⁠——
Schön—Up in the office the editors are tearing
their hair. Not one of them knows what to write
about it. [He unfolds the paper and accompanies
Alva out, rear. Rodrigo rushes out from the curtains
toward the stairs.]
Lulu—[Barring his way.] You can’t get out
here.
Rodrigo—Let me through!
Lulu—You’ll run into his arms.
[211]
Rodrigo—He’ll shoot me thru the head!
Lulu—He’s coming.
Rodrigo—[Stumbling back.] Devil, death and
demons! [Lifts the tablecloth.]
Hugenberg—No room!
Rodrigo—Damned and done for! [Looks around
and hides in the doorway, right.]
Schön—[Comes in, centre; locks the door; and
goes, revolver in hand, to the window down left, of
which he throws up the curtains.] Where is he
gone?
Lulu—[On the lowest step.] Out.
Schön—Down over the balcony?
Lulu—He’s an acrobat.
Schön—That could not be foreseen. [Turning
against Lulu.] You who drag me thru the muck
of the streets to a tortured death!
Lulu—Why did you not bring me up better?
Schön—You destroying angel! You inexorable
fate!—To turn murderer or else to drown in filth;
to take ship like a fleeing convict, or hang myself
over the mire!—You joy of my old age! You hangman’s
noose!
Lulu—[In cold blood.] Oh, shut up, and kill
me!
Schön—Everything I possess I have made over
to you, and asked nothing but the respect that every
servant pays to my house. Your credit is exhausted!
Lulu—I can answer for my account for years
to come. [Coming forward from the stairs.] How
do you like my new gown?
[212]
Schön—Away with you, or my brains will crack
to-morrow and my son swim in his blood! You infect
me like an incurable pest in which I shall groan
away the rest of my life. I will cure myself! Do
you understand? [Pressing the revolver on her.]
This is your physic. Don’t break down; don’t
kneel! You yourself shall apply it. You or I—which
is it to be? [Lulu, her strength threatening
to desert her, has sunk down on the couch, turning
the revolver this way and that.]
Lulu—It doesn’t go off.
Schön—Do you still recall how I snatched you
out of the clutches of the police?
Lulu—You have great confidence⁠——
Schön—Because I’m not afraid of a street-girl?
Shall I guide your hand for you? Have you no
mercy towards yourself? [Lulu points the revolver
at him.] No false alarms! [Lulu fires a shot into
the ceiling. Rodrigo springs out of the portières,
up the stairs and away thru the gallery.] What
was that?
Lulu—[Innocently.] Nothing.
Schön—[Lifting the portières.] What flew out
of here?
Lulu—You’re suffering from persecution-mania.
Schön—Have you got still more men hidden here?
[Tearing the revolver from her.] Is yet another
man calling on you? [Going left.] I’ll regale your
men! [Throws up the window-curtains, flings the
fire-screen back, grabs Countess Geschwitz by the
collar and drags her forward.] Did you come down
the chimney?
[213]
Geschwitz—[In deadly terror, to Lulu.] Save
me from him!
Schön—[Shaking her.] Or are you, too, an acrobat?
Geschwitz—[Whimpering.] You hurt me.
Schön—[Shaking her.] Now you will have to
stay to dinner. [Drags her right, shoves her into
the next room and locks the door after her.] We
want no town-criers. [Sits next to Lulu and makes
her take the revolver again.] There’s still enough
for you in it. Look at me! I cannot assist the
coachman in my house to decorate my forehead for
me. Look at me! I pay my coachman. Look at
me! Am I doing the coachman a favor if I can’t
bear the vile stable-stench?
Lulu—Have the carriage got ready! Please!
We’re going to the opera.
Schön—We’re going to the devil! Now I am
coachman. [Turning the revolver in her hand from
himself to Lulu’s breast.] Do you believe that anyone,
abused as you have abused me, would hesitate
between an old age of slavish infamy and the merit
of freeing the world from you? [Holds her down
by the arm.] Come, get through. It shall be the
happiest remembrance of my life. Pull the trigger!
Lulu—You can get a divorce.
Schön—Only that was left! In order that to-morrow
the next man may find his pastime where
I have shuddered from pit to pit, suicide upon my
neck and you before me! You dare suggest that?
That part of my life I have poured into you, am I
[214]
to see it tossed before wild beasts? Do you see your
bed with the sacrifice—the victim—on it? The lad
is homesick for you. Did you let yourself be divorced?
You trod him under your feet, knocked out
his brains, caught up his blood in gold-pieces. I
let myself be divorced? Can one be divorced when
two people have grown into one another and half
the man must go too? [Reaching for the revolver.]
Give it here!
Lulu—Don’t!
Schön—I’ll spare you the trouble.
Lulu—[Tears herself loose, holding the revolver
down; in a determined, self-possessed tone.] If
men have killed themselves for my sake, that doesn’t
lower my value. You knew quite as well why you
made me your wife as I knew why I took you for
husband. You had deceived your best friends with
me; you could not well go on deceiving yourself with
me. If you bring me your old age in sacrifice, you
have had my whole youth in return. You understand
ten times better than I do which is the more
valuable. I have never in the world wished to seem
to be anything different from what I am taken for,
and I have never in the world been taken for anything
different from what I am. You want to force
me to fire a bullet into my heart. I’m not sixteen
any more, but to fire a bullet in my heart I am still
much too young!
Schön—[Pursuing her.] Down, murderess!
Down with you! To your knees, murderess!
[Crowding her to the foot of the stairs.] Down,
[215]
and never dare to stand again! [Raising his hand.
Lulu has sunk to her knees.] Pray to God, murderess,
that he give you strength. Sue to heaven
that strength for it may be lent you! [Hugenberg
jumps up from under the table, knocking a chair
aside, and screams “Help!” Schön whirls toward
him, turning his back to Lulu, who instantly fires
five shots into him and continues to pull the trigger.
Schön, tottering over, is caught by Hugenberg and
let down in the chair.]
Schön—And—there—is—one—more⁠——
Lulu—[Rushing to Schön.] All merciful——!
Schön—Out of my sight! Alva!
Lulu—[Kneeling.] The one man I loved!
Schön—Harlot! Murderess!—Alva! Alva!—Water!
Lulu—Water; he’s thirsty. [Fills a glass with
champagne and sets it to Schön’s lips. Alva comes
thru the gallery, down the stairs.]
Alva—Father! O God, my father!
Lulu—I shot him.
Hugenberg—She is innocent!
Schön—[To Alva.] You! It miscarried.
Alva—[Tries to lift him.] You must get to
bed; come.
Schön—Don’t take hold of me so! I’m drying
up. [Lulu comes with the champagne-cup; to her.]
You are still like yourself. [After drinking.]
Don’t let her escape. [To Alva.] You are the
next.
Alva—[To Hugenberg.] Help me carry him
to bed.
[216]
Schön—No, no, please, no. Wine, murderess⁠——
Alva—[To Hugenberg.] Take hold of him on
that side. [Pointing right.] Into the bedroom.
[They lift Schön upright and lead him right. Lulu
stays near the table, the glass in her hand.]
Schön—[Groaning.] O God! O God! O God!
[Alva finds the door locked, turns the key and opens
it. Countess Geschwitz steps out. Schön at the
sight of her straightens up, stiffly.] The Devil.
[He falls backward onto the carpet. Lulu throws
herself down, takes his head in her lap, and kisses
him.]
Lulu—He has got thru. [Gets up and starts
toward the stairs.]
Alva—Don’t stir!
Geschwitz—I thought it was you.
Lulu—[Throwing herself before Alva.] You
can’t give me up to the law! It is my head that is
struck off. I shot him because he was about to shoot
me. I have loved nobody in the world but him!
Alva, demand what you will, only don’t let me fall
into the hands of justice. Take pity on me. I am
still young. I will be true to you as long as I live.
I will be wholly yours, yours only! Look at me,
Alva. Man, look at me! Look at me! [Knocking
on the door outside.]
Alva—The police. [Goes to open it.]
Hugenberg—I shall be expelled from school.
CURTAIN
[8] That is, since Act III Alva has won his Ph.D.
[217]
(Die Büchse der Pandora)
A Tragedy in Three Acts
[219]
Lulu
Dr. Alva Schön, Ph.D., a writer
Schigolch
Rodrigo Quast, acrobat
Alfred Hugenberg, escaped from a reform-school
Countess Geschwitz
The first act takes place in Germany, the second in
France, the third in England.
[221]
Scene—The hall of “Earth-Spirit,” Act IV,
feebly lighted by an oil lamp on the centre table.
Even this is dimmed by a heavy shade. Lulu’s
picture is gone from the easel, which still stands
by the foot of the stairs. The fire-screen and
the chair by the ottoman are gone too. Down
left is a small tea-table, with a coffee-pot and a
cup of black coffee on it, and an arm-chair
next it.
In this chair, deep in cushions, with a plaid
shawl over her knees, sits Countess Geschwitz
in a tight black dress. Rodrigo, clad as a servant,
sits on the ottoman. At the rear, Alva
Schön is walking up and down before the entrance
door.
Rodrigo—He lets people wait for him as if he
were a concert conductor!
Geschwitz—I beg of you, don’t speak!
Rodrigo—Hold my tongue? with a head as full
of thoughts as mine is!—I absolutely can’t believe
she’s changed so awfully much to her advantage
there!
Geschwitz—She is more glorious to look at than
I have ever seen her!
Rodrigo—God preserve me from founding my life-happiness
upon your taste and judgment! If the
[222]
disease has hit her as it has you, I’m smashed and
thru! You’re leaving the contagious ward like a
rubber-lady who’s had an accident and taken to
hunger-striking. You can scarcely blow your nose
any more. First you need a quarter-hour to sort
your fingers, and then you have to be mighty careful
not to break off the tip.
Geschwitz—What puts us under the ground
gives her health and strength again.
Rodrigo—That’s all right and fine enough. But
I don’t think I’ll be travelling off with her this evening.
Geschwitz—You will let your bride journey all
alone, after all?
Rodrigo—In the first place, the old fellow’s going
with her to protect her in case anything serious——My
escort could only be suspicious. And secondly,
I must wait here till my costumes are ready. I’ll
get across the frontier soon enough all right,—and
I hope in the meantime she’ll put on a little embonpoint,
too. Then we’ll get married, provided I can
present her before a respectable public. I love the
practical in a woman: what theories they make up
for themselves are all the same to me. Aren’t they
to you too, Doctor?
Alva—I haven’t heard what you were saying.
Rodrigo—I’d never have got my person mixed
up in this plot at all if she hadn’t kept tickling my
bare pate, before her sentence. If only she doesn’t
start exercising again too hard the moment she’s
out of Germany! I’d like best to take her to London
[223]
for six months, and let her fill up on plum-cakes. In
London one expands just from the sea air. And
then, too, in London one doesn’t feel with every
swallow of beer as if the hand of fate were at one’s
throat.
Alva—I’ve been asking myself for a week now
whether a person who’d been sentenced to prison
could still be made to go as the chief figure in a modern
drama.
Geschwitz—If the man would only come, now!
Rodrigo—I’ve still got to redeem my properties
out of the pawn-shop here, too. Six hundred kilos
of the best iron. The baggage-rate on ’em is always
three times as much as my own ticket, so that the
whole junket isn’t worth a trousers button. When
I went into the pawn-shop with ’em, dripping with
sweat, they asked me if the things were genuine!—I’d
have really done better to have had the costumes
made abroad. In Paris, for instance, they see at the
first glance where one’s best points are, and bravely
lay them bare. But you can’t learn that sitting
cross-legged; it’s got to be studied on classically
shaped people. In this country they’re as scared
of naked skin as they are abroad of dynamite bombs.
Two years ago at the Alhambra Theater I was stuck
for a fifty-marks fine because people could see I had
a few hairs on my chest, not enough to make a respectable
toothbrush! But the Fine Arts Minister
opined that the little schoolgirls might lose their
joy in knitting stockings because of it; and since
then I have myself shaved once a month.
[224]
Alva—If I didn’t need every bit of my creative
power now for the “World-Conqueror,” I might like
to test the problem and see what could be done with
it. That’s the curse of our young literature: we’re
so much too literary. We know only such questions
and problems as come up among writers and cultured
people. We cannot see beyond the limits of our own
professional interests. In order to get back on the
trail of a great and powerful art we must live as
much as possible among men who’ve never read a
book in their lives, who are moved by the simplest
animal instincts in all they do. I’ve tried already,
with all my might, to work according to those principles—in
my “Earth-Spirit.” The woman who was
my model for the chief figure in that, breathes to-day—and
has for a year—behind barred windows; and
on that account for some incomprehensible reason
the play was only brought to performance by the
Society for Free Literature. As long as my father
was alive, all the stages of Germany stood open to
my creations. That has been vastly changed.
Rodrigo—I’ve had a pair of tights made of the
tenderest blue-green. If they don’t make a success
abroad, I’ll sell mouse-traps! The trunks are
so delicate I can’t sit on the edge of a table in ’em.
The only thing that will disturb the good impression
is my awful bald head, which I owe to my active
participation in this great conspiracy. To lie in
the hospital in perfect health for three months would
make a fat pig of the most run-down old hobo. Since
coming out I’ve fed on nothing but Karlsbad pills.
[225]
Day and night I have orchestra rehearsals in my
intestines. I’ll be so washed out before I get across
the frontier that I won’t be able to lift a bottle-cork.
Geschwitz—How the attendants in the hospital
got out of her way yesterday! That was a refreshing
sight. The garden was still as the grave: in
the loveliest noon sunlight the convalescents didn’t
venture out of doors. Away back by the contagious
ward she stepped out under the mulberry trees and
swayed on her ankles on the gravel. The doorkeeper
had recognized me, and a young doctor who
met me in the corridor shrunk up as tho a revolver
shot had struck him. The Sisters vanished into the
big rooms or stayed stuck against the walls. When
I came back there was not a soul to be seen in the
garden or at the gate. No better chance could have
been found, if we had had the curséd passports. And
now the fellow says he isn’t going with her!
Rodrigo—I understand the poor hospital-brothers.
One has a bad foot and another has a swollen
cheek, and there bobs up in the midst of them the
incarnate death-insurance-agentess! In the Hall of
the Knights, as the blessed division was called from
which I organized my spying, when the news got
around there that Sister Theophila had departed this
life, not one of the fellows could be kept in bed.
They scrambled up to the window-bars, if they had
to drag their pains along with them by the hundredweight.
I never heard such swearing in my life!
[226]
Alva—Allow me, Fräulein von Geschwitz, to come
back to my proposition once more. Tho she shot
my father in this very room, still I can see in the
murder, as in the punishment, nothing but a horrible
misfortune that has befallen her; nor do I think
that my father, if he had come through alive, would
have withdrawn his support from her entirely.
Whether your plan for freeing her will succeed still
seems to me very doubtful, tho I wouldn’t like to
discourage you; but I can find no words to express
the admiration with which your self-sacrifice, your
energy, your superhuman scorn of death, inspires
me. I don’t believe any man ever risked so much
for a woman, let alone for a friend. I am not aware,
Fräulein von Geschwitz, how rich you are, but the
outlay for what you have accomplished must have
shattered your fortune. May I venture to offer you
a loan of 20,000 marks—which I should have no
trouble raising for you in cash?
Geschwitz—How we did rejoice when Sister
Theophila was really dead! From that day on we
were free from supervision. We changed our beds
as we liked. I had done my hair like hers, and copied
every tone of her voice. When the professor
came he called her “gnädiges Fräulein” and said
to me, “It’s better living here than in prison!”...
When the Sister suddenly was missing, we looked at
each other in suspense: we had both been sick five
days: now was the deciding moment. Next morning
came the assistant.—“How is Sister Theophila?”—“Dead!”—We
communicated behind his back, and
[227]
when he had gone we sank in each other’s arms:
“God be thanked! God be thanked!”—What pains
it cost me to keep my darling from betraying how
well she already was! “You have nine years of
prison before you,” I cried to her early and late.
And now they probably wouldn’t let her stay in the
contagious ward three days more!
Rodrigo—I lay in the hospital full three months
to spy out the ground, after toilfully peddling together
the qualities necessary for such a long stay.
Now I act the valet here with you, Dr. Schön, so
that no strange servants may come into the house.
Where is the bridegroom who’s ever done so much
for his bride? My fortune has also been shattered.
Alva—When you succeed in developing her into
a respectable artiste you will have put the world in
debt to you. With the temperament and the beauty
that she has to give out from the inmost depths of
her nature she can make the most blasé public hold
its breath. And then, too, she will be protected, by
acting passion, from a second time becoming a
criminal in reality.
Rodrigo—I’ll soon drive her kiddishness out of
her!
Geschwitz—There he comes! [Steps louden in
the gallery. Then the curtains part at the head of
the stairs and Schigolch in a long black coat with
a white sun-shade in his right hand comes down.
Thruout the play his speech is interrupted with frequent
yawns.]
[228]
Schigolch—Confound the darkness! Outdoors
the sun burns your eyes out.
Geschwitz—[Wearily unwrapping herself.] I’m
coming!
Rodrigo—Her ladyship has seen no daylight for
three days. We live here like in a snuff-box.
Schigolch—Since nine o’clock this morning I’ve
been round to all the old-clothes-men. Three brand-new
trunks stuffed full of old trousers I’ve expressed
to Buenos Aires via Bremerhaven. My legs are
dangling on me like the tongue of a bell. It’s going
to be a different life for me from now on!
Rodrigo—Where are you going to get off to-morrow
morning?
Schigolch—I hope not straight into Ox-butter
Hotel again!
Rodrigo—I can tell you a fine hotel. I lived there
with a lady lion-tamer. The people were born in
Berlin.
Geschwitz—[Upright in the arm-chair.] Come
and help me!
Rodrigo—[Hurries to her and supports her.]
And you’ll be safer from the police there than on a
high tight-rope!
Geschwitz—He means to let you go with her
alone this afternoon.
Schigolch—Maybe he’s still suffering from his
chilblains!
Rodrigo—Do you want me to start my new engagement
in bath-robe and slippers?
Schigolch—Hm—Sister Theophila wouldn’t
[229]
have gone to heaven so promptly either, if she hadn’t
felt so affectionate towards our patient.
Rodrigo—When one has to serve thru a honeymoon
with her, she’ll have a very different value.
Anyway, it can’t hurt her if she gets a little fresh
air beforehand.
Alva—[A pocketbook in his hand, to Geschwitz,
who is leaning on a chair-back by the centre table.]
This holds 10,000 marks.
Geschwitz—Thank you, no.
Alva—Please take it.
Geschwitz—[To Schigolch.] Come along, at
last!
Schigolch—Patience, Fräulein. It’s only a
stone’s throw across Hospital Street. I’ll be here
with her in five minutes.
Alva—You’re bringing her here?
Schigolch—I’m bringing her here. Or do you
fear for your health?
Alva—You see that I fear nothing.
Rodrigo—According to the latest wire, the doctor
is on his way to Constantinople to have his “Earth-Spirit”
produced before the Sultan by harem-ladies
and eunuchs.
Alva—[Opening the centre door under the gallery.]
It’s shorter for you thru here. [Exeunt
Schigolch and Countess Geschwitz. Alva locks
the door.]
Rodrigo—You were going to give more money to
the crazy skyrocket!
Alva—What has that to do with you?
[230]
Rodrigo—I get paid like a lamp-lighter, tho I
had to demoralize all the Sisters in the hospital.
Then came the assistants’ and the doctors’ turn, and
then⁠——
Alva—Will you seriously inform me that the medical
professors let themselves be influenced by you?
Rodrigo—With the money those gentlemen cost
me I could become President of the United States!
Alva—But Fräulein von Geschwitz has reimbursed
you for every penny that you spent. So
much I know, and you’re still getting five hundred
marks a month from her besides. It is often pretty
hard to believe in your love for the unhappy murderess.
When I asked Fräulein von Geschwitz just
now to accept my help, it certainly was not done to
stir up your insatiable avarice. The admiration
which I have learnt to have for Fräulein von
Geschwitz in this affair, I am far from feeling
towards you. It is not at all clear to me what
claims of any kind you can make upon me. That
you chanced to be present at the murder of my
father has not yet created the slightest bond of relationship
between you and me. On the contrary, I
am firmly convinced that if the heroic undertaking
of Countess Geschwitz had not come your way you
would be lying somewhere to-day, without a penny,
drunken in the gutter.
Rodrigo—And do you know what would have become
of you if you hadn’t sold for two millions the
tuppenny paper your father ran? You’d have
hitched up with the stringiest sort of ballet-girl and
[231]
been to-day a stable-boy in the Humpelmeier Circus.
What work do you do? You’ve written a
drama of horrors in which my bride’s calves are the
two chief figures and which no high-class theater will
produce. You walking pajamas! You fresh ragbag,
you! Two years ago I balanced two saddled
cavalry-horses on this chest. How that’ll go now,
after this [clasping his bald head], is a question sure
enough. The foreign girls will get a fine idea of
German art when they see the sweat come beading
thru my tights at every fresh kilo-weight! I shall
make the whole auditorium stink with my exhalations!
Alva—You’re weak as a dish-clout!
Rodrigo—Would to God you were right! or did
you perhaps intend to insult me? If so, I’ll set the
tip of my toe to your jaw so that your tongue’ll
crawl along the carpet over there!
Alva—Try it! [Steps and voices outside.]
Who is that...?
Rodrigo—You can thank God that I have no public
here before me!
Alva—Who can that be!
Rodrigo—That is my beloved. It’s a full year
now since we’ve seen each other.
Alva—But how should they be back already!
Who can be coming there? I expect no one.
Rodrigo—Oh, the devil, unlock it!
Alva—Hide yourself!
Rodrigo—I’ll get behind the portières. I’ve stood
there once before, a year ago. [Disappears, right.
[232]Alva opens the rear door, whereupon Alfred Hugenberg
enters, hat in hand.]
Alva—With whom have I—.... You? Aren’t
you——?
Hugenberg—Alfred Hugenberg.
Alva—What can I do for you?
Hugenberg—I’ve come from Münsterburg. I
ran away this morning.
Alva—My eyes are bad. I am forced to keep the
blinds closed.
Hugenberg—I need your help. You will not refuse
me. I’ve got a plan ready.—Can anyone
hear us?
Alva—What do you mean? What sort of a
plan?
Hugenberg—Are you alone?
Alva—Yes. What do you want to impart to me?
Hugenberg—I’ve had two plans already that I
let drop. What I shall tell you now has been worked
out to the last possible chance. If I had money I
should not confide it to you; I thought about that a
long time before coming.... Don’t you want to
let me explain my scheme to you?
Alva—Will you kindly tell me just what you are
talking about?
Hugenberg—She cannot possibly be so indifferent
to you that I must tell you that. The evidence
you gave the coroner helped her more than everything
the defending counsel said.
Alva—I beg to decline the supposition.
Hugenberg—You would say that; I understand
[233]
that, of course. But all the same you were her best
witness.
Alva—You were! You said my father was
about to force her to shoot herself.
Hugenberg—He was, too. But they didn’t believe
me. I wasn’t put on my oath.
Alva—Where have you come from now?
Hugenberg—From a reform-school I broke out
of this morning.
Alva—And what do you have in view?
Hugenberg—I’m trying to get into the confidence
of a turnkey.
Alva—What do you mean to live on?
Hugenberg—I’m living with a girl who’s had a
child by my father.
Alva—Who is your father?
Hugenberg—He’s a police captain. I know the
prison without ever having been inside it; and nobody
in it will recognize me as I am now. But I
don’t count on that at all. I know an iron ladder
by which one can get from the first court to the roof
and thru an opening there into the attic. There’s
no way up to it from inside. But in all five wings
boards and laths and great heaps of shavings are
lying under the roofs, and I’ll drag them all together
in the middle and set fire to them. My pockets
are full of matches and all the things used to
make fires.
Alva—But then you’ll burn up there!
Hugenberg—Of course, if I’m not rescued. But
to get into the first court I must have the turnkey
[234]
in my power, and for that I need money. Not that
I mean to bribe him; that wouldn’t go. I must lend
him money to send his three children to the country,
and then at four o’clock in the morning when
the prisoners of respected families are discharged,
I’ll slip in the door. He’ll lock-up behind me and
ask me what I’m after, and I’ll ask him to let me
out again in the evening. And before it gets light,
I’m up in the attic.
Alva—How did you escape from the reform-school?
Hugenberg—Jumped out the window. I need
two hundred marks for the rascal to send his family
to the country.
Rodrigo—[Stepping out of the portières, right.]
Will the Herr Baron have coffee in the music-room
or on the veranda?
Hugenberg—How did that man come here? Out
of the same door! He jumped out of the same
door!
Alva—I’ve taken him into my service. He is dependable.
Hugenberg—[Grasping his temples.] Fool that
I am! Oh, fool!
Rodrigo—Oh, yah, we’ve seen each other here before!
Cut away now to your vice-mama. Your
kid brother might like to uncle his brothers and sisters.
Make your sir-papa the grandfather of his
children! You’re the only thing we’ve missed. If
you once get into my sight in the next two weeks,
I’ll beat your bean up for porridge.
[235]
Alva—Be quiet, you!
Hugenberg—I’m a fool!
Rodrigo—What do you want to do with your
fire? Don’t you know the lady’s been dead three
weeks?
Hugenberg—Did they cut off her head?
Rodrigo—No, she’s got that still. She was
mashed by the cholera.
Hugenberg—That is not true!
Rodrigo—What do you know about it! There,
read it: here! [Taking out a paper and pointing
to the place.] “The murderess of Dr. Schön....”
[Gives Hugenberg the paper. He reads:]
Hugenberg—“The murderess of Dr. Schön has
in some incomprehensible way fallen ill of the cholera
in prison.” It doesn’t say that she’s dead.
Rodrigo—Well, what else do you suppose she is?
She’s been lying in the churchyard three weeks.
Back in the left-hand corner behind the rubbish-heap
where the little crosses are with no names on
them, there she lies under the first one. You’ll know
the spot because the grass hasn’t grown on it. Hang
a tin wreath there, and then get back to your nursery-school
or I’ll denounce you to the police. I
know the female that beguiles her leisure hours with
you!
Hugenberg—[To Alva.] Is it true that she’s
dead?
Alva—Thank God, yes!—Please, do not keep me
here any longer. My doctor has forbidden me to
receive visitors.
[236]
Hugenberg—My future life means so little now!
I would gladly have given the last scrap of what life
is worth to me for her happiness. Heigh-ho! One
way or another I’ll sure go to the devil now!
Rodrigo—If you dare in any way to approach me
or the doctor here or my honorable friend Schigolch
too near, I’ll inform on you for intended arson. You
need three good years of prison to learn where not
to stick your fingers in! Now get out!
Hugenberg—Fool!
Rodrigo—Get out! [Throws him out the door.
Coming down.] I wonder you didn’t put your purse
at that rogue’s disposal, too!
Alva—I won’t stand your damned jabbering!
The boy’s little finger is worth more than all you!
Rodrigo—I’ve had enough of this Geschwitz’s
company! If my bride is to become a corporation
with limited liability, somebody else can go in ahead
of me. I propose to make a magnificent trapeze-artiste
out of her, and willingly risk my life to do
it. But then I’ll be master of the house, and will
myself indicate what cavaliers she is to receive!
Alva—The boy has what our age lacks: a hero-nature;
therefore, of course, he is going to ruin. Do
you remember how before sentence was passed he
jumped out of the witness-box and yelled at the justice:
“How do you know what would have become of
you if you’d had to run around the cafés barefoot
every night when you were ten years old?”
Rodrigo—If I could only have given him one in
the jaw for that right away! Thank God, there
[237]
are jails where scum like that gets some respect for
the law pounded into them.
Alva—One like him might have been my model
for my “World-conqueror.” For twenty years literature
has presented nothing but demi-men: men
who can beget no children and women who can bear
none. That’s called “The Modern Problem.”
Rodrigo—I’ve ordered a hippopotamus-whip two
inches thick. If that has no success with her, you
can fill my cranium with potato-soup. Be it love
or be it whipping, female flesh never inquires. Only
give it some amusement, and it stays firm and fresh.
She is now in her twentieth year, has been married
three times and has satisfied a gigantic horde of lovers,
and her heart’s desires are at last pretty plain.
But the man’s got to have the seven deadly sins on
his forehead, or she honors him not. If he looks as
if a dog-catcher had spat him out on the street,
then, with such women-folks, he needn’t be afraid of
a prince! I’ll rent a garage fifty feet high and break
her in there; and when she’s learnt the first diving-leap
without breaking her neck I’ll pull on a black
coat and not stir a finger the rest of my life. With
her practical equipment it costs a woman not half
the trouble to support her husband as the other way
round, if only the man looks after the mental work
for her, and doesn’t let the sense of the family go
to wreck.
Alva—I have learnt how to master humanity and
drive it in harness before me like a well-broken four-in-hand,—but
that boy sticks in my head. Really,
[238]
I can still take private lessons in the scorn of the
world from that schoolboy!
Rodrigo—She’ll just comfortably let her hide be
papered with thousand-mark bills! I’ll extract
salaries out of the directors with a centrifugal pump.
I know their kind. When they don’t need a man,
let him shine their shoes for them; but when they
must have an artiste they’ll cut her down from the
very gallows with their own hands and with the most
binding compliments.
Alva—In my circumstances there’s nothing left
in the world that I should fear—but death. Yet in
feelings and sensations I am the poorest beggar.—However,
I can no longer scrape up the moral courage
to exchange my established position for the excitements
of the wild, adventurous life!
Rodrigo—She had sicked Papa Schigolch and me
out on a hunt together to rout her out some strong
antidote for insomnia. We each got a twenty-mark
piece for expenses. There in the Nightlight Café
we see the youngster sitting like a criminal on the
prisoner’s bench. Schigolch sniffed at him from all
sides, and remarked, “He is still virgin.” [Up in
the gallery, dragging steps are heard.] There she
is! The future magnificent trapeze-artiste of the
present age! [The curtains part at the stair-head,
and Lulu appears, supported by Schigolch and
in Countess Geschwitz’s black dress, slowly and
wearily descending.]
Schigolch—Hui, old moldy! We’ve still to get
over the frontier to-day.
[239]
Rodrigo—[Glaring stupidly at Lulu.] Thunder
of heaven! Death!
Lulu—[Speaks, to the end of the act, in the gayest
tones.] Slowly! You’re pinching my arm!
Rodrigo—How did you ever get the shamelessness
to break out of prison with such a wolf’s face?
Schigolch—Stop your snout!
Rodrigo—I’ll run for the police! I’ll give information!
This scarecrow let herself be seen in
tights? The padding alone would cost two months’
salary!—You’re the most perfidious swindler that
ever had lodging in Ox-butter Hotel!
Alva—Kindly refrain from insulting the lady!
Rodrigo—Insulting, you call that? For this
gnawed bone’s sake I’ve worn myself away! I can’t
earn my own living! I’ll be a clown if I can still
stand firm under a broomstick! But let the lightning
strike me on the spot if I don’t worm ten thousand
marks a year for life out of your tricks and
frauds! I can tell you that! A pleasant trip!
I’m going for the police! [Exit.]
Schigolch—Run, run.
Lulu—He’ll take good care of himself!
Schigolch—We’re rid of him!—And now some
black coffee for the lady!
Alva—[At the table left.] Here is coffee, ready
to pour.
Schigolch—I must look after the sleeping-car
tickets.
Lulu—[Brightly.] Oh, freedom! Thank God
for freedom!
[240]
Schigolch—I’ll be back for you in half an hour.
We’ll celebrate our departure in the station-restaurant.
I’ll order a supper that’ll keep us going till
to-morrow.—Good morning, Doctor.
Alva—Good evening.
Schigolch—Pleasant rest!—Thanks, I know
every door-handle here. So long! Have a good
time! [Exit, centre.]
Lulu—I haven’t seen a room for a year and a
half. Curtains, chairs, pictures....
Alva—Won’t you drink it?
Lulu—I’ve swallowed enough black coffee these
five days. Have you any brandy?
Alva—I’ve got some elixir de Spaa.
Lulu—That reminds one of old times. [Looks
round the hall while Alva fills two glasses.]
Where’s my picture gone?
Alva—I’ve got it in my room, so no one shall
see it here.
Lulu—Bring it here, do!
Alva—Haven’t you got over your vanity even in
prison?
Lulu—How anxious at heart you get when you
don’t see yourself for months! One day I got a
brand-new dust-pan. When I swept up at seven in
the morning I held the back of it up before my face.
Tin doesn’t flatter, but I took pleasure in it all the
same.—Get the picture out of your room. Shall I
come, too?
Alva—No, Heaven’s sake! You must spare yourself!
[241]
Lulu—I’ve been sparing myself long enough now!
[Alva goes out, right, to get the picture.] He has
heart-trouble; but to have to plague one’s self with
imagination fourteen months!... He kisses with
the fear of death on him, and his two knees shake like
a frozen vagabond’s. In God’s name!... In this
room—if only I had not shot his father in the back!
Alva—[Returns with the picture of Lulu in the
Pierrot-dress.] It’s covered with dust. I had leant
it against the fireplace, face to the wall.
Lulu—You didn’t look at it all the time I was
away?
Alva—I had so much business to attend to, with
the sale of our paper and everything. Countess
Geschwitz would have liked to have hung it up in her
house, but she had to be prepared for search-warrants.
[He puts the picture on the easel.]
Lulu—[Merrily.] Now the poor monster is getting
personally acquainted with the life of joy in
Hotel Ox-butter!
Alva—Even now I don’t understand how events
hang together.
Lulu—Oh, Geschwitz arranged it all very cleverly.
I do admire her inventiveness. But the cholera must
have raged fearfully in Hamburg this summer; and
on that she based her plan for freeing me. She took
a course in hospital nursing here, and when she had
the necessary documents she journeyed to Hamburg
with them and nursed the cholera patients. At the
first opportunity that offered she put on the underclothes
that a sick woman had just died in and which
[242]
really ought to have been burnt. The same morning
she traveled back here and came to see me in prison.
In my cell, while the wardress was outside, we two,
as quick as we could, exchanged underclothes.
Alva—So that was the reason why the Countess
and you fell sick of the cholera the same day!
Lulu—Exactly, that was it! Geschwitz of
course was instantly brought from her house to the
contagious ward in the hospital. But with me, too,
they couldn’t think of any other place to take me.
So there we lay in one room in the contagious ward
behind the hospital, and from the first day Geschwitz
put forth all her art to make our two faces as like
each other as possible. Day before yesterday she
was let out as cured. Just now she came back and
said she’d forgotten her watch. I put on her clothes,
she slipped into my prison frock, and then I came
away. [With pleasure.] Now she’s lying over there
as the murderess of Dr. Schön.
Alva—So far as outward appearance goes you
can hold your own with the picture as well as ever.
Lulu—I’m a little peaked in the face, but otherwise
I’ve lost nothing. Only one gets incredibly
nervous in prison.
Alva—You looked horribly sick when you came in.
Lulu—I had to, to get our necks out of the
noose.—And you? What have you done in this year
and a half?
Alva—I’ve had a succès d’estime in literary circles
with a play I wrote about you.
Lulu—Who’s your sweetheart now?
[243]
Alva—An actress I’ve rented a house for in Karl
Street.
Lulu—Does she love you?
Alva—How should I know that? I haven’t seen
the woman for six weeks.
Lulu—Can you stand that?
Alva—You will never grasp it—but with me
there’s the closest alternation between my sensuality
and my creative powers. So, as regards you, for
example, I have to make the choice of either setting
you forth artistically or of loving you.
Lulu—[In a fairy-story tone.] I used to dream,
once, every other night, that I’d fallen into the
hands of a sadist.... Come, give me a kiss!
Alva—It’s shining in your eyes like the water
in a deep well one has just thrown a stone into.
Lulu—Come!
Alva—[Kisses her.] Your lips have got pretty
thin, sure enough.
Lulu—Come! [Pushes him into a chair and seats
herself on his knee.] Do you shudder at me?—In
Hotel Ox-butter we all got a lukewarm bath every
four weeks. The wardresses took that opportunity
to search our pockets as soon as we were in the
water. [She kisses him passionately.]
Alva—Oh, oh!
Lulu—You’re afraid that when I’m away you
couldn’t write any more poems about me?
Alva—On the contrary, I shall write a dithyramb
upon your glory.
[244]
Lulu—I’m only sore about the hideous shoes I’m
wearing.
Alva—They do not encroach upon your charms.
Let us be thankful for the favor of this moment.
Lulu—I don’t feel at all like that to-day.—Do
you remember the costume ball where I was dressed
like a knight’s squire? How those wine-full women
ran after me that time? Geschwitz crawled round,
round my feet, and begged me to step on her face with
my cloth shoes.
Alva—Come, dear heart!
Lulu—[In the tone with which one quiets a restless
child.] Quietly! I shot your father.
Alva—I do not love you less for that. One kiss!
Lulu—Bend your head back. [She kisses him
with deliberation.]
Alva—You hold back the fire of my soul with
the most dexterous art. And your breast breathes
so virginly too. Yet if it weren’t for your two great,
dark, child’s eyes, I must needs have thought you
the cunningest whore that ever hurled a man to
destruction.
Lulu—[In high spirits.] Would God I were!
Come over the border with us to-day! Then we
can see each other as often as we will, and we’ll get
more pleasure from each other than now.
Alva—Through this dress I feel your body like
a symphony. These slender ankles, this cantabile.
This rapturous crescendo. And these knees, this
capriccio. And the powerful andante of lust!—How
peacefully these two slim rivals press against each
[245]
other in the consciousness that neither equals the
other in beauty—till their capricious mistress wakes
up and the rival lovers separate like the two hostile
poles. I shall sing your praises so that your senses
shall whirl!
Lulu—[Merrily.] Meanwhile I’ll bury my hands
in your hair. [She does so.] But here we’ll be disturbed.
Alva—You have robbed me of my reason!
Lulu—Aren’t you coming with me to-day?
Alva—But the old fellow’s going with you!
Lulu—He won’t turn up again.—Is not that the
divan on which your father bled to death?
Alva—Be still. Be still....
CURTAIN
[246]
Scene—A spacious salon in white stucco. In the
rear wall, between two high mirrors, a wide folding
doorway showing in the rear room a big
card-table surrounded by Turkish upholstered
chairs. In the left wall two doors, the upper
one to the entrance-hall, the lower to the dining-room.
Between them a rococo console with a
white marble top, and above it Lulu’s Pierrot-picture
in a narrow gold frame let into the wall.
Two other doors, right; near the lower one a
small table. Wide and brightly covered chairs
stand about, with thin legs and fragile arms;
and in the middle is a sofa of the same style
(Louis XV).
A large company is moving about the salon
in lively conversation. The men—Alva, Rodrigo,
Marquis Casti-Piani, Banker Puntschu,
and Journalist Heilmann—are in
evening dress. Lulu wears a white Directoire
dress with huge sleeves and white lace falling
freely from belt to feet. Her arms are in white
kid gloves, her hair done high with a little tuft
of white feathers. Geschwitz is in a bright
blue hussar-waist trimmed with white fur and
laced with silver braid, a tall tight collar with
a white bow, and stiff cuffs with huge ivory links.
[247]Magelone is in bright rainbow-colored shot
silk with very wide sleeves, long narrow waist,
and three ruffles of spiral rose-colored ribbons
and violet bouquets. Her hair is parted in the
middle and drawn low over her temples. On her
forehead is a mother-of-pearl ornament, held by
a fine chain under her hair. Kadidia, her
daughter, twelve years old, has bright-green
satin gaiters which yet leave visible the tops of
her white silk socks, and a white-lace-covered
dress with bright-green narrow sleeves, pearl-gray
gloves, and free black hair under a big
bright-green hat with white feathers. Bianetta
is in a loose-sleeved dress of dark-green velvet,
the bodice sewn with pearls, and the skirt full,
without a waist, embroidered at the hem with
great false topazes set in silver. Ludmilla
Steinherz is in a glaring summer frock striped
red and blue.
Rodrigo stands, centre, a full glass in his
hand.
Rodrigo—Ladies and gentlemen—I beg your pardon—please
be quiet—I drink—permit me to drink—for
this is the birthday party of our amiable
hostess—[taking Lulu’s arm] of Countess Adelaide
d’Oubra—damned and done for!—I drink therefore — — and
so forth, go to it, ladies! [All surround
Lulu and clink with her. Alva presses Rodrigo’s
hand.]
Alva—I congratulate you.
[248]
Rodrigo—I’m sweating like a roast pig.
Alva—[To Lulu.] Let’s see if everything’s in
order in the card-room. [Alva and Lulu exeunt,
rear. Bianetta speaks to Rodrigo.]
Bianetta—They were telling me just now you
were the strongest man in the world.
Rodrigo—That I am. May I put my strength at
your disposal?
Magelone—I love sharp-shooters better. Three
months ago a sharp-shooter appeared in the Casino,
and every time he went “bang!” I felt like this.
[She wriggles her hips.]
Casti-Piani—[Who speaks thruout the act in a
bored and weary tone, to Magelone.] Say, dearie,
how does it happen we see your nice little princess
here for the first time to-night? [Meaning Kadidia.]
Magelone—Do you really find her so delightful?—She
is still in the convent. She must be back in
school again on Monday.
Kadidia—What did you say, Mama?
Magelone—I was just telling the gentlemen that
you got the highest mark in geometry last week.
Heilmann—Some pretty hair she’s got!
Casti-Piani—Just look at her feet: the way she
walks.
Puntschu—By God, she’s a thoroughbred!
Magelone—[Smiling.] But, my dear sirs, take
pity on her! She’s nothing but a child still!
Puntschu—That’d trouble me damned little!
[To Heilmann.] I’d give ten years of my life if
[249]
I could initiate the young lady into the ceremonies
of our secret society!
Magelone—But you won’t get me to consent to
that for a million. I won’t have the child’s youth
ruined, the way mine was!
Casti-Piani—Confessions of a lovely soul! [To
Magelone.] Would you not grant your permission
even for a set of real diamonds?
Magelone—Don’t brag! You’ll give as few real
diamonds to me as to my child. You know that
best yourself. [Kadidia goes into the rear room.]
Geschwitz—But is nobody at all going to play,
this evening?
Ludmilla—Why, of course, Comtesse. I’m
counting on it very much, for one!
Bianetta—Then let’s take our places right away.
The gentlemen will soon come then.
Geschwitz—May I ask you to excuse me just a
second more? I must say a word to my friend.
Casti-Piani—[Offering his arm to Bianetta.]
May I have the honor to be your partner? You
always hold such a lucky hand!
Ludmilla—Now just give me your other arm and
then lead us into the gambling-hell. [The three go
off so, rear.]
Magelone—Say, Mr. Puntschu, have you still got
a few Jungfrau-shares for me, maybe?
Puntschu—Jungfrau-shares? [To Heilmann.]
The lady means the stock of the funicular railway on
the Jungfrau. The Jungfrau, you know,—the Virgin—is
a mountain and they’re going to build a wire
[250]
railway up it. [To Magelone.] You understand,—just
so there may be no confusion;—and how easy
that would be in this select circle!—Yes, I still have
some four thousand Jungfrau-shares, but I should
like to keep those for myself. There won’t be such
another chance soon of making a little fortune out
of hand.
Heilmann—I’ve only one lone share of this Jungfrau-stock
so far. I should like to have more, too.
Puntschu—I’ll try, Mr. Heilmann, to look after
some for you. But I tell you beforehand you’ll have
to pay drug-store prices for them!
Magelone—My fortune-teller advised me to look
about me in time. All my savings are in Jungfrau-shares
now. If it doesn’t turn out well, Mr. Puntschu,
I’ll scratch your eyes out!
Puntschu—I am perfectly sure of my affairs,
my dearie!
Alva—[Who has come back from the card-room,
to Magelone.] I can guarantee your fears are
absolutely unfounded. I paid very dear for my
Jungfrau-stock and haven’t regretted it a minute.
They’re going up steadily from day to day. There
never was such a thing before.
Magelone—All the better, if you’re right. [Taking
Puntschu’s arm.] Come, my friend, let’s try
our luck now at baccarat. [All go out, rear, except
Geschwitz and Rodrigo, who scribbles something on
a piece of paper and folds it up, then notices
Geschwitz.]
Rodrigo—Hm, madam Countess—— [Geschwitz
[251]starts and shrinks.] Do I look as dangerous as
that? [To himself.] I must make a bon mot.
[Aloud.] May I perhaps make so bold⁠——
Geschwitz—You can go to the devil!
Casti-Piani—[As he leads Lulu in.] You will
allow me a word or two.
Lulu—[Not noticing Rodrigo, who presses his
note into her hand.] Oh, as many as you like.
Rodrigo—[As he bows and goes out, rear.] I beg
you will excuse me....
Casti-Piani—[To Geschwitz.] Leave us alone!
Lulu—[To Casti-Piani.] Have I vexed you
again somehow?
Casti-Piani—[Since Geschwitz does not stir.]
Are you deaf? [Geschwitz, sighing deeply, goes
out, rear.]
Lulu—Just say straight out how much you want.
Casti-Piani—With money you can no longer
serve me.
Lulu—What makes you think that we have no
more money?
Casti-Piani—You handed out the last bit of it to
me yesterday.
Lulu—If you’re sure of that then I suppose
it’s so.
Casti-Piani—You’re down to bedrock, you and
your writer.
Lulu—Then why all these words?—If you want
to have me for yourself you need not first threaten
me with execution.
Casti-Piani—I know that. But I’ve told you
[252]
more than once that you are not the sort I fall for.
I haven’t plundered you because you loved me, but
loved you in order to fleece you. Bianetta is more
to my taste from top to bottom than you. You set
out the choicest lot of sweetmeats, and when one has
frittered his time away at them he finds he’s hungrier
than before. You’ve loved too long, even for our
relations here. With a healthy young man, you
only ruin his nervous system. But you’ll fit all the
more perfectly in the position I have sought out for
you.
Lulu—You’re crazy! Have I commissioned you
to find a position for me?
Casti-Piani—I told you, though, that I was an
employment-agent.
Lulu—You told me you were a police spy.
Casti-Piani—One can’t live on that alone. I was
an employment-agent originally, till I blundered over
a minister’s daughter I’d got a position for in Valparaiso.
The little darling in her childhood’s
dreams had imagined the life to be even more intoxicating
than it is, and complained about it to
Mama. On that, they nabbed me; but by reliable
demeanor I soon enough won the confidence of the
criminal police and they sent me here on a hundred
and fifty marks a month, because they were tripling
our contingent here on account of these everlasting
bomb-explosions. But who can get along in Paris
on a hundred and fifty marks a month? My colleagues
get women to support them; but, of course,
I found it more convenient to take up my former
[253]
calling again; and of the numberless adventuresses
of the best families of the entire world, whom chance
brings together here, I have already forwarded many
a young creature hungry for life to the place of her
natural vocation.
Lulu—[Decisively.] I’m no good for that business.
Casti-Piani—Your views on that question make
no difference whatever to me. The department of
justice will pay anyone who delivers the murderess
of Dr. Schön into the hands of the police a thousand
marks. I only need to whistle for the constable
who’s standing down at the corner to have earned
a thousand marks. Against that, the House of
Oikonomopulos in Cairo bids sixty pounds for you—twelve
hundred marks—two hundred more than
the Attorney General. And, besides, I am still so
far a friend of mankind that I prefer to help my
loves to happiness, not hurl them into misery.
Lulu—[As before.] The life in such a house can
never in the world make a woman of my sort happy.
When I was fifteen, I might have liked it. I was
desperate then—thought I should never be happy.
I bought a revolver, and ran one night barefoot
through the deep snow over the bridge to the park
to shoot myself there. But then by good luck I lay
three months in the hospital without once getting
sight of a man, and in that time my eyes were opened
and I got to know myself. Night after night in my
dreams I saw the man for whom I was created and
who was created for me, so that when I was let out
[254]
on the men again I was a silly goose no longer. Since
then I can see on a man, in a pitch-dark night and
a hundred feet away, whether we’re meant for each
other; and if I sin against that insight I feel the
next day dirtied, body and soul, and need weeks to
get over the loathing I have for myself. And now
you imagine I’ll give myself to every and any Tom
and Harry!
Casti-Piani—Toms and Harries don’t patronize
Oikonomopulos of Cairo. His custom consists of
Scottish lords, Russian dignitaries, Indian governors,
and our jolly Rhineland captains of industry. I
must only guarantee that you speak French. With
your gift for languages you’ll quickly enough learn
as much English, besides, as you’ll need to get on
with. And you’ll reside in a royally furnished
apartment with an outlook on the minarets of the
El Azhar Mosque, and walk around all day on Persian
carpets as thick as your fist, and dress every
evening in a fabulous Paris gown, and drink as much
champagne as your customers can pay for, and,
finally, you’ll even remain, up to a certain point, your
own mistress. If the man doesn’t please you, you
needn’t play up to him at all. Just let him give in
his card, and then——[Shrugs, and snaps his fingers.]
If the ladies didn’t get used to that the whole
business would be simply impossible, because every
one of them after the first few weeks would go headlong
to the devil.
Lulu—[Her voice shaking.] I do believe that
since yesterday you’ve got a screw loose somewhere.
[255]
Am I to understand that the Egyptian will pay fifteen
hundred francs for a person whom he’s never
seen?
Casti-Piani—I took the liberty of sending him
your pictures.
Lulu—Those pictures that I gave you, you’ve
sent to him?
Casti-Piani—You see he can value them better
than I. The picture in which you stand before the
mirror as Eve he’ll probably hang up at the house-door,
after you’ve got there.... And then there’s
one thing more for you to notice: with Oikonomopulos
in Cairo you’ll be safer from your bloodhounds
than if you crept into a Canadian wilderness.
It isn’t so easy to transport an Egyptian courtesan
to a German prison,—first, on account of the mere
expense, and second, from fear of treading too close
upon eternal Justice.
Lulu—[Proudly, in a clear voice.] What have
I to do with your eternal Justice! You can see as
plain as your five fingers I shan’t let myself be locked
up in any such amusement-place!
Casti-Piani—Then will you permit me to whistle
up the policeman?
Lulu—[In wonder.] Why don’t you simply ask
me for twelve hundred marks, if you want the money?
Casti-Piani—I want for no money! And I also
don’t ask for it because you’re dead broke.
Lulu—We still have thirty thousand marks.
Casti-Piani—In Jungfrau-stock! I never have
anything to do with stock. The Attorney General
[256]
pays in the imperial currency, and Oikonomopulos
pays in English gold. You can be on board early
to-morrow. The passage doesn’t last much more
than five days. In two weeks at most you’re in
safety. Here you are nearer to prison than anywhere.
It’s a wonder which I, as one of the secret
police, cannot understand, that you two have been
able to live for a full year unmolested. But just
as I came on the track of your antecedents, so any
day, with your mighty consumption of men, one of
my colleagues may make the happy discovery. Then
I may just wipe my mouth, and you spend the most
enjoyable years of your life in prison. If you will
kindly decide quickly. The train goes at 12:30.
If we haven’t struck a bargain before eleven, I
whistle up the policeman. If we have, I pack you,
just as you stand, into a carriage, drive you to the
station, and to-morrow night escort you on board
ship.
Lulu—But is it possible you can be serious in all
this?
Casti-Piani—Don’t you understand that your
bodily rescue is the only thing left me to do?
Lulu—I’ll go with you to America or to China,
but I can’t let myself be sold of my own accord!
That is worse than prison!
Casti-Piani—[Drawing a letter from his pocket.]
Just read this effusion! I’ll read it to you. Here’s
the postmark “Cairo,” so you won’t believe I work
with forged documents. The girl is a Berliner, was
married two years and to a man whom you would
[257]
have envied her, a former comrade of mine. He
travels now for some Hamburg colonial company....
Lulu—[Merrily.] Then perhaps he visits his
wife occasionally?
Casti-Piani—That is not incredible. But hear
this impulsive expression of her feelings. My white-slave
traffic seems to me absolutely no more honorable
than the first judge you happened on would
think it, but a cry of joy like this lets me feel a
certain moral satisfaction for a moment. I am proud
to earn my money by scattering happiness with full
hands. [Reads.] “Dear Mr. Meyer”—that’s my
name as a white-slave trader—“when you go to Berlin,
please go right away to the conservatory on the
Potsdamer Strasse and ask for Gusti von Rosenkron—the
most beautiful woman that I’ve ever seen anywhere—delightful
hands and feet, naturally small
waist, straight back, full body, big eyes and short
nose—just the sort you like best. I have written to
her already. She has no prospects with her singing.
Her mother hasn’t a penny. Sorry she’s already
twenty-two, but she’s pining for love. Can’t marry,
because absolutely without means. I have spoken
with Madame. They’d like to take another German,
if she’s well educated and musical. Italians and
Frenchwomen can’t compete with us;—not cultured
enough. If you should see Fritz”—Fritz is the husband;
he’s getting a divorce, of course,—“tell him
it was all a bore. He didn’t know any better, neither
did I.” Now come the exact details⁠——
[258]
Lulu—[Goaded.] I cannot sell the only thing
that ever was my own!
Casti-Piani—Let me read some more.
Lulu—[As before.] This very evening, I’ll hand
over to you our entire wealth.
Casti-Piani—Believe me, for God’s sake, I’ve got
your last red cent! If we haven’t left this house before
eleven, you and your lot will be transported
to-morrow in a police-car to Germany.
Lulu—You can’t give me up!
Casti-Piani—Do you think that would be the
worst thing I “can” have done in my life?... I
must, in case we go to-night, have just a brief word
with Bianetta. [He goes into the card-room, leaving
the door open behind him. Lulu stares before her,
mechanically crumpling up the note that Rodrigo
stuck into her hand, which she has held in her fingers
thruout the dialogue. Alva, behind the card-table,
gets up, a bill in his hand, and comes into the
salon.]
Alva—[To Lulu.] Brilliantly! It’s going brilliantly!
Geschwitz is wagering her last shirt.
Puntschu has promised me ten more Jungfrau-shares.
Steinherz is making her little gains and profits.
[Exit, lower right.]
Lulu—I in a bordel? [She reads the paper she
holds, and laughs madly.]
Alva—[Coming back with a cash-box in his
hand.] Aren’t you going to play, too?
Lulu—Oh, yes, surely—why not?
Alva—By the way, it’s in the “Berliner Tageblatt”
[259]
to-day that Alfred Hugenberg has hurled himself
over the stairs in prison.
Lulu—Is he too in prison?
Alva—Only in a sort of house of detention.
[Exit, rear. Lulu is about to follow, but Countess
Geschwitz meets her in the doorway.]
Geschwitz—You are going because I come?
Lulu—[Resolutely.] No, God knows. But when
you come then I go.
Geschwitz—You have defrauded me of all the
good things of this world that I still possessed. You
might at the very least preserve the outward forms
of politeness in your intercourse with me.
Lulu—[As before.] I am as polite to you as to
any other woman. I only beg you to be equally so
to me.
Geschwitz—Have you forgotten the passionate
endearments you used, while we lay together in the
hospital, to seduce me into letting myself be locked
into prison for you?
Lulu—Well, why else did you bring me down with
the cholera beforehand? I swore very different
things to myself, even while it was going on, from
what I had to promise you! I am shaken with horror
at the thought that that should ever become reality!
Geschwitz—Then you cheated me consciously,
deliberately!
Lulu—[Gaily.] And what have you been cheated
of, eh? Your physical advantages have found so
enthusiastic an admirer here, that I ask myself if
I won’t have to give piano lessons once more, to keep
[260]
alive! No seventeen-year-old child could make a
man madder with love than you, a pervert, are making
him, poor fellow, by your shrewishness.
Geschwitz—Of whom are you speaking? I don’t
understand a word.
Lulu—[As before.] I’m speaking of your acrobat,
of Rodrigo Quast. He’s an athlete: he balances
two saddled cavalry horses on his chest. Can a
woman desire anything more glorious? He told me
just now that he’d jump into the water to-night if
you did not take pity on him.
Geschwitz—I do not envy you your cleverness at
torturing the helpless victims sacrificed to you by
their inscrutable destiny. I cannot envy you at all.
My own misery has not yet wrung from me the pity
that I feel for you. I feel free as a god when I
think to what creatures you are enslaved.
Lulu—Whom do you mean?
Geschwitz—Casti-Piani, upon whose forehead the
most degenerate baseness is written in letters of fire!
Lulu—Be silent! I’ll kick you, if you speak ill
of him. He loves me so uprightly that your most
venturous self-sacrifices are beggary in comparison!
He gives me such proofs of self-denial as reveal you
for the first time in all your loathsomeness! You
didn’t get finished in your mother’s womb, neither
as woman nor as man. You have no human nature
like the rest of us. The stuff didn’t go far enough
for a man, and for a woman you got too much brain
in your noddle. That’s the reason you’re crazy!
Turn to Miss Bianetta! She can be had for everything
[261]
for pay! Press a gold-piece into her hand
and she’ll be yours. [All the company save Kadidia
throng in out of the card-room.] For the Lord’s
sake, what has happened?
Puntschu—Nothing whatever! We’re thirsty,
that’s all.
Magelone—Everybody has won. We can’t believe
it.
Bianetta—Seems to me I have won quite a
fortune!
Ludmilla—Don’t boast of it, my child. That
isn’t lucky.
Magelone—But the bank has won, too! How is
that possible?
Alva—It is colossal, where all the money comes
from!
Casti-Piani—Let us not ask! Enough that we
need not spare the champagne.
Heilmann—I can pay for a supper in a respectable
restaurant afterwards, anyway!
Alva—To the buffet, ladies! Come to the buffet!
[All exeunt, lower left.]
Rodrigo—[Holding Lulu back.] Un momong,
my heart. Have you read my billet-doux?
Lulu—Threaten me with discovery as much as
you like! I have no more twenty thousands to dispose
of.
Rodrigo—Don’t lie to me, you punk! You’ve still
got forty thousand in Jungfrau-stock. Your so-called
spouse has just been bragging of it himself!
Lulu—Then turn to him with your blackmailing!
[262]
It’s all one to me what he does with his money.
Rodrigo—Thank you! With that blockhead I’d
need twice twenty-four hours to make him grasp what
I was talking about. And then come his explanations,
that make one deathly sick; and meanwhile
my bride-to-be writes me to call it off, and I can
just hang a hurdy-gurdy over my shoulder.
Lulu—What, have you got engaged here?
Rodrigo—Maybe I ought to have asked your permission
first? What were my thanks here for having
freed you from prison at the cost of my health?
You abandoned me! I might have had to turn porter
if this girl hadn’t taken me up! At my entrance,
the very first evening, somebody threw a velvet-covered
arm-chair at my head! This country is too
decadent to value genuine shows of strength any
more. If I’d been a boxing kangaroo they’d have
interviewed me and put my picture in all the papers.
Thank Heaven, I’d already made the acquaintance of
my Celestine. She’s got the savings of twenty years
deposited with the government; and she loves me
just for myself. She doesn’t aim at vile vulgarities
and nothing else like you. She’s had three children
by an American bishop—all of the greatest promise.
Early day after to-morrow we’re going to get married
at the registrar’s.
Lulu—You have my blessing.
Rodrigo—Your blessing can be stolen from me.
I’ve told my bride I had twenty thousand in stock
at the bank.
[263]
Lulu—[Amused.] And after that he boasts the
woman loves him for himself!
Rodrigo—She honors in me the man of feeling, not
the man of force as you and all the others have done.
That’s well over now. First they’d tear the clothes
from one’s body and then waltz around with the
chambermaid. I’ll be a skeleton before I’ll let myself
in again for such diversions!
Lulu—Then why the devil do you especially pursue
poor Geschwitz with your proposals?
Rodrigo—Because the thing is of noble blood.
I’m a man of the world, and can do distinguished
conversation better than any of you. But now [with
a gesture] my talk is hanging out of my mouth!
Will you get me the money before to-morrow evening,
or won’t you?
Lulu—I have no money.
Rodrigo—I’ll have hen-droppings in my head
before I’ll let myself be put off with that! He’ll give
you his last cent if you’ll only do your damned debt
and duty by him once! You lured the poor lad here,
and now he can see where to scare up a suitable
engagement for his accomplishments.
Lulu—What is it to you if he wastes his money
with women or at cards?
Rodrigo—Do you absolutely want, then, to
throw the last penny that his father earned by his
paper into the jaws of this rapacious pack? You’ll
make four people happy if you’ll strain a point and
sacrifice yourself for a philanthropic purpose! Has
it got to be only Casti-Piani forever?
[264]
Lulu—[Lightly.] Shall I ask him perhaps to
light you down the stairs?
Rodrigo—As you wish, Countess! If I don’t get
the twenty thousand marks by to-morrow evening,
I make a statement to the police and your salon
comes to an end. Auf Wiedersehen! [Heilmann
enters, breathless, upper right.]
Lulu—You’re looking for Miss Magelone? She’s
not here.
Heilmann—No, I’m looking for something else⁠——
Rodrigo—[Taking him to the entry-door, opposite
him.] Second door on the left.
Lulu—[To Rodrigo.] Did you learn that from
your bride?
Heilmann—[Bumping into Puntschu in the
doorway.] Excuse me, my angel!
Puntschu—Ah, it’s you. Miss Magelone’s waiting
for you in the lift.
Heilmann—You go up with her, please. I’ll be
right back. [He hurries out, left. Lulu goes out
at lower left. Rodrigo follows her.]
Puntschu—Some heat, that! If I don’t cut off
your ears, you’ll cut ’em off me! If I can’t hire
out my Jehoshaphat,⁠[9] I’ve just got to help myself
with my brains! Won’t they get wrinkled, my
brains! Won’t they get indisposed! Won’t they
need to bathe in Eau de Cologne! [Bob, a groom
in a red jacket, tight leather breeches, and twinkling
riding-boots, fifteen years old, brings in a telegram.]
Bob—Mr. Puntschu, the banker!
[265]
Puntschu—[Breaks open the telegram and murmurs:]
“Jungfrau Funicular Stock fallen to——”
Ay, ay, so goes the world! [To Bob.] Wait!
[Gives him a tip.] Tell me—what’s your name?
Bob—Well, my name is Freddy, but they call me
Bob, because that’s the fashion now.
Puntschu—How old are you?
Bob—Fifteen.
Kadidia—[Enters hesitatingly from lower left.] I
beg your pardon, can you tell me if Mama is here?
Puntschu—No, my dear. [Aside.] Devil, she’s
got breeding!
Kadidia—I’m hunting all over for her; I can’t
find her anywhere.
Puntschu—Your mama will turn up again soon,
as true as my name’s Puntschu! [Looking at Bob.]
And that pair of breeches! God of Justice! It gets
uncanny! [He goes out, upper right.]
Kadidia—Haven’t you seen my mama, perhaps?
Bob—No, but you only need to come with me.
Kadidia—Where is she then?
Bob—She’s gone up in the lift. Come along.
Kadidia—No, no, I can’t go up with you.
Bob—We can hide up there in the corridor.
Kadidia—No, no, I can’t come, or I’ll be scolded.
[Magelone, terribly excited, rushes in, upper left,
and possesses herself of Kadidia.]
Magelone—Ha, there you are at last, you common
creature!
Kadidia—[Crying.] O Mama, Mama, I was
hunting for you!
[266]
Magelone—Hunting for me? Did I tell you to
hunt for me? What have you had to do with this
fellow? [Heilmann, Alva, Ludmilla, Puntschu,
Geschwitz, and Lulu enter, lower left. Bob has
slipped away.] Now don’t bawl before all the people
on me; look out, I tell you!
Lulu—[As they all surround Kadidia.] But
you’re crying, sweetheart! Why are you crying?
Puntschu—By God, she’s really been crying!
Who’s done anything to hurt you, little goddess?
Ludmilla—[Kneels before her and folds her in
her arms.] Tell me, cherub, what bad thing has
happened. Do you want a cookie? Do you want
some chocolate?
Magelone—It’s just nerves. The child’s getting
them much too soon. It would be best, anyway, if
no one paid any attention to her!
Puntschu—That sounds like you! You’re a
pretty mother! The courts’ll take the child away
from you yet and appoint me her guardian! [Stroking
Kadidia’s cheeks.] Isn’t that so, my little goddess?
Geschwitz—I should be glad if we could start the
baccarat again at last! [All go into the dining-room
again. Lulu is held back at the door by Bob, who
comes from the upper entrance.]
Lulu—[When Bob has whispered to her.] Certainly!
Let him come in! [Bob opens the hall door
and lets Schigolch enter, in evening dress, his patent-leather
shoes much worn, and keeping on his
shabby opera hat.]
[267]
Schigolch—[With a look at Bob.] Where did
you get him from?
Lulu—The circus.
Schigolch—How much does he get?
Lulu—Ask him if it interests you. [To Bob.]
Shut the doors. [Bob goes out lower left, shutting
the door behind him.]
Schigolch—[Sitting down.] The truth is, I’m
in need of money. I’ve hired a flat for my mistress.
Lulu—Have you taken another mistress here,
too?
Schigolch—She’s from Frankfort. In her youth
she was mistress to the King of Naples. She tells me
every day she was once very bewitching.
Lulu—[Outwardly with complete composure.]
Does she need the money very badly?
Schigolch—She wants to fit up her own apartments.
Such sums are of no account to you. [Lulu
is suddenly overcome with a fit of weeping.]
Lulu—[Flinging herself at Schigolch.] O God
Almighty!
Schigolch—[Patting her.] Well? What is it
now?
Lulu—[Sobbing violently.] It’s too horrible!
Schigolch—[Draws her onto his knee and holds
her in his arms like a little child.] Hm—You’re
trying to do too much, child. You must go to bed,
now and then, with a story.—Cry, that’s right, cry
it all out. It used to shake you just so fifteen years
ago. Nobody has screamed since then, the way you
could scream! You didn’t wear any white tufts
[268]
on your head then, nor any transparent stockings
on your legs: you had neither shoes nor stockings
then.
Lulu—[Crying.] Take me home with you!
Take me home with you to-night! Please! We’ll
find carriages enough downstairs!
Schigolch—I’ll take you with me; I’ll take you
with me.—What is it?
Lulu—It’s going round my neck! I’m to be
shown up!
Schigolch—By whom? Who’s showing you up?
Lulu—The acrobat.
Schigolch—[With the utmost composure.] I’ll
look after him.
Lulu—Look after him! Please, look after
him! Then do with me what you will!
Schigolch—If he comes to me, he’s done for. My
window is over the water. But [shaking his head]
he won’t come; he won’t come.
Lulu—What number do you live at?
Schigolch—376, the last house before the hippodrome.
Lulu—I’ll send him there. He’ll come with the
crazy woman that creeps about my feet. He’ll come
this very evening. Go home and let them find it
comfortable.
Schigolch—Just let them come.
Lulu—To-morrow bring me the gold rings he
wears in his ears.
Schigolch—Has he got rings in his ears?
Lulu—You can take them out before you let him
[269]
down. He doesn’t notice anything when he’s drunk.
Schigolch—And then, child—what then?
Lulu—Then I’ll give you the money for your mistress.
Schigolch—I call that pretty stingy.
Lulu—And whatever else you want! Whatever
I have.
Schigolch—It’ll soon be ten years since we knew
each other.
Lulu—Is that all?—But you’ve got a mistress.
Schigolch—My Frankforter is no longer of to-day.
Lulu—But then swear!
Schigolch—Haven’t I always kept my word to
you?
Lulu—Swear that you’ll look after him.
Schigolch—I’ll look after him.
Lulu—Swear it to me! Swear it to me!
Schigolch—[Puts his hand on her ankle.] By
everything that’s holy! To-night, if he comes⁠——
Lulu—By everything that’s holy!—How that
cools me!
Schigolch—How this heats me!
Lulu—Oh, do drive straight home. They’ll come
in half an hour! Take a carriage!
Schigolch—I’m going.
Lulu—Quick! Please!— —All-powerful⁠——
Schigolch—Why do you stare at me so again
already?
Lulu—Nothing— ...
[270]
Schigolch—Well? Is your tongue frozen on
you?
Lulu—My garter’s broken.
Schigolch—What if it is? Is that all?
Lulu—What does that augur?
Schigolch—What does it? I’ll fasten it for you
if you’ll keep still.
Lulu—That augurs misfortune!
Schigolch—[Yawning.] Not for you, child.
Cheer up, I’ll look after him! [Exit. Lulu puts
her left foot on a foot-stool, fastens her garter, and
goes out into the card-room. Then Rodrigo is cuffed
in from the dining-room, lower left, by Casti-Piani.]
Rodrigo—You can treat me decently anyway!
Casti-Piani—[Still perfectly unemotional.]
Whatever would induce me to do that? I wish to
know what you said to her here a little while ago.
Rodrigo—Then you can be very fond of me!
Casti-Piani—Will you bandy words with me, dog?
You demanded that she go up in the lift with you!
Rodrigo—That’s a shameless, perfidious lie!
Casti-Piani—She told me so herself. You
threatened to denounce her if she didn’t go with you.—Shall
I shoot you on the spot?
Rodrigo—The shameless hussy! As if anything
like that could occur to me!—Even if I should want
to have her, God knows I don’t first need to threaten
her with prison!
Casti-Piani—Thank you. That’s all I wanted to
know. [Exit, upper left.]
Rodrigo—Such a hound! A fellow I could throw
[271]
up onto the roof so he’d stick like a Limburger
cheese!—Come back here, so I can wind your guts
round your neck. That would be even better!
Lulu—[Enters, lower left; merrily.] Where were
you? I’ve been hunting for you like a pin.
Rodrigo—I’ve shown him what it means to start
anything with me!
Lulu—Whom?
Rodrigo—Your Casti-Piani! What made you tell
him, you slut, that I wanted to seduce you?!
Lulu—Did you not demand that I give myself
to my late husband’s son for twenty thousand in
Jungfrau-shares?
Rodrigo—Because it’s your duty to take pity on
the poor young fellow! You shot away his father
before his nose in the prime of his life! But your
Casti-Piani will think it over before he comes into
my sight again. I gave him one in the basket that
made his tripe fly to heaven like Roman candles. If
that’s the best substitute you have for me, then I’m
sorry I ever enjoyed your favor!
Lulu—Lady Geschwitz is in the fearfullest case.
She twists herself up in fits. She’s at the point of
jumping into the water if you let her wait any
longer.
Rodrigo—What’s the beast waiting for?
Lulu—For you to take her with you.
Rodrigo—Then give her my regards, and she can
jump into the water.
Lulu—She’ll lend me twenty thousand marks to
save me from destruction if you will preserve her
[272]
from it herself. If you’ll take her off to-night, I’ll
deposit twenty thousand marks to-morrow in your
name at any bank you say.
Rodrigo—And if I don’t take her off with me?
Lulu—Denounce me! Alva and I are dead broke.
Rodrigo—Devil and damnation!
Lulu—You make four people happy if you strain
a point and sacrifice yourself for a worthy end.
Rodrigo—It won’t go; I know that, beforehand.
I’ve tried the thing out thoroughly. Who’d have
expected such a creditable feeling in that bag
o’ bones! What interested me in her was her being
an aristocrat. My behavior was as gentleman-like,
and more, as you could find among German circus-people.
If I’d only just pinched her in the calves
once!
Lulu—[Watchfully.] She is still a virgin.
Rodrigo—[Sighing.] If there’s a God in heaven,
you’ll get paid for your jokes some day! I prophesy
that.
Lulu—Geschwitz waits. What shall I tell her?
Rodrigo—My very best wishes, and I am perverse.
Lulu—I will deliver that.
Rodrigo—Wait a second. Is it certain sure I
get twenty thousand marks from her?
Lulu—Ask herself!
Rodrigo—Then tell her I’m ready. I await her
in the dining-room. I must just first look after a
barrel of caviare. [Exit, left. Lulu opens the rear
door and calls in a clear voice “Martha!” Countess
Geschwitz enters, closing the door behind her.]
[273]
Lulu—[Pleased.] Dear heart, you can save me
from death to-night.
Geschwitz—How?
Lulu—By going to a certain house with the acrobat.
Geschwitz—What for, dear?
Lulu—He says you must belong to him this very
night or he’ll denounce me to-morrow.
Geschwitz—You know I can’t belong to any man.
My fate has not permitted that.<

Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.
Everything was in confusion in the Oblonskys’ house. The wife had
discovered that the husband was carrying on an intrigue with a French girl, who
had been a governess in their family, and she had announced to her husband that
she could not go on living in the same house with him. This position of affairs
had now lasted three days, and not only the husband and wife themselves, but
all the members of their family and household, were painfully conscious of it.
Every person in the house felt that there was no sense in their living
together, and that the stray people brought together by chance in any inn had
more in common with one another than they, the members of the family and
household of the Oblonskys. The wife did not leave her own room, the husband
had not been at home for three days. The children ran wild all over the house;
the English governess quarreled with the housekeeper, and wrote to a friend
asking her to look out for a new situation for her; the man-cook had walked off
the day before just at dinner time; the kitchen-maid, and the coachman had
given warning.
Three days after the quarrel, Prince Stepan Arkadyevitch Oblonsky—Stiva,
as he was called in the fashionable world—woke up at his usual hour, that
is, at eight o’clock in the morning, not in his wife’s bedroom, but
on the leather-covered sofa in his study. He turned over his stout,
well-cared-for person on the springy sofa, as though he would sink into a long
sleep again; he vigorously embraced the pillow on the other side and buried his
face in it; but all at once he jumped up, sat up on the sofa, and opened his
eyes.
“Yes, yes, how was it now?” he thought, going over his dream.
“Now, how was it? To be sure! Alabin was giving a dinner at Darmstadt;
no, not Darmstadt, but something American. Yes, but then, Darmstadt was in
America. Yes, Alabin was giving a dinner on glass tables, and the tables sang,
Il mio tesoro—not Il mio tesoro though, but something
better, and there were some sort of little decanters on the table, and they
were women, too,” he remembered.
Stepan Arkadyevitch’s eyes twinkled gaily, and he pondered with a smile.
“Yes, it was nice, very nice. There was a great deal more that was
delightful, only there’s no putting it into words, or even expressing it
in one’s thoughts awake.” And noticing a gleam of light peeping in
beside one of the serge curtains, he cheerfully dropped his feet over the edge
of the sofa, and felt about with them for his slippers, a present on his last
birthday, worked for him by his wife on gold-colored morocco. And, as he had
done every day for the last nine years, he stretched out his hand, without
getting up, towards the place where his dressing-gown always hung in his
bedroom. And thereupon he suddenly remembered that he was not sleeping in his
wife’s room, but in his study, and why: the smile vanished from his face,
he knitted his brows.
“Ah, ah, ah! Oo!...” he muttered, recalling everything that had
happened. And again every detail of his quarrel with his wife was present to
his imagination, all the hopelessness of his position, and worst of all, his
own fault.
“Yes, she won’t forgive me, and she can’t forgive me. And the
most awful thing about it is that it’s all my fault—all my fault,
though I’m not to blame. That’s the point of the whole
situation,” he reflected. “Oh, oh, oh!” he kept repeating in
despair, as he remembered the acutely painful sensations caused him by this
quarrel.
Most unpleasant of all was the first minute when, on coming, happy and
good-humored, from the theater, with a huge pear in his hand for his wife, he
had not found his wife in the drawing-room, to his surprise had not found her
in the study either, and saw her at last in her bedroom with the unlucky letter
that revealed everything in her hand.
She, his Dolly, forever fussing and worrying over household details, and
limited in her ideas, as he considered, was sitting perfectly still with the
letter in her hand, looking at him with an expression of horror, despair, and
indignation.
“What’s this? this?” she asked, pointing to the letter.
And at this recollection, Stepan Arkadyevitch, as is so often the case, was not
so much annoyed at the fact itself as at the way in which he had met his
wife’s words.
There happened to him at that instant what does happen to people when they are
unexpectedly caught in something very disgraceful. He did not succeed in
adapting his face to the position in which he was placed towards his wife by
the discovery of his fault. Instead of being hurt, denying, defending himself,
begging forgiveness, instead of remaining indifferent even—anything would
have been better than what he did do—his face utterly involuntarily
(reflex spinal action, reflected Stepan Arkadyevitch, who was fond of
physiology)—utterly involuntarily assumed its habitual, good-humored, and
therefore idiotic smile.
This idiotic smile he could not forgive himself. Catching sight of that smile,
Dolly shuddered as though at physical pain, broke out with her characteristic
heat into a flood of cruel words, and rushed out of the room. Since then she
had refused to see her husband.
“It’s that idiotic smile that’s to blame for it all,”
thought Stepan Arkadyevitch.
“But what’s to be done? What’s to be done?” he said to
himself in despair, and found no answer.
Stepan Arkadyevitch was a truthful man in his relations with himself. He was
incapable of deceiving himself and persuading himself that he repented of his
conduct. He could not at this date repent of the fact that he, a handsome,
susceptible man of thirty-four, was not in love with his wife, the mother of
five living and two dead children, and only a year younger than himself. All he
repented of was that he had not succeeded better in hiding it from his wife.
But he felt all the difficulty of his position and was sorry for his wife, his
children, and himself. Possibly he might have managed to conceal his sins
better from his wife if he had anticipated that the knowledge of them would
have had such an effect on her. He had never clearly thought out the subject,
but he had vaguely conceived that his wife must long ago have suspected him of
being unfaithful to her, and shut her eyes to the fact. He had even supposed
that she, a worn-out woman no longer young or good-looking, and in no way
remarkable or interesting, merely a good mother, ought from a sense of fairness
to take an indulgent view. It had turned out quite the other way.
“Oh, it’s awful! oh dear, oh dear! awful!” Stepan
Arkadyevitch kept repeating to himself, and he could think of nothing to be
done. “And how well things were going up till now! how well we got on!
She was contented and happy in her children; I never interfered with her in
anything; I let her manage the children and the house just as she liked.
It’s true it’s bad her having been a governess in our house.
That’s bad! There’s something common, vulgar, in flirting with
one’s governess. But what a governess!” (He vividly recalled the
roguish black eyes of Mlle. Roland and her smile.) “But after all, while
she was in the house, I kept myself in hand. And the worst of it all is that
she’s already ... it seems as if ill-luck would have it so! Oh, oh! But
what, what is to be done?”
There was no solution, but that universal solution which life gives to all
questions, even the most complex and insoluble. That answer is: one must live
in the needs of the day—that is, forget oneself. To forget himself in
sleep was impossible now, at least till nighttime; he could not go back now to
the music sung by the decanter-women; so he must forget himself in the dream of
daily life.
“Then we shall see,” Stepan Arkadyevitch said to himself, and
getting up he put on a gray dressing-gown lined with blue silk, tied the
tassels in a knot, and, drawing a deep breath of air into his broad, bare
chest, he walked to the window with his usual confident step, turning out his
feet that carried his full frame so easily. He pulled up the blind and rang the
bell loudly. It was at once answered by the appearance of an old friend, his
valet, Matvey, carrying his clothes, his boots, and a telegram. Matvey was
followed by the barber with all the necessaries for shaving.
“Are there any papers from the office?” asked Stepan Arkadyevitch,
taking the telegram and seating himself at the looking-glass.
“On the table,” replied Matvey, glancing with inquiring sympathy at
his master; and, after a short pause, he added with a sly smile,
“They’ve sent from the carriage-jobbers.”
Stepan Arkadyevitch made no reply, he merely glanced at Matvey in the
looking-glass. In the glance, in which their eyes met in the looking-glass, it
was clear that they understood one another. Stepan Arkadyevitch’s eyes
asked: “Why do you tell me that? don’t you know?”
Matvey put his hands in his jacket pockets, thrust out one leg, and gazed
silently, good-humoredly, with a faint smile, at his master.
“I told them to come on Sunday, and till then not to trouble you or
themselves for nothing,” he said. He had obviously prepared the sentence
beforehand.
Stepan Arkadyevitch saw Matvey wanted to make a joke and attract attention to
himself. Tearing open the telegram, he read it through, guessing at the words,
misspelt as they always are in telegrams, and his face brightened.
“Matvey, my sister Anna Arkadyevna will be here tomorrow,” he said,
checking for a minute the sleek, plump hand of the barber, cutting a pink path
through his long, curly whiskers.
“Thank God!” said Matvey, showing by this response that he, like
his master, realized the significance of this arrival—that is, that Anna
Arkadyevna, the sister he was so fond of, might bring about a reconciliation
between husband and wife.
“Alone, or with her husband?” inquired Matvey.
Stepan Arkadyevitch could not answer, as the barber was at work on his upper
lip, and he raised one finger. Matvey nodded at the looking-glass.
“Alone. Is the room to be got ready upstairs?”
“Inform Darya Alexandrovna: where she orders.”
“Darya Alexandrovna?” Matvey repeated, as though in doubt.
“Yes, inform her. Here, take the telegram; give it to her, and then do
what she tells you.”
“You want to try it on,” Matvey understood, but he only said,
“Yes, sir.”
Stepan Arkadyevitch was already washed and combed and ready to be dressed, when
Matvey, stepping deliberately in his creaky boots, came back into the room with
the telegram in his hand. The barber had gone.
“Darya Alexandrovna told me to inform you that she is going away. Let him
do—that is you—as he likes,” he said, laughing only with his
eyes, and putting his hands in his pockets, he watched his master with his head
on one side. Stepan Arkadyevitch was silent a minute. Then a good-humored and
rather pitiful smile showed itself on his handsome face.
“Eh, Matvey?” he said, shaking his head.
“It’s all right, sir; she will come round,” said Matvey.
“Come round?”
“Yes, sir.”
“Do you think so? Who’s there?” asked Stepan Arkadyevitch,
hearing the rustle of a woman’s dress at the door.
“It’s I,” said a firm, pleasant, woman’s voice, and the
stern, pockmarked face of Matrona Philimonovna, the nurse, was thrust in at the
doorway.
“Well, what is it, Matrona?” queried Stepan Arkadyevitch, going up
to her at the door.
Although Stepan Arkadyevitch was completely in the wrong as regards his wife,
and was conscious of this himself, almost everyone in the house (even the
nurse, Darya Alexandrovna’s chief ally) was on his side.
“Well, what now?” he asked disconsolately.
“Go to her, sir; own your fault again. Maybe God will aid you. She is
suffering so, it’s sad to see her; and besides, everything in the house
is topsy-turvy. You must have pity, sir, on the children. Beg her forgiveness,
sir. There’s no help for it! One must take the consequences....”
“But she won’t see me.”
“You do your part. God is merciful; pray to God, sir, pray to God.”
“Come, that’ll do, you can go,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch,
blushing suddenly. “Well now, do dress me.” He turned to Matvey and
threw off his dressing-gown decisively.
Matvey was already holding up the shirt like a horse’s collar, and,
blowing off some invisible speck, he slipped it with obvious pleasure over the
well-groomed body of his master.
When he was dressed, Stepan Arkadyevitch sprinkled some scent on himself,
pulled down his shirt-cuffs, distributed into his pockets his cigarettes,
pocketbook, matches, and watch with its double chain and seals, and shaking out
his handkerchief, feeling himself clean, fragrant, healthy, and physically at
ease, in spite of his unhappiness, he walked with a slight swing on each leg
into the dining-room, where coffee was already waiting for him, and beside the
coffee, letters and papers from the office.
He read the letters. One was very unpleasant, from a merchant who was buying a
forest on his wife’s property. To sell this forest was absolutely
essential; but at present, until he was reconciled with his wife, the subject
could not be discussed. The most unpleasant thing of all was that his pecuniary
interests should in this way enter into the question of his reconciliation with
his wife. And the idea that he might be led on by his interests, that he might
seek a reconciliation with his wife on account of the sale of the
forest—that idea hurt him.
When he had finished his letters, Stepan Arkadyevitch moved the office-papers
close to him, rapidly looked through two pieces of business, made a few notes
with a big pencil, and pushing away the papers, turned to his coffee. As he
sipped his coffee, he opened a still damp morning paper, and began reading it.
Stepan Arkadyevitch took in and read a liberal paper, not an extreme one, but
one advocating the views held by the majority. And in spite of the fact that
science, art, and politics had no special interest for him, he firmly held
those views on all these subjects which were held by the majority and by his
paper, and he only changed them when the majority changed them—or, more
strictly speaking, he did not change them, but they imperceptibly changed of
themselves within him.
Stepan Arkadyevitch had not chosen his political opinions or his views; these
political opinions and views had come to him of themselves, just as he did not
choose the shapes of his hat and coat, but simply took those that were being
worn. And for him, living in a certain society—owing to the need,
ordinarily developed at years of discretion, for some degree of mental
activity—to have views was just as indispensable as to have a hat. If
there was a reason for his preferring liberal to conservative views, which were
held also by many of his circle, it arose not from his considering liberalism
more rational, but from its being in closer accordance with his manner of life.
The liberal party said that in Russia everything is wrong, and certainly Stepan
Arkadyevitch had many debts and was decidedly short of money. The liberal party
said that marriage is an institution quite out of date, and that it needs
reconstruction; and family life certainly afforded Stepan Arkadyevitch little
gratification, and forced him into lying and hypocrisy, which was so repulsive
to his nature. The liberal party said, or rather allowed it to be understood,
that religion is only a curb to keep in check the barbarous classes of the
people; and Stepan Arkadyevitch could not get through even a short service
without his legs aching from standing up, and could never make out what was the
object of all the terrible and high-flown language about another world when
life might be so very amusing in this world. And with all this, Stepan
Arkadyevitch, who liked a joke, was fond of puzzling a plain man by saying that
if he prided himself on his origin, he ought not to stop at Rurik and disown
the first founder of his family—the monkey. And so Liberalism had become
a habit of Stepan Arkadyevitch’s, and he liked his newspaper, as he did
his cigar after dinner, for the slight fog it diffused in his brain. He read
the leading article, in which it was maintained that it was quite senseless in
our day to raise an outcry that radicalism was threatening to swallow up all
conservative elements, and that the government ought to take measures to crush
the revolutionary hydra; that, on the contrary, “in our opinion the
danger lies not in that fantastic revolutionary hydra, but in the obstinacy of
traditionalism clogging progress,” etc., etc. He read another article,
too, a financial one, which alluded to Bentham and Mill, and dropped some
innuendoes reflecting on the ministry. With his characteristic quickwittedness
he caught the drift of each innuendo, divined whence it came, at whom and on
what ground it was aimed, and that afforded him, as it always did, a certain
satisfaction. But today that satisfaction was embittered by Matrona
Philimonovna’s advice and the unsatisfactory state of the household. He
read, too, that Count Beist was rumored to have left for Wiesbaden, and that
one need have no more gray hair, and of the sale of a light carriage, and of a
young person seeking a situation; but these items of information did not give
him, as usual, a quiet, ironical gratification. Having finished the paper, a
second cup of coffee and a roll and butter, he got up, shaking the crumbs of
the roll off his waistcoat; and, squaring his broad chest, he smiled joyously:
not because there was anything particularly agreeable in his mind—the
joyous smile was evoked by a good digestion.
But this joyous smile at once recalled everything to him, and he grew
thoughtful.
Two childish voices (Stepan Arkadyevitch recognized the voices of Grisha, his
youngest boy, and Tanya, his eldest girl) were heard outside the door. They
were carrying something, and dropped it.
“I told you not to sit passengers on the roof,” said the little
girl in English; “there, pick them up!”
“Everything’s in confusion,” thought Stepan Arkadyevitch;
“there are the children running about by themselves.” And going to
the door, he called them. They threw down the box, that represented a train,
and came in to their father.
The little girl, her father’s favorite, ran up boldly, embraced him, and
hung laughingly on his neck, enjoying as she always did the smell of scent that
came from his whiskers. At last the little girl kissed his face, which was
flushed from his stooping posture and beaming with tenderness, loosed her
hands, and was about to run away again; but her father held her back.
“How is mamma?” he asked, passing his hand over his
daughter’s smooth, soft little neck. “Good morning,” he said,
smiling to the boy, who had come up to greet him. He was conscious that he
loved the boy less, and always tried to be fair; but the boy felt it, and did
not respond with a smile to his father’s chilly smile.
“Mamma? She is up,” answered the girl.
Stepan Arkadyevitch sighed. “That means that she’s not slept again
all night,” he thought.
“Well, is she cheerful?”
The little girl knew that there was a quarrel between her father and mother,
and that her mother could not be cheerful, and that her father must be aware of
this, and that he was pretending when he asked about it so lightly. And she
blushed for her father. He at once perceived it, and blushed too.
“I don’t know,” she said. “She did not say we must do
our lessons, but she said we were to go for a walk with Miss Hoole to
grandmamma’s.”
“Well, go, Tanya, my darling. Oh, wait a minute, though,” he said,
still holding her and stroking her soft little hand.
He took off the mantelpiece, where he had put it yesterday, a little box of
sweets, and gave her two, picking out her favorites, a chocolate and a fondant.
“For Grisha?” said the little girl, pointing to the chocolate.
“Yes, yes.” And still stroking her little shoulder, he kissed her
on the roots of her hair and neck, and let her go.
“The carriage is ready,” said Matvey; “but there’s
someone to see you with a petition.”
“Been here long?” asked Stepan Arkadyevitch.
“Half an hour.”
“How many times have I told you to tell me at once?”
“One must let you drink your coffee in peace, at least,” said
Matvey, in the affectionately gruff tone with which it was impossible to be
angry.
“Well, show the person up at once,” said Oblonsky, frowning with
vexation.
The petitioner, the widow of a staff captain Kalinin, came with a request
impossible and unreasonable; but Stepan Arkadyevitch, as he generally did, made
her sit down, heard her to the end attentively without interrupting her, and
gave her detailed advice as to how and to whom to apply, and even wrote her, in
his large, sprawling, good and legible hand, a confident and fluent little note
to a personage who might be of use to her. Having got rid of the staff
captain’s widow, Stepan Arkadyevitch took his hat and stopped to
recollect whether he had forgotten anything. It appeared that he had forgotten
nothing except what he wanted to forget—his wife.
“Ah, yes!” He bowed his head, and his handsome face assumed a
harassed expression. “To go, or not to go!” he said to himself; and
an inner voice told him he must not go, that nothing could come of it but
falsity; that to amend, to set right their relations was impossible, because it
was impossible to make her attractive again and able to inspire love, or to
make him an old man, not susceptible to love. Except deceit and lying nothing
could come of it now; and deceit and lying were opposed to his nature.
“It must be some time, though: it can’t go on like this,” he
said, trying to give himself courage. He squared his chest, took out a
cigarette, took two whiffs at it, flung it into a mother-of-pearl ashtray, and
with rapid steps walked through the drawing-room, and opened the other door
into his wife’s bedroom.
Darya Alexandrovna, in a dressing jacket, and with her now scanty, once
luxuriant and beautiful hair fastened up with hairpins on the nape of her neck,
with a sunken, thin face and large, startled eyes, which looked prominent from
the thinness of her face, was standing among a litter of all sorts of things
scattered all over the room, before an open bureau, from which she was taking
something. Hearing her husband’s steps, she stopped, looking towards the
door, and trying assiduously to give her features a severe and contemptuous
expression. She felt she was afraid of him, and afraid of the coming interview.
She was just attempting to do what she had attempted to do ten times already in
these last three days—to sort out the children’s things and her
own, so as to take them to her mother’s—and again she could not
bring herself to do this; but now again, as each time before, she kept saying
to herself, “that things cannot go on like this, that she must take some
step” to punish him, put him to shame, avenge on him some little part at
least of the suffering he had caused her. She still continued to tell herself
that she should leave him, but she was conscious that this was impossible; it
was impossible because she could not get out of the habit of regarding him as
her husband and loving him. Besides this, she realized that if even here in her
own house she could hardly manage to look after her five children properly,
they would be still worse off where she was going with them all. As it was,
even in the course of these three days, the youngest was unwell from being
given unwholesome soup, and the others had almost gone without their dinner the
day before. She was conscious that it was impossible to go away; but, cheating
herself, she went on all the same sorting out her things and pretending she was
going.
Seeing her husband, she dropped her hands into the drawer of the bureau as
though looking for something, and only looked round at him when he had come
quite up to her. But her face, to which she tried to give a severe and resolute
expression, betrayed bewilderment and suffering.
“Dolly!” he said in a subdued and timid voice. He bent his head
towards his shoulder and tried to look pitiful and humble, but for all that he
was radiant with freshness and health. In a rapid glance she scanned his figure
that beamed with health and freshness. “Yes, he is happy and
content!” she thought; “while I.... And that disgusting good
nature, which everyone likes him for and praises—I hate that good nature
of his,” she thought. Her mouth stiffened, the muscles of the cheek
contracted on the right side of her pale, nervous face.
“What do you want?” she said in a rapid, deep, unnatural voice.
“Dolly!” he repeated, with a quiver in his voice. “Anna is
coming today.”
“Well, what is that to me? I can’t see her!” she cried.
“But you must, really, Dolly....”
“Go away, go away, go away!” she shrieked, not looking at him, as
though this shriek were called up by physical pain.
Stepan Arkadyevitch could be calm when he thought of his wife, he could hope
that she would come round, as Matvey expressed it, and could quietly go
on reading his paper and drinking his coffee; but when he saw her tortured,
suffering face, heard the tone of her voice, submissive to fate and full of
despair, there was a catch in his breath and a lump in his throat, and his eyes
began to shine with tears.
“My God! what have I done? Dolly! For God’s sake!... You
know....” He could not go on; there was a sob in his throat.
She shut the bureau with a slam, and glanced at him.
“Dolly, what can I say?... One thing: forgive.... Remember, cannot nine
years of my life atone for an instant....”
She dropped her eyes and listened, expecting what he would say, as it were
beseeching him in some way or other to make her believe differently.
“—instant of passion?” he said, and would have gone on, but
at that word, as at a pang of physical pain, her lips stiffened again, and
again the muscles of her right cheek worked.
“Go away, go out of the room!” she shrieked still more shrilly,
“and don’t talk to me of your passion and your
loathsomeness.”
She tried to go out, but tottered, and clung to the back of a chair to support
herself. His face relaxed, his lips swelled, his eyes were swimming with tears.
“Dolly!” he said, sobbing now; “for mercy’s sake, think
of the children; they are not to blame! I am to blame, and punish me, make me
expiate my fault. Anything I can do, I am ready to do anything! I am to blame,
no words can express how much I am to blame! But, Dolly, forgive me!”
She sat down. He listened to her hard, heavy breathing, and he was unutterably
sorry for her. She tried several times to begin to speak, but could not. He
waited.
“You remember the children, Stiva, to play with them; but I remember
them, and know that this means their ruin,” she said—obviously one
of the phrases she had more than once repeated to herself in the course of the
last few days.
She had called him “Stiva,” and he glanced at her with gratitude,
and moved to take her hand, but she drew back from him with aversion.
“I think of the children, and for that reason I would do anything in the
world to save them, but I don’t myself know how to save them. By taking
them away from their father, or by leaving them with a vicious
father—yes, a vicious father.... Tell me, after what ... has happened,
can we live together? Is that possible? Tell me, eh, is it possible?” she
repeated, raising her voice, “after my husband, the father of my
children, enters into a love affair with his own children’s
governess?”
“But what could I do? what could I do?” he kept saying in a pitiful
voice, not knowing what he was saying, as his head sank lower and lower.
“You are loathsome to me, repulsive!” she shrieked, getting more
and more heated. “Your tears mean nothing! You have never loved me; you
have neither heart nor honorable feeling! You are hateful to me, disgusting, a
stranger—yes, a complete stranger!” With pain and wrath she uttered
the word so terrible to herself—stranger.
He looked at her, and the fury expressed in her face alarmed and amazed him. He
did not understand how his pity for her exasperated her. She saw in him
sympathy for her, but not love. “No, she hates me. She will not forgive
me,” he thought.
“It is awful! awful!” he said.
At that moment in the next room a child began to cry; probably it had fallen
down. Darya Alexandrovna listened, and her face suddenly softened.
She seemed to be pulling herself together for a few seconds, as though she did
not know where she was, and what she was doing, and getting up rapidly, she
moved towards the door.
“Well, she loves my child,” he thought, noticing the change of her
face at the child’s cry, “my child: how can she hate me?”
“Dolly, one word more,” he said, following her.
“If you come near me, I will call in the servants, the children! They may
all know you are a scoundrel! I am going away at once, and you may live here
with your mistress!”
And she went out, slamming the door.
Stepan Arkadyevitch sighed, wiped his face, and with a subdued tread walked out
of the room. “Matvey says she will come round; but how? I don’t see
the least chance of it. Ah, oh, how horrible it is! And how vulgarly she
shouted,” he said to himself, remembering her shriek and the
words—“scoundrel” and “mistress.” “And very
likely the maids were listening! Horribly vulgar! horrible!” Stepan
Arkadyevitch stood a few seconds alone, wiped his face, squared his chest, and
walked out of the room.
It was Friday, and in the dining-room the German watchmaker was winding up the
clock. Stepan Arkadyevitch remembered his joke about this punctual, bald
watchmaker, “that the German was wound up for a whole lifetime himself,
to wind up watches,” and he smiled. Stepan Arkadyevitch was fond of a
joke: “And maybe she will come round! That’s a good expression,
‘come round,’” he thought. “I must repeat
that.”
“Matvey!” he shouted. “Arrange everything with Darya in the
sitting room for Anna Arkadyevna,” he said to Matvey when he came in.
“Yes, sir.”
Stepan Arkadyevitch put on his fur coat and went out onto the steps.
“You won’t dine at home?” said Matvey, seeing him off.
“That’s as it happens. But here’s for the
housekeeping,” he said, taking ten roubles from his pocketbook.
“That’ll be enough.”
“Enough or not enough, we must make it do,” said Matvey, slamming
the carriage door and stepping back onto the steps.
Darya Alexandrovna meanwhile having pacified the child, and knowing from the
sound of the carriage that he had gone off, went back again to her bedroom. It
was her solitary refuge from the household cares which crowded upon her
directly she went out from it. Even now, in the short time she had been in the
nursery, the English governess and Matrona Philimonovna had succeeded in
putting several questions to her, which did not admit of delay, and which only
she could answer: “What were the children to put on for their walk?
Should they have any milk? Should not a new cook be sent for?”
“Ah, let me alone, let me alone!” she said, and going back to her
bedroom she sat down in the same place as she had sat when talking to her
husband, clasping tightly her thin hands with the rings that slipped down on
her bony fingers, and fell to going over in her memory all the conversation.
“He has gone! But has he broken it off with her?” she thought.
“Can it be he sees her? Why didn’t I ask him! No, no,
reconciliation is impossible. Even if we remain in the same house, we are
strangers—strangers forever!” She repeated again with special
significance the word so dreadful to her. “And how I loved him! my God,
how I loved him!... How I loved him! And now don’t I love him?
Don’t I love him more than before? The most horrible thing is,” she
began, but did not finish her thought, because Matrona Philimonovna put her
head in at the door.
“Let us send for my brother,” she said; “he can get a dinner
anyway, or we shall have the children getting nothing to eat till six again,
like yesterday.”
“Very well, I will come directly and see about it. But did you send for
some new milk?”
And Darya Alexandrovna plunged into the duties of the day, and drowned her
grief in them for a time.
Stepan Arkadyevitch had learned easily at school, thanks to his excellent
abilities, but he had been idle and mischievous, and therefore was one of the
lowest in his class. But in spite of his habitually dissipated mode of life,
his inferior grade in the service, and his comparative youth, he occupied the
honorable and lucrative position of president of one of the government boards
at Moscow. This post he had received through his sister Anna’s husband,
Alexey Alexandrovitch Karenin, who held one of the most important positions in
the ministry to whose department the Moscow office belonged. But if Karenin had
not got his brother-in-law this berth, then through a hundred other
personages—brothers, sisters, cousins, uncles, and aunts—Stiva
Oblonsky would have received this post, or some other similar one, together
with the salary of six thousand absolutely needful for him, as his affairs, in
spite of his wife’s considerable property, were in an embarrassed
condition.
Half Moscow and Petersburg were friends and relations of Stepan Arkadyevitch.
He was born in the midst of those who had been and are the powerful ones of
this world. One-third of the men in the government, the older men, had been
friends of his father’s, and had known him in petticoats; another third
were his intimate chums, and the remainder were friendly acquaintances.
Consequently the distributors of earthly blessings in the shape of places,
rents, shares, and such, were all his friends, and could not overlook one of
their own set; and Oblonsky had no need to make any special exertion to get a
lucrative post. He had only not to refuse things, not to show jealousy, not to
be quarrelsome or take offense, all of which from his characteristic good
nature he never did. It would have struck him as absurd if he had been told
that he would not get a position with the salary he required, especially as he
expected nothing out of the way; he only wanted what the men of his own age and
standing did get, and he was no worse qualified for performing duties of the
kind than any other man.
Stepan Arkadyevitch was not merely liked by all who knew him for his good
humor, but for his bright disposition, and his unquestionable honesty. In him,
in his handsome, radiant figure, his sparkling eyes, black hair and eyebrows,
and the white and red of his face, there was something which produced a
physical effect of kindliness and good humor on the people who met him.
“Aha! Stiva! Oblonsky! Here he is!” was almost always said with a
smile of delight on meeting him. Even though it happened at times that after a
conversation with him it seemed that nothing particularly delightful had
happened, the next day, and the next, everyone was just as delighted at meeting
him again.
After filling for three years the post of president of one of the government
boards at Moscow, Stepan Arkadyevitch had won the respect, as well as the
liking, of his fellow-officials, subordinates, and superiors, and all who had
had business with him. The principal qualities in Stepan Arkadyevitch which had
gained him this universal respect in the service consisted, in the first place,
of his extreme indulgence for others, founded on a consciousness of his own
shortcomings; secondly, of his perfect liberalism—not the liberalism he
read of in the papers, but the liberalism that was in his blood, in virtue of
which he treated all men perfectly equally and exactly the same, whatever their
fortune or calling might be; and thirdly—the most important
point—his complete indifference to the business in which he was engaged,
in consequence of which he was never carried away, and never made mistakes.
On reaching the offices of the board, Stepan Arkadyevitch, escorted by a
deferential porter with a portfolio, went into his little private room, put on
his uniform, and went into the boardroom. The clerks and copyists all rose,
greeting him with good-humored deference. Stepan Arkadyevitch moved quickly, as
ever, to his place, shook hands with his colleagues, and sat down. He made a
joke or two, and talked just as much as was consistent with due decorum, and
began work. No one knew better than Stepan Arkadyevitch how to hit on the exact
line between freedom, simplicity, and official stiffness necessary for the
agreeable conduct of business. A secretary, with the good-humored deference
common to everyone in Stepan Arkadyevitch’s office, came up with papers,
and began to speak in the familiar and easy tone which had been introduced by
Stepan Arkadyevitch.
“We have succeeded in getting the information from the government
department of Penza. Here, would you care?...”
“You’ve got them at last?” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, laying
his finger on the paper. “Now, gentlemen....”
And the sitting of the board began.
“If they knew,” he thought, bending his head with a significant air
as he listened to the report, “what a guilty little boy their president
was half an hour ago.” And his eyes were laughing during the reading of
the report. Till two o’clock the sitting would go on without a break, and
at two o’clock there would be an interval and luncheon.
It was not yet two, when the large glass doors of the boardroom suddenly opened
and someone came in.
All the officials sitting on the further side under the portrait of the Tsar
and the eagle, delighted at any distraction, looked round at the door; but the
doorkeeper standing at the door at once drove out the intruder, and closed the
glass door after him.
When the case had been read through, Stepan Arkadyevitch got up and stretched,
and by way of tribute to the liberalism of the times took out a cigarette in
the boardroom and went into his private room. Two of the members of the board,
the old veteran in the service, Nikitin, and the Kammerjunker
Grinevitch, went in with him.
“We shall have time to finish after lunch,” said Stepan
Arkadyevitch.
“To be sure we shall!” said Nikitin.
“A pretty sharp fellow this Fomin must be,” said Grinevitch of one
of the persons taking part in the case they were examining.
Stepan Arkadyevitch frowned at Grinevitch’s words, giving him thereby to
understand that it was improper to pass judgment prematurely, and made him no
reply.
“Who was that came in?” he asked the doorkeeper.
“Someone, your excellency, crept in without permission directly my back
was turned. He was asking for you. I told him: when the members come out,
then....”
“Where is he?”
“Maybe he’s gone into the passage, but here he comes anyway. That
is he,” said the doorkeeper, pointing to a strongly built,
broad-shouldered man with a curly beard, who, without taking off his sheepskin
cap, was running lightly and rapidly up the worn steps of the stone staircase.
One of the members going down—a lean official with a
portfolio—stood out of his way and looked disapprovingly at the legs of
the stranger, then glanced inquiringly at Oblonsky.
Stepan Arkadyevitch was standing at the top of the stairs. His good-naturedly
beaming face above the embroidered collar of his uniform beamed more than ever
when he recognized the man coming up.
“Why, it’s actually you, Levin, at last!” he said with a
friendly mocking smile, scanning Levin as he approached. “How is it you
have deigned to look me up in this den?” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, and
not content with shaking hands, he kissed his friend. “Have you been here
long?”
“I have just come, and very much wanted to see you,” said Levin,
looking shyly and at the same time angrily and uneasily around.
“Well, let’s go into my room,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, who
knew his friend’s sensitive and irritable shyness, and, taking his arm,
he drew him along, as though guiding him through dangers.
Stepan Arkadyevitch was on familiar terms with almost all his acquaintances,
and called almost all of them by their Christian names: old men of sixty, boys
of twenty, actors, ministers, merchants, and adjutant-generals, so that many of
his intimate chums were to be found at the extreme ends of the social ladder,
and would have been very much surprised to learn that they had, through the
medium of Oblonsky, something in common. He was the familiar friend of everyone
with whom he took a glass of champagne, and he took a glass of champagne with
everyone, and when in consequence he met any of his disreputable chums, as he
used in joke to call many of his friends, in the presence of his subordinates,
he well knew how, with his characteristic tact, to diminish the disagreeable
impression made on them. Levin was not a disreputable chum, but Oblonsky, with
his ready tact, felt that Levin fancied he might not care to show his intimacy
with him before his subordinates, and so he made haste to take him off into his
room.
Levin was almost of the same age as Oblonsky; their intimacy did not rest
merely on champagne. Levin had been the friend and companion of his early
youth. They were fond of one another in spite of the difference of their
characters and tastes, as friends are fond of one another who have been
together in early youth. But in spite of this, each of them—as is often
the way with men who have selected careers of different kinds—though in
discussion he would even justify the other’s career, in his heart
despised it. It seemed to each of them that the life he led himself was the
only real life, and the life led by his friend was a mere phantasm. Oblonsky
could not restrain a slight mocking smile at the sight of Levin. How often he
had seen him come up to Moscow from the country where he was doing something,
but what precisely Stepan Arkadyevitch could never quite make out, and indeed
he took no interest in the matter. Levin arrived in Moscow always excited and
in a hurry, rather ill at ease and irritated by his own want of ease, and for
the most part with a perfectly new, unexpected view of things. Stepan
Arkadyevitch laughed at this, and liked it. In the same way Levin in his heart
despised the town mode of life of his friend, and his official duties, which he
laughed at, and regarded as trifling. But the difference was that Oblonsky, as
he was doing the same as everyone did, laughed complacently and good-humoredly,
while Levin laughed without complacency and sometimes angrily.
“We have long been expecting you,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, going
into his room and letting Levin’s hand go as though to show that here all
danger was over. “I am very, very glad to see you,” he went on.
“Well, how are you? Eh? When did you come?”
Levin was silent, looking at the unknown faces of Oblonsky’s two
companions, and especially at the hand of the elegant Grinevitch, which had
such long white fingers, such long yellow filbert-shaped nails, and such huge
shining studs on the shirt-cuff, that apparently they absorbed all his
attention, and allowed him no freedom of thought. Oblonsky noticed this at
once, and smiled.
“Ah, to be sure, let me introduce you,” he said. “My
colleagues: Philip Ivanitch Nikitin, Mihail Stanislavitch
Grinevitch”—and turning to Levin—“a district councilor,
a modern district councilman, a gymnast who lifts thirteen stone with one hand,
a cattle-breeder and sportsman, and my friend, Konstantin Dmitrievitch Levin,
the brother of Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev.”
“Delighted,” said the veteran.
“I have the honor of knowing your brother, Sergey Ivanovitch,” said
Grinevitch, holding out his slender hand with its long nails.
Levin frowned, shook hands coldly, and at once turned to Oblonsky. Though he
had a great respect for his half-brother, an author well known to all Russia,
he could not endure it when people treated him not as Konstantin Levin, but as
the brother of the celebrated Koznishev.
“No, I am no longer a district councilor. I have quarreled with them all,
and don’t go to the meetings any more,” he said, turning to
Oblonsky.
“You’ve been quick about it!” said Oblonsky with a smile.
“But how? why?”
“It’s a long story. I will tell you some time,” said Levin,
but he began telling him at once. “Well, to put it shortly, I was
convinced that nothing was really done by the district councils, or ever could
be,” he began, as though someone had just insulted him. “On one
side it’s a plaything; they play at being a parliament, and I’m
neither young enough nor old enough to find amusement in playthings; and on the
other side” (he stammered) “it’s a means for the coterie of
the district to make money. Formerly they had wardships, courts of justice, now
they have the district council—not in the form of bribes, but in the form
of unearned salary,” he said, as hotly as though someone of those present
had opposed his opinion.
“Aha! You’re in a new phase again, I see—a
conservative,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch. “However, we can go into
that later.”
“Yes, later. But I wanted to see you,” said Levin, looking with
hatred at Grinevitch’s hand.
Stepan Arkadyevitch gave a scarcely perceptible smile.
“How was it you used to say you would never wear European dress
again?” he said, scanning his new suit, obviously cut by a French tailor.
“Ah! I see: a new phase.”
Levin suddenly blushed, not as grown men blush, slightly, without being
themselves aware of it, but as boys blush, feeling that they are ridiculous
through their shyness, and consequently ashamed of it and blushing still more,
almost to the point of tears. And it was so strange to see this sensible, manly
face in such a childish plight, that Oblonsky left off looking at him.
“Oh, where shall we meet? You know I want very much to talk to
you,” said Levin.
Oblonsky seemed to ponder.
“I’ll tell you what: let’s go to Gurin’s to lunch, and
there we can talk. I am free till three.”
“No,” answered Levin, after an instant’s thought, “I
have got to go on somewhere else.”
“All right, then, let’s dine together.”
“Dine together? But I have nothing very particular, only a few words to
say, and a question I want to ask you, and we can have a talk
afterwards.”
“Well, say the few words, then, at once, and we’ll gossip after
dinner.”
“Well, it’s this,” said Levin; “but it’s of no
importance, though.”
His face all at once took an expression of anger from the effort he was making
to surmount his shyness.
“What are the Shtcherbatskys doing? Everything as it used to be?”
he said.
Stepan Arkadyevitch, who had long known that Levin was in love with his
sister-in-law, Kitty, gave a hardly perceptible smile, and his eyes sparkled
merrily.
“You said a few words, but I can’t answer in a few words,
because.... Excuse me a minute....”
A secretary came in, with respectful familiarity and the modest consciousness,
characteristic of every secretary, of superiority to his chief in the knowledge
of their business; he went up to Oblonsky with some papers, and began, under
pretense of asking a question, to explain some objection. Stepan Arkadyevitch,
without hearing him out, laid his hand genially on the secretary’s
sleeve.
“No, you do as I told you,” he said, softening his words with a
smile, and with a brief explanation of his view of the matter he turned away
from the papers, and said: “So do it that way, if you please, Zahar
Nikititch.”
The secretary retired in confusion. During the consultation with the secretary
Levin had completely recovered from his embarrassment. He was standing with his
elbows on the back of a chair, and on his face was a look of ironical
attention.
“I don’t understand it, I don’t understand it,” he
said.
“What don’t you understand?” said Oblonsky, smiling as
brightly as ever, and picking up a cigarette. He expected some queer outburst
from Levin.
“I don’t understand what you are doing,” said Levin,
shrugging his shoulders. “How can you do it seriously?”
“Why not?”
“Why, because there’s nothing in it.”
“You think so, but we’re overwhelmed with work.”
“On paper. But, there, you’ve a gift for it,” added Levin.
“That’s to say, you think there’s a lack of something in
me?”
“Perhaps so,” said Levin. “But all the same I admire your
grandeur, and am proud that I’ve a friend in such a great person.
You’ve not answered my question, though,” he went on, with a
desperate effort looking Oblonsky straight in the face.
“Oh, that’s all very well. You wait a bit, and you’ll come to
this yourself. It’s very nice for you to have over six thousand acres in
the Karazinsky district, and such muscles, and the freshness of a girl of
twelve; still you’ll be one of us one day. Yes, as to your question,
there is no change, but it’s a pity you’ve been away so
long.”
“Oh, why so?” Levin queried, panic-stricken.
“Oh, nothing,” responded Oblonsky. “We’ll talk it over.
But what’s brought you up to town?”
“Oh, we’ll talk about that, too, later on,” said Levin,
reddening again up to his ears.
“All right. I see,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch. “I should ask
you to come to us, you know, but my wife’s not quite the thing. But I
tell you what; if you want to see them, they’re sure now to be at the
Zoological Gardens from four to five. Kitty skates. You drive along there, and
I’ll come and fetch you, and we’ll go and dine somewhere
together.”
“Capital. So good-bye till then.”
“Now mind, you’ll forget, I know you, or rush off home to the
country!” Stepan Arkadyevitch called out laughing.
“No, truly!”
And Levin went out of the room, only when he was in the doorway remembering
that he had forgotten to take leave of Oblonsky’s colleagues.
“That gentleman must be a man of great energy,” said Grinevitch,
when Levin had gone away.
“Yes, my dear boy,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, nodding his head,
“he’s a lucky fellow! Over six thousand acres in the Karazinsky
district; everything before him; and what youth and vigor! Not like some of
us.”
“You have a great deal to complain of, haven’t you, Stepan
Arkadyevitch?”
“Ah, yes, I’m in a poor way, a bad way,” said Stepan
Arkadyevitch with a heavy sigh.
When Oblonsky asked Levin what had brought him to town, Levin blushed, and was
furious with himself for blushing, because he could not answer, “I have
come to make your sister-in-law an offer,” though that was precisely what
he had come for.
The families of the Levins and the Shtcherbatskys were old, noble Moscow
families, and had always been on intimate and friendly terms. This intimacy had
grown still closer during Levin’s student days. He had both prepared for
the university with the young Prince Shtcherbatsky, the brother of Kitty and
Dolly, and had entered at the same time with him. In those days Levin used
often to be in the Shtcherbatskys’ house, and he was in love with the
Shtcherbatsky household. Strange as it may appear, it was with the household,
the family, that Konstantin Levin was in love, especially with the feminine
half of the household. Levin did not remember his own mother, and his only
sister was older than he was, so that it was in the Shtcherbatskys’ house
that he saw for the first time that inner life of an old, noble, cultivated,
and honorable family of which he had been deprived by the death of his father
and mother. All the members of that family, especially the feminine half, were
pictured by him, as it were, wrapped about with a mysterious poetical veil, and
he not only perceived no defects whatever in them, but under the poetical veil
that shrouded them he assumed the existence of the loftiest sentiments and
every possible perfection. Why it was the three young ladies had one day to
speak French, and the next English; why it was that at certain hours they
played by turns on the piano, the sounds of which were audible in their
brother’s room above, where the students used to work; why they were
visited by those professors of French literature, of music, of drawing, of
dancing; why at certain hours all the three young ladies, with Mademoiselle
Linon, drove in the coach to the Tversky boulevard, dressed in their satin
cloaks, Dolly in a long one, Natalia in a half-long one, and Kitty in one so
short that her shapely legs in tightly-drawn red stockings were visible to all
beholders; why it was they had to walk about the Tversky boulevard escorted by
a footman with a gold cockade in his hat—all this and much more that was
done in their mysterious world he did not understand, but he was sure that
everything that was done there was very good, and he was in love precisely with
the mystery of the proceedings.
In his student days he had all but been in love with the eldest, Dolly, but she
was soon married to Oblonsky. Then he began being in love with the second. He
felt, as it were, that he had to be in love with one of the sisters, only he
could not quite make out which. But Natalia, too, had hardly made her
appearance in the world when she married the diplomat Lvov. Kitty was still a
child when Levin left the university. Young Shtcherbatsky went into the navy,
was drowned in the Baltic, and Levin’s relations with the Shtcherbatskys,
in spite of his friendship with Oblonsky, became less intimate. But when early
in the winter of this year Levin came to Moscow, after a year in the country,
and saw the Shtcherbatskys, he realized which of the three sisters he was
indeed destined to love.
One would have thought that nothing could be simpler than for him, a man of
good family, rather rich than poor, and thirty-two years old, to make the young
Princess Shtcherbatskaya an offer of marriage; in all likelihood he would at
once have been looked upon as a good match. But Levin was in love, and so it
seemed to him that Kitty was so perfect in every respect that she was a
creature far above everything earthly; and that he was a creature so low and so
earthly that it could not even be conceived that other people and she herself
could regard him as worthy of her.
After spending two months in Moscow in a state of enchantment, seeing Kitty
almost every day in society, into which he went so as to meet her, he abruptly
decided that it could not be, and went back to the country.
Levin’s conviction that it could not be was founded on the idea that in
the eyes of her family he was a disadvantageous and worthless match for the
charming Kitty, and that Kitty herself could not love him. In her
family’s eyes he had no ordinary, definite career and position in
society, while his contemporaries by this time, when he was thirty-two, were
already, one a colonel, and another a professor, another director of a bank and
railways, or president of a board like Oblonsky. But he (he knew very well how
he must appear to others) was a country gentleman, occupied in breeding cattle,
shooting game, and building barns; in other words, a fellow of no ability, who
had not turned out well, and who was doing just what, according to the ideas of
the world, is done by people fit for nothing else.
The mysterious, enchanting Kitty herself could not love such an ugly person as
he conceived himself to be, and, above all, such an ordinary, in no way
striking person. Moreover, his attitude to Kitty in the past—the attitude
of a grown-up person to a child, arising from his friendship with her
brother—seemed to him yet another obstacle to love. An ugly, good-natured
man, as he considered himself, might, he supposed, be liked as a friend; but to
be loved with such a love as that with which he loved Kitty, one would need to
be a handsome and, still more, a distinguished man.
He had heard that women often did care for ugly and ordinary men, but he did
not believe it, for he judged by himself, and he could not himself have loved
any but beautiful, mysterious, and exceptional women.
But after spending two months alone in the country, he was convinced that this
was not one of those passions of which he had had experience in his early
youth; that this feeling gave him not an instant’s rest; that he could
not live without deciding the question, would she or would she not be his wife,
and that his despair had arisen only from his own imaginings, that he had no
sort of proof that he would be rejected. And he had now come to Moscow with a
firm determination to make an offer, and get married if he were accepted. Or
... he could not conceive what would become of him if he were rejected.
On arriving in Moscow by a morning train, Levin had put up at the house of his
elder half-brother, Koznishev. After changing his clothes he went down to his
brother’s study, intending to talk to him at once about the object of his
visit, and to ask his advice; but his brother was not alone. With him there was
a well-known professor of philosophy, who had come from Harkov expressly to
clear up a difference that had arisen between them on a very important
philosophical question. The professor was carrying on a hot crusade against
materialists. Sergey Koznishev had been following this crusade with interest,
and after reading the professor’s last article, he had written him a
letter stating his objections. He accused the professor of making too great
concessions to the materialists. And the professor had promptly appeared to
argue the matter out. The point in discussion was the question then in vogue:
Is there a line to be drawn between psychological and physiological phenomena
in man? and if so, where?
Sergey Ivanovitch met his brother with the smile of chilly friendliness he
always had for everyone, and introducing him to the professor, went on with the
conversation.
A little man in spectacles, with a narrow forehead, tore himself from the
discussion for an instant to greet Levin, and then went on talking without
paying any further attention to him. Levin sat down to wait till the professor
should go, but he soon began to get interested in the subject under discussion.
Levin had come across the magazine articles about which they were disputing,
and had read them, interested in them as a development of the first principles
of science, familiar to him as a natural science student at the university. But
he had never connected these scientific deductions as to the origin of man as
an animal, as to reflex action, biology, and sociology, with those questions as
to the meaning of life and death to himself, which had of late been more and
more often in his mind.
As he listened to his brother’s argument with the professor, he noticed
that they connected these scientific questions with those spiritual problems,
that at times they almost touched on the latter; but every time they were close
upon what seemed to him the chief point, they promptly beat a hasty retreat,
and plunged again into a sea of subtle distinctions, reservations, quotations,
allusions, and appeals to authorities, and it was with difficulty that he
understood what they were talking about.
“I cannot admit it,” said Sergey Ivanovitch, with his habitual
clearness, precision of expression, and elegance of phrase. “I cannot in
any case agree with Keiss that my whole conception of the external world has
been derived from perceptions. The most fundamental idea, the idea of
existence, has not been received by me through sensation; indeed, there is no
special sense-organ for the transmission of such an idea.”
“Yes, but they—Wurt, and Knaust, and Pripasov—would answer
that your consciousness of existence is derived from the conjunction of all
your sensations, that that consciousness of existence is the result of your
sensations. Wurt, indeed, says plainly that, assuming there are no sensations,
it follows that there is no idea of existence.”
“I maintain the contrary,” began Sergey Ivanovitch.
But here it seemed to Levin that just as they were close upon the real point of
the matter, they were again retreating, and he made up his mind to put a
question to the professor.
“According to that, if my senses are annihilated, if my body is dead, I
can have no existence of any sort?” he queried.
The professor, in annoyance, and, as it were, mental suffering at the
interruption, looked round at the strange inquirer, more like a bargeman than a
philosopher, and turned his eyes upon Sergey Ivanovitch, as though to ask:
What’s one to say to him? But Sergey Ivanovitch, who had been talking
with far less heat and one-sidedness than the professor, and who had sufficient
breadth of mind to answer the professor, and at the same time to comprehend the
simple and natural point of view from which the question was put, smiled and
said:
“That question we have no right to answer as yet.”
“We have not the requisite data,” chimed in the professor, and he
went back to his argument. “No,” he said; “I would point out
the fact that if, as Pripasov directly asserts, perception is based on
sensation, then we are bound to distinguish sharply between these two
conceptions.”
Levin listened no more, and simply waited for the professor to go.
When the professor had gone, Sergey Ivanovitch turned to his brother.
“Delighted that you’ve come. For some time, is it? How’s your
farming getting on?”
Levin knew that his elder brother took little interest in farming, and only put
the question in deference to him, and so he only told him about the sale of his
wheat and money matters.
Levin had meant to tell his brother of his determination to get married, and to
ask his advice; he had indeed firmly resolved to do so. But after seeing his
brother, listening to his conversation with the professor, hearing afterwards
the unconsciously patronizing tone in which his brother questioned him about
agricultural matters (their mother’s property had not been divided, and
Levin took charge of both their shares), Levin felt that he could not for some
reason begin to talk to him of his intention of marrying. He felt that his
brother would not look at it as he would have wished him to.
“Well, how is your district council doing?” asked Sergey
Ivanovitch, who was greatly interested in these local boards and attached great
importance to them.
“I really don’t know.”
“What! Why, surely you’re a member of the board?”
“No, I’m not a member now; I’ve resigned,” answered
Levin, “and I no longer attend the meetings.”
“What a pity!” commented Sergey Ivanovitch, frowning.
Levin in self-defense began to describe what took place in the meetings in his
district.
“That’s how it always is!” Sergey Ivanovitch interrupted him.
“We Russians are always like that. Perhaps it’s our strong point,
really, the faculty of seeing our own shortcomings; but we overdo it, we
comfort ourselves with irony which we always have on the tip of our tongues.
All I say is, give such rights as our local self-government to any other
European people—why, the Germans or the English would have worked their
way to freedom from them, while we simply turn them into ridicule.”
“But how can it be helped?” said Levin penitently. “It was my
last effort. And I did try with all my soul. I can’t. I’m no good
at it.”
“It’s not that you’re no good at it,” said Sergey
Ivanovitch; “it is that you don’t look at it as you should.”
“Perhaps not,” Levin answered dejectedly.
“Oh! do you know brother Nikolay’s turned up again?”
This brother Nikolay was the elder brother of Konstantin Levin, and
half-brother of Sergey Ivanovitch; a man utterly ruined, who had dissipated the
greater part of his fortune, was living in the strangest and lowest company,
and had quarreled with his brothers.
“What did you say?” Levin cried with horror. “How do you
know?”
“Prokofy saw him in the street.”
“Here in Moscow? Where is he? Do you know?” Levin got up from his
chair, as though on the point of starting off at once.
“I am sorry I told you,” said Sergey Ivanovitch, shaking his head
at his younger brother’s excitement. “I sent to find out where he
is living, and sent him his IOU to Trubin, which I paid. This is the answer he
sent me.”
And Sergey Ivanovitch took a note from under a paper-weight and handed it to
his brother.
Levin read in the queer, familiar handwriting: “I humbly beg you to leave
me in peace. That’s the only favor I ask of my gracious
brothers.—Nikolay Levin.”
Levin read it, and without raising his head stood with the note in his hands
opposite Sergey Ivanovitch.
There was a struggle in his heart between the desire to forget his unhappy
brother for the time, and the consciousness that it would be base to do so.
“He obviously wants to offend me,” pursued Sergey Ivanovitch;
“but he cannot offend me, and I should have wished with all my heart to
assist him, but I know it’s impossible to do that.”
“Yes, yes,” repeated Levin. “I understand and appreciate your
attitude to him; but I shall go and see him.”
“If you want to, do; but I shouldn’t advise it,” said Sergey
Ivanovitch. “As regards myself, I have no fear of your doing so; he will
not make you quarrel with me; but for your own sake, I should say you would do
better not to go. You can’t do him any good; still, do as you
please.”
“Very likely I can’t do any good, but I feel—especially at
such a moment—but that’s another thing—I feel I could not be
at peace.”
“Well, that I don’t understand,” said Sergey Ivanovitch.
“One thing I do understand,” he added; “it’s a lesson
in humility. I have come to look very differently and more charitably on what
is called infamous since brother Nikolay has become what he is ... you know
what he did....”
“Oh, it’s awful, awful!” repeated Levin.
After obtaining his brother’s address from Sergey Ivanovitch’s
footman, Levin was on the point of setting off at once to see him, but on
second thought he decided to put off his visit till the evening. The first
thing to do to set his heart at rest was to accomplish what he had come to
Moscow for. From his brother’s Levin went to Oblonsky’s office, and
on getting news of the Shtcherbatskys from him, he drove to the place where he
had been told he might find Kitty.
At four o’clock, conscious of his throbbing heart, Levin stepped out of a
hired sledge at the Zoological Gardens, and turned along the path to the frozen
mounds and the skating ground, knowing that he would certainly find her there,
as he had seen the Shtcherbatskys’ carriage at the entrance.
It was a bright, frosty day. Rows of carriages, sledges, drivers, and policemen
were standing in the approach. Crowds of well-dressed people, with hats bright
in the sun, swarmed about the entrance and along the well-swept little paths
between the little houses adorned with carving in the Russian style. The old
curly birches of the gardens, all their twigs laden with snow, looked as though
freshly decked in sacred vestments.
He walked along the path towards the skating-ground, and kept saying to
himself—“You mustn’t be excited, you must be calm.
What’s the matter with you? What do you want? Be quiet, stupid,” he
conjured his heart. And the more he tried to compose himself, the more
breathless he found himself. An acquaintance met him and called him by his
name, but Levin did not even recognize him. He went towards the mounds, whence
came the clank of the chains of sledges as they slipped down or were dragged
up, the rumble of the sliding sledges, and the sounds of merry voices. He
walked on a few steps, and the skating-ground lay open before his eyes, and at
once, amidst all the skaters, he knew her.
He knew she was there by the rapture and the terror that seized on his heart.
She was standing talking to a lady at the opposite end of the ground. There was
apparently nothing striking either in her dress or her attitude. But for Levin
she was as easy to find in that crowd as a rose among nettles. Everything was
made bright by her. She was the smile that shed light on all round her.
“Is it possible I can go over there on the ice, go up to her?” he
thought. The place where she stood seemed to him a holy shrine, unapproachable,
and there was one moment when he was almost retreating, so overwhelmed was he
with terror. He had to make an effort to master himself, and to remind himself
that people of all sorts were moving about her, and that he too might come
there to skate. He walked down, for a long while avoiding looking at her as at
the sun, but seeing her, as one does the sun, without looking.
On that day of the week and at that time of day people of one set, all
acquainted with one another, used to meet on the ice. There were crack skaters
there, showing off their skill, and learners clinging to chairs with timid,
awkward movements, boys, and elderly people skating with hygienic motives. They
seemed to Levin an elect band of blissful beings because they were here, near
her. All the skaters, it seemed, with perfect self-possession, skated towards
her, skated by her, even spoke to her, and were happy, quite apart from her,
enjoying the capital ice and the fine weather.
Nikolay Shtcherbatsky, Kitty’s cousin, in a short jacket and tight
trousers, was sitting on a garden seat with his skates on. Seeing Levin, he
shouted to him:
“Ah, the first skater in Russia! Been here long? First-rate ice—do
put your skates on.”
“I haven’t got my skates,” Levin answered, marveling at this
boldness and ease in her presence, and not for one second losing sight of her,
though he did not look at her. He felt as though the sun were coming near him.
She was in a corner, and turning out her slender feet in their high boots with
obvious timidity, she skated towards him. A boy in Russian dress, desperately
waving his arms and bowed down to the ground, overtook her. She skated a little
uncertainly; taking her hands out of the little muff that hung on a cord, she
held them ready for emergency, and looking towards Levin, whom she had
recognized, she smiled at him, and at her own fears. When she had got round the
turn, she gave herself a push off with one foot, and skated straight up to
Shtcherbatsky. Clutching at his arm, she nodded smiling to Levin. She was more
splendid than he had imagined her.
When he thought of her, he could call up a vivid picture of her to himself,
especially the charm of that little fair head, so freely set on the shapely
girlish shoulders, and so full of childish brightness and good humor. The
childishness of her expression, together with the delicate beauty of her
figure, made up her special charm, and that he fully realized. But what always
struck him in her as something unlooked for, was the expression of her eyes,
soft, serene, and truthful, and above all, her smile, which always transported
Levin to an enchanted world, where he felt himself softened and tender, as he
remembered himself in some days of his early childhood.
“Have you been here long?” she said, giving him her hand.
“Thank you,” she added, as he picked up the handkerchief that had
fallen out of her muff.
“I? I’ve not long ... yesterday ... I mean today ... I
arrived,” answered Levin, in his emotion not at once understanding her
question. “I was meaning to come and see you,” he said; and then,
recollecting with what intention he was trying to see her, he was promptly
overcome with confusion and blushed.
“I didn’t know you could skate, and skate so well.”
She looked at him earnestly, as though wishing to make out the cause of his
confusion.
“Your praise is worth having. The tradition is kept up here that you are
the best of skaters,” she said, with her little black-gloved hand
brushing a grain of hoarfrost off her muff.
“Yes, I used once to skate with passion; I wanted to reach
perfection.”
“You do everything with passion, I think,” she said smiling.
“I should so like to see how you skate. Put on skates, and let us skate
together.”
“Skate together! Can that be possible?” thought Levin, gazing at
her.
“I’ll put them on directly,” he said.
And he went off to get skates.
“It’s a long while since we’ve seen you here, sir,”
said the attendant, supporting his foot, and screwing on the heel of the skate.
“Except you, there’s none of the gentlemen first-rate skaters. Will
that be all right?” said he, tightening the strap.
“Oh, yes, yes; make haste, please,” answered Levin, with difficulty
restraining the smile of rapture which would overspread his face.
“Yes,” he thought, “this now is life, this is happiness!
Together, she said; let us skate together! Speak to her now? But
that’s just why I’m afraid to speak—because I’m happy
now, happy in hope, anyway.... And then?... But I must! I must! I must! Away
with weakness!”
Levin rose to his feet, took off his overcoat, and scurrying over the rough ice
round the hut, came out on the smooth ice and skated without effort, as it
were, by simple exercise of will, increasing and slackening speed and turning
his course. He approached with timidity, but again her smile reassured him.
She gave him her hand, and they set off side by side, going faster and faster,
and the more rapidly they moved the more tightly she grasped his hand.
“With you I should soon learn; I somehow feel confidence in you,”
she said to him.
“And I have confidence in myself when you are leaning on me,” he
said, but was at once panic-stricken at what he had said, and blushed. And
indeed, no sooner had he uttered these words, when all at once, like the sun
going behind a cloud, her face lost all its friendliness, and Levin detected
the familiar change in her expression that denoted the working of thought; a
crease showed on her smooth brow.
“Is there anything troubling you?—though I’ve no right to ask
such a question,” he added hurriedly.
“Oh, why so?... No, I have nothing to trouble me,” she responded
coldly; and she added immediately: “You haven’t seen Mlle. Linon,
have you?”
“Not yet.”
“Go and speak to her, she likes you so much.”
“What’s wrong? I have offended her. Lord help me!” thought
Levin, and he flew towards the old Frenchwoman with the gray ringlets, who was
sitting on a bench. Smiling and showing her false teeth, she greeted him as an
old friend.
“Yes, you see we’re growing up,” she said to him, glancing
towards Kitty, “and growing old. Tiny bear has grown big
now!” pursued the Frenchwoman, laughing, and she reminded him of his joke
about the three young ladies whom he had compared to the three bears in the
English nursery tale. “Do you remember that’s what you used to call
them?”
He remembered absolutely nothing, but she had been laughing at the joke for ten
years now, and was fond of it.
“Now, go and skate, go and skate. Our Kitty has learned to skate nicely,
hasn’t she?”
When Levin darted up to Kitty her face was no longer stern; her eyes looked at
him with the same sincerity and friendliness, but Levin fancied that in her
friendliness there was a certain note of deliberate composure. And he felt
depressed. After talking a little of her old governess and her peculiarities,
she questioned him about his life.
“Surely you must be dull in the country in the winter, aren’t
you?” she said.
“No, I’m not dull, I am very busy,” he said, feeling that she
was holding him in check by her composed tone, which he would not have the
force to break through, just as it had been at the beginning of the winter.
“Are you going to stay in town long?” Kitty questioned him.
“I don’t know,” he answered, not thinking of what he was
saying. The thought that if he were held in check by her tone of quiet
friendliness he would end by going back again without deciding anything came
into his mind, and he resolved to make a struggle against it.
“How is it you don’t know?”
“I don’t know. It depends upon you,” he said, and was
immediately horror-stricken at his own words.
Whether it was that she had heard his words, or that she did not want to hear
them, she made a sort of stumble, twice struck out, and hurriedly skated away
from him. She skated up to Mlle. Linon, said something to her, and went towards
the pavilion where the ladies took off their skates.
“My God! what have I done! Merciful God! help me, guide me,” said
Levin, praying inwardly, and at the same time, feeling a need of violent
exercise, he skated about describing inner and outer circles.
At that moment one of the young men, the best of the skaters of the day, came
out of the coffee-house in his skates, with a cigarette in his mouth. Taking a
run, he dashed down the steps in his skates, crashing and bounding up and down.
He flew down, and without even changing the position of his hands, skated away
over the ice.
“Ah, that’s a new trick!” said Levin, and he promptly ran up
to the top to do this new trick.
“Don’t break your neck! it needs practice!” Nikolay
Shtcherbatsky shouted after him.
Levin went to the steps, took a run from above as best he could, and dashed
down, preserving his balance in this unwonted movement with his hands. On the
last step he stumbled, but barely touching the ice with his hand, with a
violent effort recovered himself, and skated off, laughing.
“How splendid, how nice he is!” Kitty was thinking at that time, as
she came out of the pavilion with Mlle. Linon, and looked towards him with a
smile of quiet affection, as though he were a favorite brother. “And can
it be my fault, can I have done anything wrong? They talk of flirtation. I know
it’s not he that I love; but still I am happy with him, and he’s so
jolly. Only, why did he say that?...” she mused.
Catching sight of Kitty going away, and her mother meeting her at the steps,
Levin, flushed from his rapid exercise, stood still and pondered a minute. He
took off his skates, and overtook the mother and daughter at the entrance of
the gardens.
“Delighted to see you,” said Princess Shtcherbatskaya. “On
Thursdays we are home, as always.”
“Today, then?”
“We shall be pleased to see you,” the princess said stiffly.
This stiffness hurt Kitty, and she could not resist the desire to smooth over
her mother’s coldness. She turned her head, and with a smile said:
“Good-bye till this evening.”
At that moment Stepan Arkadyevitch, his hat cocked on one side, with beaming
face and eyes, strode into the garden like a conquering hero. But as he
approached his mother-in-law, he responded in a mournful and crestfallen tone
to her inquiries about Dolly’s health. After a little subdued and
dejected conversation with his mother-in-law, he threw out his chest again, and
put his arm in Levin’s.
“Well, shall we set off?” he asked. “I’ve been thinking
about you all this time, and I’m very, very glad you’ve
come,” he said, looking him in the face with a significant air.
“Yes, come along,” answered Levin in ecstasy, hearing unceasingly
the sound of that voice saying, “Good-bye till this evening,” and
seeing the smile with which it was said.
“To the England or the Hermitage?”
“I don’t mind which.”
“All right, then, the England,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, selecting
that restaurant because he owed more there than at the Hermitage, and
consequently considered it mean to avoid it. “Have you got a sledge?
That’s first-rate, for I sent my carriage home.”
The friends hardly spoke all the way. Levin was wondering what that change in
Kitty’s expression had meant, and alternately assuring himself that there
was hope, and falling into despair, seeing clearly that his hopes were insane,
and yet all the while he felt himself quite another man, utterly unlike what he
had been before her smile and those words, “Good-bye till this
evening.”
Stepan Arkadyevitch was absorbed during the drive in composing the menu of the
dinner.
“You like turbot, don’t you?” he said to Levin as they were
arriving.
“Eh?” responded Levin. “Turbot? Yes, I’m awfully
fond of turbot.”
When Levin went into the restaurant with Oblonsky, he could not help noticing a
certain peculiarity of expression, as it were, a restrained radiance, about the
face and whole figure of Stepan Arkadyevitch. Oblonsky took off his overcoat,
and with his hat over one ear walked into the dining-room, giving directions to
the Tatar waiters, who were clustered about him in evening coats, bearing
napkins. Bowing to right and left to the people he met, and here as everywhere
joyously greeting acquaintances, he went up to the sideboard for a preliminary
appetizer of fish and vodka, and said to the painted Frenchwoman decked in
ribbons, lace, and ringlets, behind the counter, something so amusing that even
that Frenchwoman was moved to genuine laughter. Levin for his part refrained
from taking any vodka simply because he felt such a loathing of that
Frenchwoman, all made up, it seemed, of false hair, poudre de riz, and
vinaigre de toilette. He made haste to move away from her, as from a
dirty place. His whole soul was filled with memories of Kitty, and there was a
smile of triumph and happiness shining in his eyes.
“This way, your excellency, please. Your excellency won’t be
disturbed here,” said a particularly pertinacious, white-headed old Tatar
with immense hips and coat-tails gaping widely behind. “Walk in, your
excellency,” he said to Levin; by way of showing his respect to Stepan
Arkadyevitch, being attentive to his guest as well.
Instantly flinging a fresh cloth over the round table under the bronze
chandelier, though it already had a table cloth on it, he pushed up velvet
chairs, and came to a standstill before Stepan Arkadyevitch with a napkin and a
bill of fare in his hands, awaiting his commands.
“If you prefer it, your excellency, a private room will be free directly;
Prince Golistin with a lady. Fresh oysters have come in.”
“Ah! oysters.”
Stepan Arkadyevitch became thoughtful.
“How if we were to change our program, Levin?” he said, keeping his
finger on the bill of fare. And his face expressed serious hesitation.
“Are the oysters good? Mind now.”
“They’re Flensburg, your excellency. We’ve no Ostend.”
“Flensburg will do, but are they fresh?”
“Only arrived yesterday.”
“Well, then, how if we were to begin with oysters, and so change the
whole program? Eh?”
“It’s all the same to me. I should like cabbage soup and porridge
better than anything; but of course there’s nothing like that
here.”
“Porridge à la Russe, your honor would like?” said the
Tatar, bending down to Levin, like a nurse speaking to a child.
“No, joking apart, whatever you choose is sure to be good. I’ve
been skating, and I’m hungry. And don’t imagine,” he added,
detecting a look of dissatisfaction on Oblonsky’s face, “that I
shan’t appreciate your choice. I am fond of good things.”
“I should hope so! After all, it’s one of the pleasures of
life,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch. “Well, then, my friend, you give
us two—or better say three—dozen oysters, clear soup with
vegetables....”
“Printanière,” prompted the Tatar. But Stepan Arkadyevitch
apparently did not care to allow him the satisfaction of giving the French
names of the dishes.
“With vegetables in it, you know. Then turbot with thick sauce, then ...
roast beef; and mind it’s good. Yes, and capons, perhaps, and then
sweets.”
The Tatar, recollecting that it was Stepan Arkadyevitch’s way not to call
the dishes by the names in the French bill of fare, did not repeat them after
him, but could not resist rehearsing the whole menu to himself according to the
bill:—“Soupe printanière, turbot, sauce Beaumarchais, poulard à
l’estragon, macédoine de fruits ... etc.,” and then instantly,
as though worked by springs, laying down one bound bill of fare, he took up
another, the list of wines, and submitted it to Stepan Arkadyevitch.
“What shall we drink?”
“What you like, only not too much. Champagne,” said Levin.
“What! to start with? You’re right though, I dare say. Do you like
the white seal?”
“Cachet blanc,” prompted the Tatar.
“Very well, then, give us that brand with the oysters, and then
we’ll see.”
“Yes, sir. And what table wine?”
“You can give us Nuits. Oh, no, better the classic Chablis.”
“Yes, sir. And your cheese, your excellency?”
“Oh, yes, Parmesan. Or would you like another?”
“No, it’s all the same to me,” said Levin, unable to suppress
a smile.
And the Tatar ran off with flying coat-tails, and in five minutes darted in
with a dish of opened oysters on mother-of-pearl shells, and a bottle between
his fingers.
Stepan Arkadyevitch crushed the starchy napkin, tucked it into his waistcoat,
and settling his arms comfortably, started on the oysters.
“Not bad,” he said, stripping the oysters from the pearly shell
with a silver fork, and swallowing them one after another. “Not
bad,” he repeated, turning his dewy, brilliant eyes from Levin to the
Tatar.
Levin ate the oysters indeed, though white bread and cheese would have pleased
him better. But he was admiring Oblonsky. Even the Tatar, uncorking the bottle
and pouring the sparkling wine into the delicate glasses, glanced at Stepan
Arkadyevitch, and settled his white cravat with a perceptible smile of
satisfaction.
“You don’t care much for oysters, do you?” said Stepan
Arkadyevitch, emptying his wine-glass, “or you’re worried about
something. Eh?”
He wanted Levin to be in good spirits. But it was not that Levin was not in
good spirits; he was ill at ease. With what he had in his soul, he felt sore
and uncomfortable in the restaurant, in the midst of private rooms where men
were dining with ladies, in all this fuss and bustle; the surroundings of
bronzes, looking-glasses, gas, and waiters—all of it was offensive to
him. He was afraid of sullying what his soul was brimful of.
“I? Yes, I am; but besides, all this bothers me,” he said.
“You can’t conceive how queer it all seems to a country person like
me, as queer as that gentleman’s nails I saw at your place....”
“Yes, I saw how much interested you were in poor Grinevitch’s
nails,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, laughing.
“It’s too much for me,” responded Levin. “Do try, now,
and put yourself in my place, take the point of view of a country person. We in
the country try to bring our hands into such a state as will be most convenient
for working with. So we cut our nails; sometimes we turn up our sleeves. And
here people purposely let their nails grow as long as they will, and link on
small saucers by way of studs, so that they can do nothing with their
hands.”
Stepan Arkadyevitch smiled gaily.
“Oh, yes, that’s just a sign that he has no need to do coarse work.
His work is with the mind....”
“Maybe. But still it’s queer to me, just as at this moment it seems
queer to me that we country folks try to get our meals over as soon as we can,
so as to be ready for our work, while here are we trying to drag out our meal
as long as possible, and with that object eating oysters....”
“Why, of course,” objected Stepan Arkadyevitch. “But
that’s just the aim of civilization—to make everything a source of
enjoyment.”
“Well, if that’s its aim, I’d rather be a savage.”
“And so you are a savage. All you Levins are savages.”
Levin sighed. He remembered his brother Nikolay, and felt ashamed and sore, and
he scowled; but Oblonsky began speaking of a subject which at once drew his
attention.
“Oh, I say, are you going tonight to our people, the
Shtcherbatskys’, I mean?” he said, his eyes sparkling significantly
as he pushed away the empty rough shells, and drew the cheese towards him.
“Yes, I shall certainly go,” replied Levin; “though I fancied
the princess was not very warm in her invitation.”
“What nonsense! That’s her manner.... Come, boy, the soup!...
That’s her manner—grande dame,” said Stepan
Arkadyevitch. “I’m coming, too, but I have to go to the Countess
Bonina’s rehearsal. Come, isn’t it true that you’re a savage?
How do you explain the sudden way in which you vanished from Moscow? The
Shtcherbatskys were continually asking me about you, as though I ought to know.
The only thing I know is that you always do what no one else does.”
“Yes,” said Levin, slowly and with emotion, “you’re
right. I am a savage. Only, my savageness is not in having gone away, but in
coming now. Now I have come....”
“Oh, what a lucky fellow you are!” broke in Stepan Arkadyevitch,
looking into Levin’s eyes.
“Why?”
“‘I know a gallant steed by tokens sure,
And by his eyes I know a youth in love,’”
declaimed Stepan Arkadyevitch. “Everything is before you.”
“Why, is it over for you already?”
“No; not over exactly, but the future is yours, and the present is mine,
and the present—well, it’s not all that it might be.”
“How so?”
“Oh, things go wrong. But I don’t want to talk of myself, and
besides I can’t explain it all,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch.
“Well, why have you come to Moscow, then?... Hi! take away!” he
called to the Tatar.
“You guess?” responded Levin, his eyes like deep wells of light
fixed on Stepan Arkadyevitch.
“I guess, but I can’t be the first to talk about it. You can see by
that whether I guess right or wrong,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, gazing at
Levin with a subtle smile.
“Well, and what have you to say to me?” said Levin in a quivering
voice, feeling that all the muscles of his face were quivering too. “How
do you look at the question?”
Stepan Arkadyevitch slowly emptied his glass of Chablis, never taking his eyes
off Levin.
“I?” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, “there’s nothing I
desire so much as that—nothing! It would be the best thing that could
be.”
“But you’re not making a mistake? You know what we’re
speaking of?” said Levin, piercing him with his eyes. “You think
it’s possible?”
“I think it’s possible. Why not possible?”
“No! do you really think it’s possible? No, tell me all you think!
Oh, but if ... if refusal’s in store for me!... Indeed I feel
sure....”
“Why should you think that?” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, smiling at
his excitement.
“It seems so to me sometimes. That will be awful for me, and for her
too.”
“Oh, well, anyway there’s nothing awful in it for a girl. Every
girl’s proud of an offer.”
“Yes, every girl, but not she.”
Stepan Arkadyevitch smiled. He so well knew that feeling of Levin’s, that
for him all the girls in the world were divided into two classes: one
class—all the girls in the world except her, and those girls with all
sorts of human weaknesses, and very ordinary girls: the other class—she
alone, having no weaknesses of any sort and higher than all humanity.
“Stay, take some sauce,” he said, holding back Levin’s hand
as it pushed away the sauce.
Levin obediently helped himself to sauce, but would not let Stepan Arkadyevitch
go on with his dinner.
“No, stop a minute, stop a minute,” he said. “You must
understand that it’s a question of life and death for me. I have never
spoken to anyone of this. And there’s no one I could speak of it to,
except you. You know we’re utterly unlike each other, different tastes
and views and everything; but I know you’re fond of me and understand me,
and that’s why I like you awfully. But for God’s sake, be quite
straightforward with me.”
“I tell you what I think,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, smiling.
“But I’ll say more: my wife is a wonderful woman....” Stepan
Arkadyevitch sighed, remembering his position with his wife, and, after a
moment’s silence, resumed—“She has a gift of foreseeing
things. She sees right through people; but that’s not all; she knows what
will come to pass, especially in the way of marriages. She foretold, for
instance, that Princess Shahovskaya would marry Brenteln. No one would believe
it, but it came to pass. And she’s on your side.”
“How do you mean?”
“It’s not only that she likes you—she says that Kitty is
certain to be your wife.”
At these words Levin’s face suddenly lighted up with a smile, a smile not
far from tears of emotion.
“She says that!” cried Levin. “I always said she was
exquisite, your wife. There, that’s enough, enough said about it,”
he said, getting up from his seat.
“All right, but do sit down.”
But Levin could not sit down. He walked with his firm tread twice up and down
the little cage of a room, blinked his eyelids that his tears might not fall,
and only then sat down to the table.
“You must understand,” said he, “it’s not love.
I’ve been in love, but it’s not that. It’s not my feeling,
but a sort of force outside me has taken possession of me. I went away, you
see, because I made up my mind that it could never be, you understand, as a
happiness that does not come on earth; but I’ve struggled with myself, I
see there’s no living without it. And it must be settled.”
“What did you go away for?”
“Ah, stop a minute! Ah, the thoughts that come crowding on one! The
questions one must ask oneself! Listen. You can’t imagine what
you’ve done for me by what you said. I’m so happy that I’ve
become positively hateful; I’ve forgotten everything. I heard today that
my brother Nikolay ... you know, he’s here ... I had even forgotten him.
It seems to me that he’s happy too. It’s a sort of madness. But one
thing’s awful.... Here, you’ve been married, you know the feeling
... it’s awful that we—old—with a past ... not of love, but
of sins ... are brought all at once so near to a creature pure and innocent;
it’s loathsome, and that’s why one can’t help feeling oneself
unworthy.”
“Oh, well, you’ve not many sins on your conscience.”
“Alas! all the same,” said Levin, “when with loathing I go
over my life, I shudder and curse and bitterly regret it.... Yes.”
“What would you have? The world’s made so,” said Stepan
Arkadyevitch.
“The one comfort is like that prayer, which I always liked:
‘Forgive me not according to my unworthiness, but according to Thy
loving-kindness.’ That’s the only way she can forgive me.”
Levin emptied his glass, and they were silent for a while.
“There’s one other thing I ought to tell you. Do you know
Vronsky?” Stepan Arkadyevitch asked Levin.
“No, I don’t. Why do you ask?”
“Give us another bottle,” Stepan Arkadyevitch directed the Tatar,
who was filling up their glasses and fidgeting round them just when he was not
wanted.
“Why you ought to know Vronsky is that he’s one of your
rivals.”
“Who’s Vronsky?” said Levin, and his face was suddenly
transformed from the look of childlike ecstasy which Oblonsky had just been
admiring to an angry and unpleasant expression.
“Vronsky is one of the sons of Count Kirill Ivanovitch Vronsky, and one
of the finest specimens of the gilded youth of Petersburg. I made his
acquaintance in Tver when I was there on official business, and he came there
for the levy of recruits. Fearfully rich, handsome, great connections, an
aide-de-camp, and with all that a very nice, good-natured fellow. But
he’s more than simply a good-natured fellow, as I’ve found out
here—he’s a cultivated man, too, and very intelligent; he’s a
man who’ll make his mark.”
Levin scowled and was dumb.
“Well, he turned up here soon after you’d gone, and as I can see,
he’s over head and ears in love with Kitty, and you know that her
mother....”
“Excuse me, but I know nothing,” said Levin, frowning gloomily. And
immediately he recollected his brother Nikolay and how hateful he was to have
been able to forget him.
“You wait a bit, wait a bit,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, smiling and
touching his hand. “I’ve told you what I know, and I repeat that in
this delicate and tender matter, as far as one can conjecture, I believe the
chances are in your favor.”
Levin dropped back in his chair; his face was pale.
“But I would advise you to settle the thing as soon as may be,”
pursued Oblonsky, filling up his glass.
“No, thanks, I can’t drink any more,” said Levin, pushing
away his glass. “I shall be drunk.... Come, tell me how are you getting
on?” he went on, obviously anxious to change the conversation.
“One word more: in any case I advise you to settle the question soon.
Tonight I don’t advise you to speak,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch.
“Go round tomorrow morning, make an offer in due form, and God bless
you....”
“Oh, do you still think of coming to me for some shooting? Come next
spring, do,” said Levin.
Now his whole soul was full of remorse that he had begun this conversation with
Stepan Arkadyevitch. A feeling such as his was profaned by talk of the rivalry
of some Petersburg officer, of the suppositions and the counsels of Stepan
Arkadyevitch.
Stepan Arkadyevitch smiled. He knew what was passing in Levin’s soul.
“I’ll come some day,” he said. “But women, my boy,
they’re the pivot everything turns upon. Things are in a bad way with me,
very bad. And it’s all through women. Tell me frankly now,” he
pursued, picking up a cigar and keeping one hand on his glass; “give me
your advice.”
“Why, what is it?”
“I’ll tell you. Suppose you’re married, you love your wife,
but you’re fascinated by another woman....”
“Excuse me, but I’m absolutely unable to comprehend how ... just as
I can’t comprehend how I could now, after my dinner, go straight to a
baker’s shop and steal a roll.”
Stepan Arkadyevitch’s eyes sparkled more than usual.
“Why not? A roll will sometimes smell so good one can’t resist
it.”
“Himmlisch ist’s, wenn ich bezwungen
    Meine irdische Begier;
Aber doch wenn’s nich gelungen
    Hatt’ ich auch recht hübsch Plaisir!”
As he said this, Stepan Arkadyevitch smiled subtly. Levin, too, could not help
smiling.
“Yes, but joking apart,” resumed Stepan Arkadyevitch, “you
must understand that the woman is a sweet, gentle loving creature, poor and
lonely, and has sacrificed everything. Now, when the thing’s done,
don’t you see, can one possibly cast her off? Even supposing one parts
from her, so as not to break up one’s family life, still, can one help
feeling for her, setting her on her feet, softening her lot?”
“Well, you must excuse me there. You know to me all women are divided
into two classes ... at least no ... truer to say: there are women and there
are ... I’ve never seen exquisite fallen beings, and I never shall see
them, but such creatures as that painted Frenchwoman at the counter with the
ringlets are vermin to my mind, and all fallen women are the same.”
“But the Magdalen?”
“Ah, drop that! Christ would never have said those words if He had known
how they would be abused. Of all the Gospel those words are the only ones
remembered. However, I’m not saying so much what I think, as what I feel.
I have a loathing for fallen women. You’re afraid of spiders, and I of
these vermin. Most likely you’ve not made a study of spiders and
don’t know their character; and so it is with me.”
“It’s very well for you to talk like that; it’s very much
like that gentleman in Dickens who used to fling all difficult questions over
his right shoulder. But to deny the facts is no answer. What’s to be
done—you tell me that, what’s to be done? Your wife gets older,
while you’re full of life. Before you’ve time to look round, you
feel that you can’t love your wife with love, however much you may esteem
her. And then all at once love turns up, and you’re done for, done
for,” Stepan Arkadyevitch said with weary despair.
Levin half smiled.
“Yes, you’re done for,” resumed Oblonsky. “But
what’s to be done?”
“Don’t steal rolls.”
Stepan Arkadyevitch laughed outright.
“Oh, moralist! But you must understand, there are two women; one insists
only on her rights, and those rights are your love, which you can’t give
her; and the other sacrifices everything for you and asks for nothing. What are
you to do? How are you to act? There’s a fearful tragedy in it.”
“If you care for my profession of faith as regards that, I’ll tell
you that I don’t believe there was any tragedy about it. And this is why.
To my mind, love ... both the sorts of love, which you remember Plato defines
in his Banquet, served as the test of men. Some men only understand one sort,
and some only the other. And those who only know the non-platonic love have no
need to talk of tragedy. In such love there can be no sort of tragedy.
‘I’m much obliged for the gratification, my humble
respects’—that’s all the tragedy. And in platonic love there
can be no tragedy, because in that love all is clear and pure,
because....”
At that instant Levin recollected his own sins and the inner conflict he had
lived through. And he added unexpectedly:
“But perhaps you are right. Very likely ... I don’t know, I
don’t know.”
“It’s this, don’t you see,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch,
“you’re very much all of a piece. That’s your strong point
and your failing. You have a character that’s all of a piece, and you
want the whole of life to be of a piece too—but that’s not how it
is. You despise public official work because you want the reality to be
invariably corresponding all the while with the aim—and that’s not
how it is. You want a man’s work, too, always to have a defined aim, and
love and family life always to be undivided—and that’s not how it
is. All the variety, all the charm, all the beauty of life is made up of light
and shadow.”
Levin sighed and made no reply. He was thinking of his own affairs, and did not
hear Oblonsky.
And suddenly both of them felt that though they were friends, though they had
been dining and drinking together, which should have drawn them closer, yet
each was thinking only of his own affairs, and they had nothing to do with one
another. Oblonsky had more than once experienced this extreme sense of
aloofness, instead of intimacy, coming on after dinner, and he knew what to do
in such cases.
“Bill!” he called, and he went into the next room where he promptly
came across an aide-de-camp of his acquaintance and dropped into conversation
with him about an actress and her protector. And at once in the conversation
with the aide-de-camp Oblonsky had a sense of relaxation and relief after the
conversation with Levin, which always put him to too great a mental and
spiritual strain.
When the Tatar appeared with a bill for twenty-six roubles and odd kopecks,
besides a tip for himself, Levin, who would another time have been horrified,
like anyone from the country, at his share of fourteen roubles, did not notice
it, paid, and set off homewards to dress and go to the Shtcherbatskys’
there to decide his fate.
The young Princess Kitty Shtcherbatskaya was eighteen. It was the first winter
that she had been out in the world. Her success in society had been greater
than that of either of her elder sisters, and greater even than her mother had
anticipated. To say nothing of the young men who danced at the Moscow balls
being almost all in love with Kitty, two serious suitors had already this first
winter made their appearance: Levin, and immediately after his departure, Count
Vronsky.
Levin’s appearance at the beginning of the winter, his frequent visits,
and evident love for Kitty, had led to the first serious conversations between
Kitty’s parents as to her future, and to disputes between them. The
prince was on Levin’s side; he said he wished for nothing better for
Kitty. The princess for her part, going round the question in the manner
peculiar to women, maintained that Kitty was too young, that Levin had done
nothing to prove that he had serious intentions, that Kitty felt no great
attraction to him, and other side issues; but she did not state the principal
point, which was that she looked for a better match for her daughter, and that
Levin was not to her liking, and she did not understand him. When Levin had
abruptly departed, the princess was delighted, and said to her husband
triumphantly: “You see I was right.” When Vronsky appeared on the
scene, she was still more delighted, confirmed in her opinion that Kitty was to
make not simply a good, but a brilliant match.
In the mother’s eyes there could be no comparison between Vronsky and
Levin. She disliked in Levin his strange and uncompromising opinions and his
shyness in society, founded, as she supposed, on his pride and his queer sort
of life, as she considered it, absorbed in cattle and peasants. She did not
very much like it that he, who was in love with her daughter, had kept coming
to the house for six weeks, as though he were waiting for something,
inspecting, as though he were afraid he might be doing them too great an honor
by making an offer, and did not realize that a man, who continually visits at a
house where there is a young unmarried girl, is bound to make his intentions
clear. And suddenly, without doing so, he disappeared. “It’s as
well he’s not attractive enough for Kitty to have fallen in love with
him,” thought the mother.
Vronsky satisfied all the mother’s desires. Very wealthy, clever, of
aristocratic family, on the highroad to a brilliant career in the army and at
court, and a fascinating man. Nothing better could be wished for.
Vronsky openly flirted with Kitty at balls, danced with her, and came
continually to the house, consequently there could be no doubt of the
seriousness of his intentions. But, in spite of that, the mother had spent the
whole of that winter in a state of terrible anxiety and agitation.
Princess Shtcherbatskaya had herself been married thirty years ago, her aunt
arranging the match. Her husband, about whom everything was well known
beforehand, had come, looked at his future bride, and been looked at. The
matchmaking aunt had ascertained and communicated their mutual impression.
That impression had been favorable. Afterwards, on a day fixed beforehand, the
expected offer was made to her parents, and accepted. All had passed very
simply and easily. So it seemed, at least, to the princess. But over her own
daughters she had felt how far from simple and easy is the business, apparently
so commonplace, of marrying off one’s daughters. The panics that had been
lived through, the thoughts that had been brooded over, the money that had been
wasted, and the disputes with her husband over marrying the two elder girls,
Darya and Natalia! Now, since the youngest had come out, she was going through
the same terrors, the same doubts, and still more violent quarrels with her
husband than she had over the elder girls. The old prince, like all fathers
indeed, was exceedingly punctilious on the score of the honor and reputation of
his daughters. He was irrationally jealous over his daughters, especially over
Kitty, who was his favorite. At every turn he had scenes with the princess for
compromising her daughter. The princess had grown accustomed to this already
with her other daughters, but now she felt that there was more ground for the
prince’s touchiness. She saw that of late years much was changed in the
manners of society, that a mother’s duties had become still more
difficult. She saw that girls of Kitty’s age formed some sort of clubs,
went to some sort of lectures, mixed freely in men’s society; drove about
the streets alone, many of them did not curtsey, and, what was the most
important thing, all the girls were firmly convinced that to choose their
husbands was their own affair, and not their parents’. “Marriages
aren’t made nowadays as they used to be,” was thought and said by
all these young girls, and even by their elders. But how marriages were made
now, the princess could not learn from anyone. The French fashion—of the
parents arranging their children’s future—was not accepted; it was
condemned. The English fashion of the complete independence of girls was also
not accepted, and not possible in Russian society. The Russian fashion of
matchmaking by the offices of intermediate persons was for some reason
considered unseemly; it was ridiculed by everyone, and by the princess herself.
But how girls were to be married, and how parents were to marry them, no one
knew. Everyone with whom the princess had chanced to discuss the matter said
the same thing: “Mercy on us, it’s high time in our day to cast off
all that old-fashioned business. It’s the young people have to marry; and
not their parents; and so we ought to leave the young people to arrange it as
they choose.” It was very easy for anyone to say that who had no
daughters, but the princess realized that in the process of getting to know
each other, her daughter might fall in love, and fall in love with someone who
did not care to marry her or who was quite unfit to be her husband. And,
however much it was instilled into the princess that in our times young people
ought to arrange their lives for themselves, she was unable to believe it, just
as she would have been unable to believe that, at any time whatever, the most
suitable playthings for children five years old ought to be loaded pistols. And
so the princess was more uneasy over Kitty than she had been over her elder
sisters.
Now she was afraid that Vronsky might confine himself to simply flirting with
her daughter. She saw that her daughter was in love with him, but tried to
comfort herself with the thought that he was an honorable man, and would not do
this. But at the same time she knew how easy it is, with the freedom of manners
of today, to turn a girl’s head, and how lightly men generally regard
such a crime. The week before, Kitty had told her mother of a conversation she
had with Vronsky during a mazurka. This conversation had partly reassured the
princess; but perfectly at ease she could not be. Vronsky had told Kitty that
both he and his brother were so used to obeying their mother that they never
made up their minds to any important undertaking without consulting her.
“And just now, I am impatiently awaiting my mother’s arrival from
Petersburg, as peculiarly fortunate,” he told her.
Kitty had repeated this without attaching any significance to the words. But
her mother saw them in a different light. She knew that the old lady was
expected from day to day, that she would be pleased at her son’s choice,
and she felt it strange that he should not make his offer through fear of
vexing his mother. However, she was so anxious for the marriage itself, and
still more for relief from her fears, that she believed it was so. Bitter as it
was for the princess to see the unhappiness of her eldest daughter, Dolly, on
the point of leaving her husband, her anxiety over the decision of her youngest
daughter’s fate engrossed all her feelings. Today, with Levin’s
reappearance, a fresh source of anxiety arose. She was afraid that her
daughter, who had at one time, as she fancied, a feeling for Levin, might, from
extreme sense of honor, refuse Vronsky, and that Levin’s arrival might
generally complicate and delay the affair so near being concluded.
“Why, has he been here long?” the princess asked about Levin, as
they returned home.
“He came today, mamma.”
“There’s one thing I want to say....” began the princess, and
from her serious and alert face, Kitty guessed what it would be.
“Mamma,” she said, flushing hotly and turning quickly to her,
“please, please don’t say anything about that. I know, I know all
about it.”
She wished for what her mother wished for, but the motives of her
mother’s wishes wounded her.
“I only want to say that to raise hopes....”
“Mamma, darling, for goodness’ sake, don’t talk about it.
It’s so horrible to talk about it.”
“I won’t,” said her mother, seeing the tears in her
daughter’s eyes; “but one thing, my love; you promised me you would
have no secrets from me. You won’t?”
“Never, mamma, none,” answered Kitty, flushing a little, and
looking her mother straight in the face, “but there’s no use in my
telling you anything, and I ... I ... if I wanted to, I don’t know what
to say or how.... I don’t know....”
“No, she could not tell an untruth with those eyes,” thought the
mother, smiling at her agitation and happiness. The princess smiled that what
was taking place just now in her soul seemed to the poor child so immense and
so important.
After dinner, and till the beginning of the evening, Kitty was feeling a
sensation akin to the sensation of a young man before a battle. Her heart
throbbed violently, and her thoughts would not rest on anything.
She felt that this evening, when they would both meet for the first time, would
be a turning point in her life. And she was continually picturing them to
herself, at one moment each separately, and then both together. When she mused
on the past, she dwelt with pleasure, with tenderness, on the memories of her
relations with Levin. The memories of childhood and of Levin’s friendship
with her dead brother gave a special poetic charm to her relations with him.
His love for her, of which she felt certain, was flattering and delightful to
her; and it was pleasant for her to think of Levin. In her memories of Vronsky
there always entered a certain element of awkwardness, though he was in the
highest degree well-bred and at ease, as though there were some false
note—not in Vronsky, he was very simple and nice, but in herself, while
with Levin she felt perfectly simple and clear. But, on the other hand,
directly she thought of the future with Vronsky, there arose before her a
perspective of brilliant happiness; with Levin the future seemed misty.
When she went upstairs to dress, and looked into the looking-glass, she noticed
with joy that it was one of her good days, and that she was in complete
possession of all her forces,—she needed this so for what lay before her:
she was conscious of external composure and free grace in her movements.
At half-past seven she had only just gone down into the drawing-room, when the
footman announced, “Konstantin Dmitrievitch Levin.” The princess
was still in her room, and the prince had not come in. “So it is to
be,” thought Kitty, and all the blood seemed to rush to her heart. She
was horrified at her paleness, as she glanced into the looking-glass. At that
moment she knew beyond doubt that he had come early on purpose to find her
alone and to make her an offer. And only then for the first time the whole
thing presented itself in a new, different aspect; only then she realized that
the question did not affect her only—with whom she would be happy, and
whom she loved—but that she would have that moment to wound a man whom
she liked. And to wound him cruelly. What for? Because he, dear fellow, loved
her, was in love with her. But there was no help for it, so it must be, so it
would have to be.
“My God! shall I myself really have to say it to him?” she thought.
“Can I tell him I don’t love him? That will be a lie. What am I to
say to him? That I love someone else? No, that’s impossible. I’m
going away, I’m going away.”
She had reached the door, when she heard his step. “No! it’s not
honest. What have I to be afraid of? I have done nothing wrong. What is to be,
will be! I’ll tell the truth. And with him one can’t be ill at
ease. Here he is,” she said to herself, seeing his powerful, shy figure,
with his shining eyes fixed on her. She looked straight into his face, as
though imploring him to spare her, and gave her hand.
“It’s not time yet; I think I’m too early,” he said
glancing round the empty drawing-room. When he saw that his expectations were
realized, that there was nothing to prevent him from speaking, his face became
gloomy.
“Oh, no,” said Kitty, and sat down at the table.
“But this was just what I wanted, to find you alone,” he began, not
sitting down, and not looking at her, so as not to lose courage.
“Mamma will be down directly. She was very much tired....
Yesterday....”
She talked on, not knowing what her lips were uttering, and not taking her
supplicating and caressing eyes off him.
He glanced at her; she blushed, and ceased speaking.
“I told you I did not know whether I should be here long ... that it
depended on you....”
She dropped her head lower and lower, not knowing herself what answer she
should make to what was coming.
“That it depended on you,” he repeated. “I meant to say ... I
meant to say ... I came for this ... to be my wife!” he brought out, not
knowing what he was saying; but feeling that the most terrible thing was said,
he stopped short and looked at her....
She was breathing heavily, not looking at him. She was feeling ecstasy. Her
soul was flooded with happiness. She had never anticipated that the utterance
of love would produce such a powerful effect on her. But it lasted only an
instant. She remembered Vronsky. She lifted her clear, truthful eyes, and
seeing his desperate face, she answered hastily:
“That cannot be ... forgive me.”
A moment ago, and how close she had been to him, of what importance in his
life! And how aloof and remote from him she had become now!
“It was bound to be so,” he said, not looking at her.
He bowed, and was meaning to retreat.
But at that very moment the princess came in. There was a look of horror on her
face when she saw them alone, and their disturbed faces. Levin bowed to her,
and said nothing. Kitty did not speak nor lift her eyes. “Thank God, she
has refused him,” thought the mother, and her face lighted up with the
habitual smile with which she greeted her guests on Thursdays. She sat down and
began questioning Levin about his life in the country. He sat down again,
waiting for other visitors to arrive, in order to retreat unnoticed.
Five minutes later there came in a friend of Kitty’s, married the
preceding winter, Countess Nordston.
She was a thin, sallow, sickly, and nervous woman, with brilliant black eyes.
She was fond of Kitty, and her affection for her showed itself, as the
affection of married women for girls always does, in the desire to make a match
for Kitty after her own ideal of married happiness; she wanted her to marry
Vronsky. Levin she had often met at the Shtcherbatskys’ early in the
winter, and she had always disliked him. Her invariable and favorite pursuit,
when they met, consisted in making fun of him.
“I do like it when he looks down at me from the height of his grandeur,
or breaks off his learned conversation with me because I’m a fool, or is
condescending to me. I like that so; to see him condescending! I am so glad he
can’t bear me,” she used to say of him.
She was right, for Levin actually could not bear her, and despised her for what
she was proud of and regarded as a fine characteristic—her nervousness,
her delicate contempt and indifference for everything coarse and earthly.
The Countess Nordston and Levin got into that relation with one another not
seldom seen in society, when two persons, who remain externally on friendly
terms, despise each other to such a degree that they cannot even take each
other seriously, and cannot even be offended by each other.
The Countess Nordston pounced upon Levin at once.
“Ah, Konstantin Dmitrievitch! So you’ve come back to our corrupt
Babylon,” she said, giving him her tiny, yellow hand, and recalling what
he had chanced to say early in the winter, that Moscow was a Babylon.
“Come, is Babylon reformed, or have you degenerated?” she added,
glancing with a simper at Kitty.
“It’s very flattering for me, countess, that you remember my words
so well,” responded Levin, who had succeeded in recovering his composure,
and at once from habit dropped into his tone of joking hostility to the
Countess Nordston. “They must certainly make a great impression on
you.”
“Oh, I should think so! I always note them all down. Well, Kitty, have
you been skating again?...”
And she began talking to Kitty. Awkward as it was for Levin to withdraw now, it
would still have been easier for him to perpetrate this awkwardness than to
remain all the evening and see Kitty, who glanced at him now and then and
avoided his eyes. He was on the point of getting up, when the princess,
noticing that he was silent, addressed him.
“Shall you be long in Moscow? You’re busy with the district
council, though, aren’t you, and can’t be away for long?”
“No, princess, I’m no longer a member of the council,” he
said. “I have come up for a few days.”
“There’s something the matter with him,” thought Countess
Nordston, glancing at his stern, serious face. “He isn’t in his old
argumentative mood. But I’ll draw him out. I do love making a fool of him
before Kitty, and I’ll do it.”
“Konstantin Dmitrievitch,” she said to him, “do explain to
me, please, what’s the meaning of it. You know all about such things. At
home in our village of Kaluga all the peasants and all the women have drunk up
all they possessed, and now they can’t pay us any rent. What’s the
meaning of that? You always praise the peasants so.”
At that instant another lady came into the room, and Levin got up.
“Excuse me, countess, but I really know nothing about it, and can’t
tell you anything,” he said, and looked round at the officer who came in
behind the lady.
“That must be Vronsky,” thought Levin, and, to be sure of it,
glanced at Kitty. She had already had time to look at Vronsky, and looked round
at Levin. And simply from the look in her eyes, that grew unconsciously
brighter, Levin knew that she loved that man, knew it as surely as if she had
told him so in words. But what sort of a man was he? Now, whether for good or
for ill, Levin could not choose but remain; he must find out what the man was
like whom she loved.
There are people who, on meeting a successful rival, no matter in what, are at
once disposed to turn their backs on everything good in him, and to see only
what is bad. There are people, on the other hand, who desire above all to find
in that lucky rival the qualities by which he has outstripped them, and seek
with a throbbing ache at heart only what is good. Levin belonged to the second
class. But he had no difficulty in finding what was good and attractive in
Vronsky. It was apparent at the first glance. Vronsky was a squarely built,
dark man, not very tall, with a good-humored, handsome, and exceedingly calm
and resolute face. Everything about his face and figure, from his short-cropped
black hair and freshly shaven chin down to his loosely fitting, brand-new
uniform, was simple and at the same time elegant. Making way for the lady who
had come in, Vronsky went up to the princess and then to Kitty.
As he approached her, his beautiful eyes shone with a specially tender light,
and with a faint, happy, and modestly triumphant smile (so it seemed to Levin),
bowing carefully and respectfully over her, he held out his small broad hand to
her.
Greeting and saying a few words to everyone, he sat down without once glancing
at Levin, who had never taken his eyes off him.
“Let me introduce you,” said the princess, indicating Levin.
“Konstantin Dmitrievitch Levin, Count Alexey Kirillovitch Vronsky.”
Vronsky got up and, looking cordially at Levin, shook hands with him.
“I believe I was to have dined with you this winter,” he said,
smiling his simple and open smile; “but you had unexpectedly left for the
country.”
“Konstantin Dmitrievitch despises and hates town and us
townspeople,” said Countess Nordston.
“My words must make a deep impression on you, since you remember them so
well,” said Levin, and, suddenly conscious that he had said just the same
thing before, he reddened.
Vronsky looked at Levin and Countess Nordston, and smiled.
“Are you always in the country?” he inquired. “I should think
it must be dull in the winter.”
“It’s not dull if one has work to do; besides, one’s not dull
by oneself,” Levin replied abruptly.
“I am fond of the country,” said Vronsky, noticing, and affecting
not to notice, Levin’s tone.
“But I hope, count, you would not consent to live in the country
always,” said Countess Nordston.
“I don’t know; I have never tried for long. I experienced a queer
feeling once,” he went on. “I never longed so for the country,
Russian country, with bast shoes and peasants, as when I was spending a winter
with my mother in Nice. Nice itself is dull enough, you know. And indeed,
Naples and Sorrento are only pleasant for a short time. And it’s just
there that Russia comes back to me most vividly, and especially the country.
It’s as though....”
He talked on, addressing both Kitty and Levin, turning his serene, friendly
eyes from one to the other, and saying obviously just what came into his head.
Noticing that Countess Nordston wanted to say something, he stopped short
without finishing what he had begun, and listened attentively to her.
The conversation did not flag for an instant, so that the princess, who always
kept in reserve, in case a subject should be lacking, two heavy guns—the
relative advantages of classical and of modern education, and universal
military service—had not to move out either of them, while Countess
Nordston had not a chance of chaffing Levin.
Levin wanted to, and could not, take part in the general conversation; saying
to himself every instant, “Now go,” he still did not go, as though
waiting for something.
The conversation fell upon table-turning and spirits, and Countess Nordston,
who believed in spiritualism, began to describe the marvels she had seen.
“Ah, countess, you really must take me, for pity’s sake do take me
to see them! I have never seen anything extraordinary, though I am always on
the lookout for it everywhere,” said Vronsky, smiling.
“Very well, next Saturday,” answered Countess Nordston. “But
you, Konstantin Dmitrievitch, do you believe in it?” she asked Levin.
“Why do you ask me? You know what I shall say.”
“But I want to hear your opinion.”
“My opinion,” answered Levin, “is only that this
table-turning simply proves that educated society—so called—is no
higher than the peasants. They believe in the evil eye, and in witchcraft and
omens, while we....”
“Oh, then you don’t believe in it?”
“I can’t believe in it, countess.”
“But if I’ve seen it myself?”
“The peasant women too tell us they have seen goblins.”
“Then you think I tell a lie?”
And she laughed a mirthless laugh.
“Oh, no, Masha, Konstantin Dmitrievitch said he could not believe in
it,” said Kitty, blushing for Levin, and Levin saw this, and, still more
exasperated, would have answered, but Vronsky with his bright frank smile
rushed to the support of the conversation, which was threatening to become
disagreeable.
“You do not admit the conceivability at all?” he queried.
“But why not? We admit the existence of electricity, of which we know
nothing. Why should there not be some new force, still unknown to us,
which....”
“When electricity was discovered,” Levin interrupted hurriedly,
“it was only the phenomenon that was discovered, and it was unknown from
what it proceeded and what were its effects, and ages passed before its
applications were conceived. But the spiritualists have begun with tables
writing for them, and spirits appearing to them, and have only later started
saying that it is an unknown force.”
Vronsky listened attentively to Levin, as he always did listen, obviously
interested in his words.
“Yes, but the spiritualists say we don’t know at present what this
force is, but there is a force, and these are the conditions in which it acts.
Let the scientific men find out what the force consists in. No, I don’t
see why there should not be a new force, if it....”
“Why, because with electricity,” Levin interrupted again,
“every time you rub tar against wool, a recognized phenomenon is
manifested, but in this case it does not happen every time, and so it follows
it is not a natural phenomenon.”
Feeling probably that the conversation was taking a tone too serious for a
drawing-room, Vronsky made no rejoinder, but by way of trying to change the
conversation, he smiled brightly, and turned to the ladies.
“Do let us try at once, countess,” he said; but Levin would finish
saying what he thought.
“I think,” he went on, “that this attempt of the
spiritualists to explain their marvels as some sort of new natural force is
most futile. They boldly talk of spiritual force, and then try to subject it to
material experiment.”
Everyone was waiting for him to finish, and he felt it.
“And I think you would be a first-rate medium,” said Countess
Nordston; “there’s something enthusiastic in you.”
Levin opened his mouth, was about to say something, reddened, and said nothing.
“Do let us try table-turning at once, please,” said Vronsky.
“Princess, will you allow it?”
And Vronsky stood up, looking for a little table.
Kitty got up to fetch a table, and as she passed, her eyes met Levin’s.
She felt for him with her whole heart, the more because she was pitying him for
suffering of which she was herself the cause. “If you can forgive me,
forgive me,” said her eyes, “I am so happy.”
“I hate them all, and you, and myself,” his eyes responded, and he
took up his hat. But he was not destined to escape. Just as they were arranging
themselves round the table, and Levin was on the point of retiring, the old
prince came in, and after greeting the ladies, addressed Levin.
“Ah!” he began joyously. “Been here long, my boy? I
didn’t even know you were in town. Very glad to see you.” The old
prince embraced Levin, and talking to him did not observe Vronsky, who had
risen, and was serenely waiting till the prince should turn to him.
Kitty felt how distasteful her father’s warmth was to Levin after what
had happened. She saw, too, how coldly her father responded at last to
Vronsky’s bow, and how Vronsky looked with amiable perplexity at her
father, as though trying and failing to understand how and why anyone could be
hostilely disposed towards him, and she flushed.
“Prince, let us have Konstantin Dmitrievitch,” said Countess
Nordston; “we want to try an experiment.”
“What experiment? Table-turning? Well, you must excuse me, ladies and
gentlemen, but to my mind it is better fun to play the ring game,” said
the old prince, looking at Vronsky, and guessing that it had been his
suggestion. “There’s some sense in that, anyway.”
Vronsky looked wonderingly at the prince with his resolute eyes, and, with a
faint smile, began immediately talking to Countess Nordston of the great ball
that was to come off next week.
“I hope you will be there?” he said to Kitty. As soon as the old
prince turned away from him, Levin went out unnoticed, and the last impression
he carried away with him of that evening was the smiling, happy face of Kitty
answering Vronsky’s inquiry about the ball.
At the end of the evening Kitty told her mother of her conversation with Levin,
and in spite of all the pity she felt for Levin, she was glad at the thought
that she had received an offer. She had no doubt that she had acted
rightly. But after she had gone to bed, for a long while she could not sleep.
One impression pursued her relentlessly. It was Levin’s face, with his
scowling brows, and his kind eyes looking out in dark dejection below them, as
he stood listening to her father, and glancing at her and at Vronsky. And she
felt so sorry for him that tears came into her eyes. But immediately she
thought of the man for whom she had given him up. She vividly recalled his
manly, resolute face, his noble self-possession, and the good nature
conspicuous in everything towards everyone. She remembered the love for her of
the man she loved, and once more all was gladness in her soul, and she lay on
the pillow, smiling with happiness. “I’m sorry, I’m sorry;
but what could I do? It’s not my fault,” she said to herself; but
an inner voice told her something else. Whether she felt remorse at having won
Levin’s love, or at having refused him, she did not know. But her
happiness was poisoned by doubts. “Lord, have pity on us; Lord, have pity
on us; Lord, have pity on us!” she repeated to herself, till she fell
asleep.
Meanwhile there took place below, in the prince’s little library, one of
the scenes so often repeated between the parents on account of their favorite
daughter.
“What? I’ll tell you what!” shouted the prince, waving his
arms, and at once wrapping his squirrel-lined dressing-gown round him again.
“That you’ve no pride, no dignity; that you’re disgracing,
ruining your daughter by this vulgar, stupid matchmaking!”
“But, really, for mercy’s sake, prince, what have I done?”
said the princess, almost crying.
She, pleased and happy after her conversation with her daughter, had gone to
the prince to say good-night as usual, and though she had no intention of
telling him of Levin’s offer and Kitty’s refusal, still she hinted
to her husband that she fancied things were practically settled with Vronsky,
and that he would declare himself so soon as his mother arrived. And thereupon,
at those words, the prince had all at once flown into a passion, and began to
use unseemly language.
“What have you done? I’ll tell you what. First of all, you’re
trying to catch an eligible gentleman, and all Moscow will be talking of it,
and with good reason. If you have evening parties, invite everyone, don’t
pick out the possible suitors. Invite all the young bucks. Engage a piano
player, and let them dance, and not as you do things nowadays, hunting up good
matches. It makes me sick, sick to see it, and you’ve gone on till
you’ve turned the poor wench’s head. Levin’s a thousand times
the better man. As for this little Petersburg swell, they’re turned out
by machinery, all on one pattern, and all precious rubbish. But if he were a
prince of the blood, my daughter need not run after anyone.”
“But what have I done?”
“Why, you’ve....” The prince was crying wrathfully.
“I know if one were to listen to you,” interrupted the princess,
“we should never marry our daughter. If it’s to be so, we’d
better go into the country.”
“Well, and we had better.”
“But do wait a minute. Do I try and catch them? I don’t try to
catch them in the least. A young man, and a very nice one, has fallen in love
with her, and she, I fancy....”
“Oh, yes, you fancy! And how if she really is in love, and he’s no
more thinking of marriage than I am!... Oh, that I should live to see it! Ah!
spiritualism! Ah! Nice! Ah! the ball!” And the prince, imagining that he
was mimicking his wife, made a mincing curtsey at each word. “And this is
how we’re preparing wretchedness for Kitty; and she’s really got
the notion into her head....”
“But what makes you suppose so?”
“I don’t suppose; I know. We have eyes for such things, though
women-folk haven’t. I see a man who has serious intentions, that’s
Levin: and I see a peacock, like this feather-head, who’s only amusing
himself.”
“Oh, well, when once you get an idea into your head!...”
“Well, you’ll remember my words, but too late, just as with
Dolly.”
“Well, well, we won’t talk of it,” the princess stopped him,
recollecting her unlucky Dolly.
“By all means, and good-night!”
And signing each other with the cross, the husband and wife parted with a kiss,
feeling that they each remained of their own opinion.
The princess had at first been quite certain that that evening had settled
Kitty’s future, and that there could be no doubt of Vronsky’s
intentions, but her husband’s words had disturbed her. And returning to
her own room, in terror before the unknown future, she, too, like Kitty,
repeated several times in her heart, “Lord, have pity; Lord, have pity;
Lord, have pity.”
Vronsky had never had a real home life. His mother had been in her youth a
brilliant society woman, who had had during her married life, and still more
afterwards, many love affairs notorious in the whole fashionable world. His
father he scarcely remembered, and he had been educated in the Corps of Pages.
Leaving the school very young as a brilliant officer, he had at once got into
the circle of wealthy Petersburg army men. Although he did go more or less into
Petersburg society, his love affairs had always hitherto been outside it.
In Moscow he had for the first time felt, after his luxurious and coarse life
at Petersburg, all the charm of intimacy with a sweet and innocent girl of his
own rank, who cared for him. It never even entered his head that there could be
any harm in his relations with Kitty. At balls he danced principally with her.
He was a constant visitor at their house. He talked to her as people commonly
do talk in society—all sorts of nonsense, but nonsense to which he could
not help attaching a special meaning in her case. Although he said nothing to
her that he could not have said before everybody, he felt that she was becoming
more and more dependent upon him, and the more he felt this, the better he
liked it, and the tenderer was his feeling for her. He did not know that his
mode of behavior in relation to Kitty had a definite character, that it is
courting young girls with no intention of marriage, and that such courting is
one of the evil actions common among brilliant young men such as he was. It
seemed to him that he was the first who had discovered this pleasure, and he
was enjoying his discovery.
If he could have heard what her parents were saying that evening, if he could
have put himself at the point of view of the family and have heard that Kitty
would be unhappy if he did not marry her, he would have been greatly
astonished, and would not have believed it. He could not believe that what gave
such great and delicate pleasure to him, and above all to her, could be wrong.
Still less could he have believed that he ought to marry.
Marriage had never presented itself to him as a possibility. He not only
disliked family life, but a family, and especially a husband was, in accordance
with the views general in the bachelor world in which he lived, conceived as
something alien, repellant, and, above all, ridiculous.
But though Vronsky had not the least suspicion what the parents were saying, he
felt on coming away from the Shtcherbatskys’ that the secret spiritual
bond which existed between him and Kitty had grown so much stronger that
evening that some step must be taken. But what step could and ought to be taken
he could not imagine.
“What is so exquisite,” he thought, as he returned from the
Shtcherbatskys’, carrying away with him, as he always did, a delicious
feeling of purity and freshness, arising partly from the fact that he had not
been smoking for a whole evening, and with it a new feeling of tenderness at
her love for him—“what is so exquisite is that not a word has been
said by me or by her, but we understand each other so well in this unseen
language of looks and tones, that this evening more clearly than ever she told
me she loves me. And how secretly, simply, and most of all, how trustfully! I
feel myself better, purer. I feel that I have a heart, and that there is a
great deal of good in me. Those sweet, loving eyes! When she said:
‘Indeed I do....’
“Well, what then? Oh, nothing. It’s good for me, and good for
her.” And he began wondering where to finish the evening.
He passed in review of the places he might go to. “Club? a game of
bezique, champagne with Ignatov? No, I’m not going. Château des
Fleurs; there I shall find Oblonsky, songs, the cancan. No, I’m sick
of it. That’s why I like the Shtcherbatskys’, that I’m
growing better. I’ll go home.” He went straight to his room at
Dussots’ Hotel, ordered supper, and then undressed, and as soon as his
head touched the pillow, fell into a sound sleep.
Next day at eleven o’clock in the morning Vronsky drove to the station of
the Petersburg railway to meet his mother, and the first person he came across
on the great flight of steps was Oblonsky, who was expecting his sister by the
same train.
“Ah! your excellency!” cried Oblonsky, “whom are you
meeting?”
“My mother,” Vronsky responded, smiling, as everyone did who met
Oblonsky. He shook hands with him, and together they ascended the steps.
“She is to be here from Petersburg today.”
“I was looking out for you till two o’clock last night. Where did
you go after the Shtcherbatskys’?”
“Home,” answered Vronsky. “I must own I felt so well content
yesterday after the Shtcherbatskys’ that I didn’t care to go
anywhere.”
“I know a gallant steed by tokens sure,
And by his eyes I know a youth in love,”
declaimed Stepan Arkadyevitch, just as he had done before to Levin.
Vronsky smiled with a look that seemed to say that he did not deny it, but he
promptly changed the subject.
“And whom are you meeting?” he asked.
“I? I’ve come to meet a pretty woman,” said Oblonsky.
“You don’t say so!”
“Honi soit qui mal y pense! My sister Anna.”
“Ah! that’s Madame Karenina,” said Vronsky.
“You know her, no doubt?”
“I think I do. Or perhaps not ... I really am not sure,” Vronsky
answered heedlessly, with a vague recollection of something stiff and tedious
evoked by the name Karenina.
“But Alexey Alexandrovitch, my celebrated brother-in-law, you surely must
know. All the world knows him.”
“I know him by reputation and by sight. I know that he’s clever,
learned, religious somewhat.... But you know that’s not ... not in my
line,” said Vronsky in English.
“Yes, he’s a very remarkable man; rather a conservative, but a
splendid man,” observed Stepan Arkadyevitch, “a splendid
man.”
“Oh, well, so much the better for him,” said Vronsky smiling.
“Oh, you’ve come,” he said, addressing a tall old footman of
his mother’s, standing at the door; “come here.”
Besides the charm Oblonsky had in general for everyone, Vronsky had felt of
late specially drawn to him by the fact that in his imagination he was
associated with Kitty.
“Well, what do you say? Shall we give a supper on Sunday for the
diva?” he said to him with a smile, taking his arm.
“Of course. I’m collecting subscriptions. Oh, did you make the
acquaintance of my friend Levin?” asked Stepan Arkadyevitch.
“Yes; but he left rather early.”
“He’s a capital fellow,” pursued Oblonsky. “Isn’t
he?”
“I don’t know why it is,” responded Vronsky, “in all
Moscow people—present company of course excepted,” he put in
jestingly, “there’s something uncompromising. They are all on the
defensive, lose their tempers, as though they all want to make one feel
something....”
“Yes, that’s true, it is so,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch,
laughing good-humoredly.
“Will the train soon be in?” Vronsky asked a railway official.
“The train’s signaled,” answered the man.
The approach of the train was more and more evident by the preparatory bustle
in the station, the rush of porters, the movement of policemen and attendants,
and people meeting the train. Through the frosty vapor could be seen workmen in
short sheepskins and soft felt boots crossing the rails of the curving line.
The hiss of the boiler could be heard on the distant rails, and the rumble of
something heavy.
“No,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, who felt a great inclination to
tell Vronsky of Levin’s intentions in regard to Kitty. “No,
you’ve not got a true impression of Levin. He’s a very nervous man,
and is sometimes out of humor, it’s true, but then he is often very nice.
He’s such a true, honest nature, and a heart of gold. But yesterday there
were special reasons,” pursued Stepan Arkadyevitch, with a meaning smile,
totally oblivious of the genuine sympathy he had felt the day before for his
friend, and feeling the same sympathy now, only for Vronsky. “Yes, there
were reasons why he could not help being either particularly happy or
particularly unhappy.”
Vronsky stood still and asked directly: “How so? Do you mean he made your
belle-sœur an offer yesterday?”
“Maybe,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch. “I fancied something of
the sort yesterday. Yes, if he went away early, and was out of humor too, it
must mean it.... He’s been so long in love, and I’m very sorry for
him.”
“So that’s it! I should imagine, though, she might reckon on a
better match,” said Vronsky, drawing himself up and walking about again,
“though I don’t know him, of course,” he added. “Yes,
that is a hateful position! That’s why most fellows prefer to have to do
with Klaras. If you don’t succeed with them it only proves that
you’ve not enough cash, but in this case one’s dignity’s at
stake. But here’s the train.”
The engine had already whistled in the distance. A few instants later the
platform was quivering, and with puffs of steam hanging low in the air from the
frost, the engine rolled up, with the lever of the middle wheel rhythmically
moving up and down, and the stooping figure of the engine-driver covered with
frost. Behind the tender, setting the platform more and more slowly swaying,
came the luggage van with a dog whining in it. At last the passenger carriages
rolled in, oscillating before coming to a standstill.
A smart guard jumped out, giving a whistle, and after him one by one the
impatient passengers began to get down: an officer of the guards, holding
himself erect, and looking severely about him; a nimble little merchant with a
satchel, smiling gaily; a peasant with a sack over his shoulder.
Vronsky, standing beside Oblonsky, watched the carriages and the passengers,
totally oblivious of his mother. What he had just heard about Kitty excited and
delighted him. Unconsciously he arched his chest, and his eyes flashed. He felt
himself a conqueror.
“Countess Vronskaya is in that compartment,” said the smart guard,
going up to Vronsky.
The guard’s words roused him, and forced him to think of his mother and
his approaching meeting with her. He did not in his heart respect his mother,
and without acknowledging it to himself, he did not love her, though in
accordance with the ideas of the set in which he lived, and with his own
education, he could not have conceived of any behavior to his mother not in the
highest degree respectful and obedient, and the more externally obedient and
respectful his behavior, the less in his heart he respected and loved her.
Vronsky followed the guard to the carriage, and at the door of the compartment
he stopped short to make room for a lady who was getting out.
With the insight of a man of the world, from one glance at this lady’s
appearance Vronsky classified her as belonging to the best society. He begged
pardon, and was getting into the carriage, but felt he must glance at her once
more; not that she was very beautiful, not on account of the elegance and
modest grace which were apparent in her whole figure, but because in the
expression of her charming face, as she passed close by him, there was
something peculiarly caressing and soft. As he looked round, she too turned her
head. Her shining gray eyes, that looked dark from the thick lashes, rested
with friendly attention on his face, as though she were recognizing him, and
then promptly turned away to the passing crowd, as though seeking someone. In
that brief look Vronsky had time to notice the suppressed eagerness which
played over her face, and flitted between the brilliant eyes and the faint
smile that curved her red lips. It was as though her nature were so brimming
over with something that against her will it showed itself now in the flash of
her eyes, and now in her smile. Deliberately she shrouded the light in her
eyes, but it shone against her will in the faintly perceptible smile.
Vronsky stepped into the carriage. His mother, a dried-up old lady with black
eyes and ringlets, screwed up her eyes, scanning her son, and smiled slightly
with her thin lips. Getting up from the seat and handing her maid a bag, she
gave her little wrinkled hand to her son to kiss, and lifting his head from her
hand, kissed him on the cheek.
“You got my telegram? Quite well? Thank God.”
“You had a good journey?” said her son, sitting down beside her,
and involuntarily listening to a woman’s voice outside the door. He knew
it was the voice of the lady he had met at the door.
“All the same I don’t agree with you,” said the lady’s
voice.
“It’s the Petersburg view, madame.”
“Not Petersburg, but simply feminine,” she responded.
“Well, well, allow me to kiss your hand.”
“Good-bye, Ivan Petrovitch. And could you see if my brother is here, and
send him to me?” said the lady in the doorway, and stepped back again
into the compartment.
“Well, have you found your brother?” said Countess Vronskaya,
addressing the lady.
Vronsky understood now that this was Madame Karenina.
“Your brother is here,” he said, standing up. “Excuse me, I
did not know you, and, indeed, our acquaintance was so slight,” said
Vronsky, bowing, “that no doubt you do not remember me.”
“Oh, no,” said she, “I should have known you because your
mother and I have been talking, I think, of nothing but you all the way.”
As she spoke she let the eagerness that would insist on coming out show itself
in her smile. “And still no sign of my brother.”
“Do call him, Alexey,” said the old countess. Vronsky stepped out
onto the platform and shouted:
“Oblonsky! Here!”
Madame Karenina, however, did not wait for her brother, but catching sight of
him she stepped out with her light, resolute step. And as soon as her brother
had reached her, with a gesture that struck Vronsky by its decision and its
grace, she flung her left arm around his neck, drew him rapidly to her, and
kissed him warmly. Vronsky gazed, never taking his eyes from her, and smiled,
he could not have said why. But recollecting that his mother was waiting for
him, he went back again into the carriage.
“She’s very sweet, isn’t she?” said the countess of
Madame Karenina. “Her husband put her with me, and I was delighted to
have her. We’ve been talking all the way. And so you, I hear ... vous
filez le parfait amour. Tant mieux, mon cher, tant mieux.”
“I don’t know what you are referring to, maman,” he answered
coldly. “Come, maman, let us go.”
Madame Karenina entered the carriage again to say good-bye to the countess.
“Well, countess, you have met your son, and I my brother,” she
said. “And all my gossip is exhausted. I should have nothing more to tell
you.”
“Oh, no,” said the countess, taking her hand. “I could go all
around the world with you and never be dull. You are one of those delightful
women in whose company it’s sweet to be silent as well as to talk. Now
please don’t fret over your son; you can’t expect never to be
parted.”
Madame Karenina stood quite still, holding herself very erect, and her eyes
were smiling.
“Anna Arkadyevna,” the countess said in explanation to her son,
“has a little son eight years old, I believe, and she has never been
parted from him before, and she keeps fretting over leaving him.”
“Yes, the countess and I have been talking all the time, I of my son and
she of hers,” said Madame Karenina, and again a smile lighted up her
face, a caressing smile intended for him.
“I am afraid that you must have been dreadfully bored,” he said,
promptly catching the ball of coquetry she had flung him. But apparently she
did not care to pursue the conversation in that strain, and she turned to the
old countess.
“Thank you so much. The time has passed so quickly. Good-bye,
countess.”
“Good-bye, my love,” answered the countess. “Let me have a
kiss of your pretty face. I speak plainly, at my age, and I tell you simply
that I’ve lost my heart to you.”
Stereotyped as the phrase was, Madame Karenina obviously believed it and was
delighted by it. She flushed, bent down slightly, and put her cheek to the
countess’s lips, drew herself up again, and with the same smile
fluttering between her lips and her eyes, she gave her hand to Vronsky. He
pressed the little hand she gave him, and was delighted, as though at something
special, by the energetic squeeze with which she freely and vigorously shook
his hand. She went out with the rapid step which bore her rather
fully-developed figure with such strange lightness.
“Very charming,” said the countess.
That was just what her son was thinking. His eyes followed her till her
graceful figure was out of sight, and then the smile remained on his face. He
saw out of the window how she went up to her brother, put her arm in his, and
began telling him something eagerly, obviously something that had nothing to do
with him, Vronsky, and at that he felt annoyed.
“Well, maman, are you perfectly well?” he repeated, turning to his
mother.
“Everything has been delightful. Alexander has been very good, and Marie
has grown very pretty. She’s very interesting.”
And she began telling him again of what interested her most—the
christening of her grandson, for which she had been staying in Petersburg, and
the special favor shown her elder son by the Tsar.
“Here’s Lavrenty,” said Vronsky, looking out of the window;
“now we can go, if you like.”
The old butler, who had traveled with the countess, came to the carriage to
announce that everything was ready, and the countess got up to go.
“Come; there’s not such a crowd now,” said Vronsky.
The maid took a handbag and the lap dog, the butler and a porter the other
baggage. Vronsky gave his mother his arm; but just as they were getting out of
the carriage several men ran suddenly by with panic-stricken faces. The
station-master, too, ran by in his extraordinary colored cap. Obviously
something unusual had happened. The crowd who had left the train were running
back again.
“What?... What?... Where?... Flung himself!... Crushed!...” was
heard among the crowd. Stepan Arkadyevitch, with his sister on his arm, turned
back. They too looked scared, and stopped at the carriage door to avoid the
crowd.
The ladies got in, while Vronsky and Stepan Arkadyevitch followed the crowd to
find out details of the disaster.
A guard, either drunk or too much muffled up in the bitter frost, had not heard
the train moving back, and had been crushed.
Before Vronsky and Oblonsky came back the ladies heard the facts from the
butler.
Oblonsky and Vronsky had both seen the mutilated corpse. Oblonsky was evidently
upset. He frowned and seemed ready to cry.
“Ah, how awful! Ah, Anna, if you had seen it! Ah, how awful!” he
said.
Vronsky did not speak; his handsome face was serious, but perfectly composed.
“Oh, if you had seen it, countess,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch.
“And his wife was there.... It was awful to see her!... She flung
herself on the body. They say he was the only support of an immense family. How
awful!”
“Couldn’t one do anything for her?” said Madame Karenina in
an agitated whisper.
Vronsky glanced at her, and immediately got out of the carriage.
“I’ll be back directly, maman,” he remarked, turning round in
the doorway.
When he came back a few minutes later, Stepan Arkadyevitch was already in
conversation with the countess about the new singer, while the countess was
impatiently looking towards the door, waiting for her son.
“Now let us be off,” said Vronsky, coming in. They went out
together. Vronsky was in front with his mother. Behind walked Madame Karenina
with her brother. Just as they were going out of the station the station-master
overtook Vronsky.
“You gave my assistant two hundred roubles. Would you kindly explain for
whose benefit you intend them?”
“For the widow,” said Vronsky, shrugging his shoulders. “I
should have thought there was no need to ask.”
“You gave that?” cried Oblonsky, behind, and, pressing his
sister’s hand, he added: “Very nice, very nice! Isn’t he a
splendid fellow? Good-bye, countess.”
And he and his sister stood still, looking for her maid.
When they went out the Vronsky’s carriage had already driven away. People
coming in were still talking of what happened.
“What a horrible death!” said a gentleman, passing by. “They
say he was cut in two pieces.”
“On the contrary, I think it’s the
easiest—instantaneous,” observed another.
“How is it they don’t take proper precautions?” said a third.
Madame Karenina seated herself in the carriage, and Stepan Arkadyevitch saw
with surprise that her lips were quivering, and she was with difficulty
restraining her tears.
“What is it, Anna?” he asked, when they had driven a few hundred
yards.
“It’s an omen of evil,” she said.
“What nonsense!” said Stepan Arkadyevitch. “You’ve
come, that’s the chief thing. You can’t conceive how I’m
resting my hopes on you.”
“Have you known Vronsky long?” she asked.
“Yes. You know we’re hoping he will marry Kitty.”
“Yes?” said Anna softly. “Come now, let us talk of
you,” she added, tossing her head, as though she would physically shake
off something superfluous oppressing her. “Let us talk of your affairs. I
got your letter, and here I am.”
“Yes, all my hopes are in you,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch.
“Well, tell me all about it.”
And Stepan Arkadyevitch began to tell his story.
On reaching home Oblonsky helped his sister out, sighed, pressed her hand, and
set off to his office.
When Anna went into the room, Dolly was sitting in the little drawing-room with
a white-headed fat little boy, already like his father, giving him a lesson in
French reading. As the boy read, he kept twisting and trying to tear off a
button that was nearly off his jacket. His mother had several times taken his
hand from it, but the fat little hand went back to the button again. His mother
pulled the button off and put it in her pocket.
“Keep your hands still, Grisha,” she said, and she took up her
work, a coverlet she had long been making. She always set to work on it at
depressed moments, and now she knitted at it nervously, twitching her fingers
and counting the stitches. Though she had sent word the day before to her
husband that it was nothing to her whether his sister came or not, she had made
everything ready for her arrival, and was expecting her sister-in-law with
emotion.
Dolly was crushed by her sorrow, utterly swallowed up by it. Still she did not
forget that Anna, her sister-in-law, was the wife of one of the most important
personages in Petersburg, and was a Petersburg grande dame. And, thanks
to this circumstance, she did not carry out her threat to her
husband—that is to say, she remembered that her sister-in-law was coming.
“And, after all, Anna is in no wise to blame,” thought Dolly.
“I know nothing of her except the very best, and I have seen nothing but
kindness and affection from her towards myself.” It was true that as far
as she could recall her impressions at Petersburg at the Karenins’, she
did not like their household itself; there was something artificial in the
whole framework of their family life. “But why should I not receive her?
If only she doesn’t take it into her head to console me!” thought
Dolly. “All consolation and counsel and Christian forgiveness, all that I
have thought over a thousand times, and it’s all no use.”
All these days Dolly had been alone with her children. She did not want to talk
of her sorrow, but with that sorrow in her heart she could not talk of outside
matters. She knew that in one way or another she would tell Anna everything,
and she was alternately glad at the thought of speaking freely, and angry at
the necessity of speaking of her humiliation with her, his sister, and of
hearing her ready-made phrases of good advice and comfort. She had been on the
lookout for her, glancing at her watch every minute, and, as so often happens,
let slip just that minute when her visitor arrived, so that she did not hear
the bell.
Catching a sound of skirts and light steps at the door, she looked round, and
her care-worn face unconsciously expressed not gladness, but wonder. She got up
and embraced her sister-in-law.
“What, here already!” she said as she kissed her.
“Dolly, how glad I am to see you!”
“I am glad, too,” said Dolly, faintly smiling, and trying by the
expression of Anna’s face to find out whether she knew. “Most
likely she knows,” she thought, noticing the sympathy in Anna’s
face. “Well, come along, I’ll take you to your room,” she
went on, trying to defer as long as possible the moment of confidences.
“Is this Grisha? Heavens, how he’s grown!” said Anna; and
kissing him, never taking her eyes off Dolly, she stood still and flushed a
little. “No, please, let us stay here.”
She took off her kerchief and her hat, and catching it in a lock of her black
hair, which was a mass of curls, she tossed her head and shook her hair down.
“You are radiant with health and happiness!” said Dolly, almost
with envy.
“I?... Yes,” said Anna. “Merciful heavens, Tanya!
You’re the same age as my Seryozha,” she added, addressing the
little girl as she ran in. She took her in her arms and kissed her.
“Delightful child, delightful! Show me them all.”
She mentioned them, not only remembering the names, but the years, months,
characters, illnesses of all the children, and Dolly could not but appreciate
that.
“Very well, we will go to them,” she said. “It’s a pity
Vassya’s asleep.”
After seeing the children, they sat down, alone now, in the drawing-room, to
coffee. Anna took the tray, and then pushed it away from her.
“Dolly,” she said, “he has told me.”
Dolly looked coldly at Anna; she was waiting now for phrases of conventional
sympathy, but Anna said nothing of the sort.
“Dolly, dear,” she said, “I don’t want to speak for him
to you, nor to try to comfort you; that’s impossible. But, darling,
I’m simply sorry, sorry from my heart for you!”
Under the thick lashes of her shining eyes tears suddenly glittered. She moved
nearer to her sister-in-law and took her hand in her vigorous little hand.
Dolly did not shrink away, but her face did not lose its frigid expression. She
said:
“To comfort me’s impossible. Everything’s lost after what has
happened, everything’s over!”
And directly she had said this, her face suddenly softened. Anna lifted the
wasted, thin hand of Dolly, kissed it and said:
“But, Dolly, what’s to be done, what’s to be done? How is it
best to act in this awful position—that’s what you must think
of.”
“All’s over, and there’s nothing more,” said Dolly.
“And the worst of all is, you see, that I can’t cast him off: there
are the children, I am tied. And I can’t live with him! it’s a
torture to me to see him.”
“Dolly, darling, he has spoken to me, but I want to hear it from you:
tell me about it.”
Dolly looked at her inquiringly.
Sympathy and love unfeigned were visible on Anna’s face.
“Very well,” she said all at once. “But I will tell you it
from the beginning. You know how I was married. With the education mamma gave
us I was more than innocent, I was stupid. I knew nothing. I know they say men
tell their wives of their former lives, but Stiva”—she corrected
herself—“Stepan Arkadyevitch told me nothing. You’ll hardly
believe it, but till now I imagined that I was the only woman he had known. So
I lived eight years. You must understand that I was so far from suspecting
infidelity, I regarded it as impossible, and then—try to imagine
it—with such ideas, to find out suddenly all the horror, all the
loathsomeness.... You must try and understand me. To be fully convinced of
one’s happiness, and all at once....” continued Dolly, holding back
her sobs, “to get a letter ... his letter to his mistress, my governess.
No, it’s too awful!” She hastily pulled out her handkerchief and
hid her face in it. “I can understand being carried away by
feeling,” she went on after a brief silence, “but deliberately,
slyly deceiving me ... and with whom?... To go on being my husband together
with her ... it’s awful! You can’t understand....”
“Oh, yes, I understand! I understand! Dolly, dearest, I do
understand,” said Anna, pressing her hand.
“And do you imagine he realizes all the awfulness of my position?”
Dolly resumed. “Not the slightest! He’s happy and contented.”
“Oh, no!” Anna interposed quickly. “He’s to be pitied,
he’s weighed down by remorse....”
“Is he capable of remorse?” Dolly interrupted, gazing intently into
her sister-in-law’s face.
“Yes. I know him. I could not look at him without feeling sorry for him.
We both know him. He’s good-hearted, but he’s proud, and now
he’s so humiliated. What touched me most....” (and here Anna guessed
what would touch Dolly most) “he’s tortured by two things: that
he’s ashamed for the children’s sake, and that, loving
you—yes, yes, loving you beyond everything on earth,” she hurriedly
interrupted Dolly, who would have answered—“he has hurt you,
pierced you to the heart. ‘No, no, she cannot forgive me,’ he keeps
saying.”
Dolly looked dreamily away beyond her sister-in-law as she listened to her
words.
“Yes, I can see that his position is awful; it’s worse for the
guilty than the innocent,” she said, “if he feels that all the
misery comes from his fault. But how am I to forgive him, how am I to be his
wife again after her? For me to live with him now would be torture, just
because I love my past love for him....”
And sobs cut short her words. But as though of set design, each time she was
softened she began to speak again of what exasperated her.
“She’s young, you see, she’s pretty,” she went on.
“Do you know, Anna, my youth and my beauty are gone, taken by whom? By
him and his children. I have worked for him, and all I had has gone in his
service, and now of course any fresh, vulgar creature has more charm for him.
No doubt they talked of me together, or, worse still, they were silent. Do you
understand?”
Again her eyes glowed with hatred.
“And after that he will tell me.... What! can I believe him? Never! No,
everything is over, everything that once made my comfort, the reward of my
work, and my sufferings.... Would you believe it, I was teaching Grisha just
now: once this was a joy to me, now it is a torture. What have I to strive and
toil for? Why are the children here? What’s so awful is that all at once
my heart’s turned, and instead of love and tenderness, I have nothing but
hatred for him; yes, hatred. I could kill him.”
“Darling Dolly, I understand, but don’t torture yourself. You are
so distressed, so overwrought, that you look at many things mistakenly.”
Dolly grew calmer, and for two minutes both were silent.
“What’s to be done? Think for me, Anna, help me. I have thought
over everything, and I see nothing.”
Anna could think of nothing, but her heart responded instantly to each word, to
each change of expression of her sister-in-law.
“One thing I would say,” began Anna. “I am his sister, I know
his character, that faculty of forgetting everything, everything” (she
waved her hand before her forehead), “that faculty for being completely
carried away, but for completely repenting too. He cannot believe it, he cannot
comprehend now how he can have acted as he did.”
“No; he understands, he understood!” Dolly broke in. “But I
... you are forgetting me ... does it make it easier for me?”
“Wait a minute. When he told me, I will own I did not realize all the
awfulness of your position. I saw nothing but him, and that the family was
broken up. I felt sorry for him, but after talking to you, I see it, as a
woman, quite differently. I see your agony, and I can’t tell you how
sorry I am for you! But, Dolly, darling, I fully realize your sufferings, only
there is one thing I don’t know; I don’t know ... I don’t
know how much love there is still in your heart for him. That you
know—whether there is enough for you to be able to forgive him. If there
is, forgive him!”
“No,” Dolly was beginning, but Anna cut her short, kissing her hand
once more.
“I know more of the world than you do,” she said. “I know how
men like Stiva look at it. You speak of his talking of you with her. That never
happened. Such men are unfaithful, but their home and wife are sacred to them.
Somehow or other these women are still looked on with contempt by them, and do
not touch on their feeling for their family. They draw a sort of line that
can’t be crossed between them and their families. I don’t
understand it, but it is so.”
“Yes, but he has kissed her....”
“Dolly, hush, darling. I saw Stiva when he was in love with you. I
remember the time when he came to me and cried, talking of you, and all the
poetry and loftiness of his feeling for you, and I know that the longer he has
lived with you the loftier you have been in his eyes. You know we have
sometimes laughed at him for putting in at every word: ‘Dolly’s a
marvelous woman.’ You have always been a divinity for him, and you are
that still, and this has not been an infidelity of the heart....”
“But if it is repeated?”
“It cannot be, as I understand it....”
“Yes, but could you forgive it?”
“I don’t know, I can’t judge.... Yes, I can,” said
Anna, thinking a moment; and grasping the position in her thought and weighing
it in her inner balance, she added: “Yes, I can, I can, I can. Yes, I
could forgive it. I could not be the same, no; but I could forgive it, and
forgive it as though it had never been, never been at all....”
“Oh, of course,” Dolly interposed quickly, as though saying what
she had more than once thought, “else it would not be forgiveness. If one
forgives, it must be completely, completely. Come, let us go; I’ll take
you to your room,” she said, getting up, and on the way she embraced
Anna. “My dear, how glad I am you came. It has made things better, ever
so much better.”
The whole of that day Anna spent at home, that’s to say at the
Oblonskys’, and received no one, though some of her acquaintances had
already heard of her arrival, and came to call the same day. Anna spent the
whole morning with Dolly and the children. She merely sent a brief note to her
brother to tell him that he must not fail to dine at home. “Come, God is
merciful,” she wrote.
Oblonsky did dine at home: the conversation was general, and his wife, speaking
to him, addressed him as “Stiva,” as she had not done before. In
the relations of the husband and wife the same estrangement still remained, but
there was no talk now of separation, and Stepan Arkadyevitch saw the
possibility of explanation and reconciliation.
Immediately after dinner Kitty came in. She knew Anna Arkadyevna, but only very
slightly, and she came now to her sister’s with some trepidation, at the
prospect of meeting this fashionable Petersburg lady, whom everyone spoke so
highly of. But she made a favorable impression on Anna Arkadyevna—she saw
that at once. Anna was unmistakably admiring her loveliness and her youth:
before Kitty knew where she was she found herself not merely under Anna’s
sway, but in love with her, as young girls do fall in love with older and
married women. Anna was not like a fashionable lady, nor the mother of a boy of
eight years old. In the elasticity of her movements, the freshness and the
unflagging eagerness which persisted in her face, and broke out in her smile
and her glance, she would rather have passed for a girl of twenty, had it not
been for a serious and at times mournful look in her eyes, which struck and
attracted Kitty. Kitty felt that Anna was perfectly simple and was concealing
nothing, but that she had another higher world of interests inaccessible to
her, complex and poetic.
After dinner, when Dolly went away to her own room, Anna rose quickly and went
up to her brother, who was just lighting a cigar.
“Stiva,” she said to him, winking gaily, crossing him and glancing
towards the door, “go, and God help you.”
He threw down the cigar, understanding her, and departed through the doorway.
When Stepan Arkadyevitch had disappeared, she went back to the sofa where she
had been sitting, surrounded by the children. Either because the children saw
that their mother was fond of this aunt, or that they felt a special charm in
her themselves, the two elder ones, and the younger following their lead, as
children so often do, had clung about their new aunt since before dinner, and
would not leave her side. And it had become a sort of game among them to sit as
close as possible to their aunt, to touch her, hold her little hand, kiss it,
play with her ring, or even touch the flounce of her skirt.
“Come, come, as we were sitting before,” said Anna Arkadyevna,
sitting down in her place.
And again Grisha poked his little face under her arm, and nestled with his head
on her gown, beaming with pride and happiness.
“And when is your next ball?” she asked Kitty.
“Next week, and a splendid ball. One of those balls where one always
enjoys oneself.”
“Why, are there balls where one always enjoys oneself?” Anna said,
with tender irony.
“It’s strange, but there are. At the Bobrishtchevs’ one
always enjoys oneself, and at the Nikitins’ too, while at the
Mezhkovs’ it’s always dull. Haven’t you noticed it?”
“No, my dear, for me there are no balls now where one enjoys
oneself,” said Anna, and Kitty detected in her eyes that mysterious world
which was not open to her. “For me there are some less dull and
tiresome.”
“How can you be dull at a ball?”
“Why should not I be dull at a ball?” inquired Anna.
Kitty perceived that Anna knew what answer would follow.
“Because you always look nicer than anyone.”
Anna had the faculty of blushing. She blushed a little, and said:
“In the first place it’s never so; and secondly, if it were, what
difference would it make to me?”
“Are you coming to this ball?” asked Kitty.
“I imagine it won’t be possible to avoid going. Here, take
it,” she said to Tanya, who was pulling the loosely-fitting ring off her
white, slender-tipped finger.
“I shall be so glad if you go. I should so like to see you at a
ball.”
“Anyway, if I do go, I shall comfort myself with the thought that
it’s a pleasure to you ... Grisha, don’t pull my hair. It’s
untidy enough without that,” she said, putting up a straying lock, which
Grisha had been playing with.
“I imagine you at the ball in lilac.”
“And why in lilac precisely?” asked Anna, smiling. “Now,
children, run along, run along. Do you hear? Miss Hoole is calling you to
tea,” she said, tearing the children from her, and sending them off to
the dining-room.
“I know why you press me to come to the ball. You expect a great deal of
this ball, and you want everyone to be there to take part in it.”
“How do you know? Yes.”
“Oh! what a happy time you are at,” pursued Anna. “I
remember, and I know that blue haze like the mist on the mountains in
Switzerland. That mist which covers everything in that blissful time when
childhood is just ending, and out of that vast circle, happy and gay, there is
a path growing narrower and narrower, and it is delightful and alarming to
enter the ballroom, bright and splendid as it is.... Who has not been through
it?”
Kitty smiled without speaking. “But how did she go through it? How I
should like to know all her love story!” thought Kitty, recalling the
unromantic appearance of Alexey Alexandrovitch, her husband.
“I know something. Stiva told me, and I congratulate you. I liked him so
much,” Anna continued. “I met Vronsky at the railway
station.”
“Oh, was he there?” asked Kitty, blushing. “What was it Stiva
told you?”
“Stiva gossiped about it all. And I should be so glad ... I traveled
yesterday with Vronsky’s mother,” she went on; “and his
mother talked without a pause of him, he’s her favorite. I know mothers
are partial, but....”
“What did his mother tell you?”
“Oh, a great deal! And I know that he’s her favorite; still one can
see how chivalrous he is.... Well, for instance, she told me that he had wanted
to give up all his property to his brother, that he had done something
extraordinary when he was quite a child, saved a woman out of the water.
He’s a hero, in fact,” said Anna, smiling and recollecting the two
hundred roubles he had given at the station.
But she did not tell Kitty about the two hundred roubles. For some reason it
was disagreeable to her to think of it. She felt that there was something that
had to do with her in it, and something that ought not to have been.
“She pressed me very much to go and see her,” Anna went on;
“and I shall be glad to go to see her tomorrow. Stiva is staying a long
while in Dolly’s room, thank God,” Anna added, changing the
subject, and getting up, Kitty fancied, displeased with something.
“No, I’m first! No, I!” screamed the children, who had
finished tea, running up to their Aunt Anna.
“All together,” said Anna, and she ran laughing to meet them, and
embraced and swung round all the throng of swarming children, shrieking with
delight.
Dolly came out of her room to the tea of the grown-up people. Stepan
Arkadyevitch did not come out. He must have left his wife’s room by the
other door.
“I am afraid you’ll be cold upstairs,” observed Dolly,
addressing Anna; “I want to move you downstairs, and we shall be
nearer.”
“Oh, please, don’t trouble about me,” answered Anna, looking
intently into Dolly’s face, trying to make out whether there had been a
reconciliation or not.
“It will be lighter for you here,” answered her sister-in-law.
“I assure you that I sleep everywhere, and always like a marmot.”
“What’s the question?” inquired Stepan Arkadyevitch, coming
out of his room and addressing his wife.
From his tone both Kitty and Anna knew that a reconciliation had taken place.
“I want to move Anna downstairs, but we must hang up blinds. No one knows
how to do it; I must see to it myself,” answered Dolly addressing him.
“God knows whether they are fully reconciled,” thought Anna,
hearing her tone, cold and composed.
“Oh, nonsense, Dolly, always making difficulties,” answered her
husband. “Come, I’ll do it all, if you like....”
“Yes, they must be reconciled,” thought Anna.
“I know how you do everything,” answered Dolly. “You tell
Matvey to do what can’t be done, and go away yourself, leaving him to
make a muddle of everything,” and her habitual, mocking smile curved the
corners of Dolly’s lips as she spoke.
“Full, full reconciliation, full,” thought Anna; “thank
God!” and rejoicing that she was the cause of it, she went up to Dolly
and kissed her.
“Not at all. Why do you always look down on me and Matvey?” said
Stepan Arkadyevitch, smiling hardly perceptibly, and addressing his wife.
The whole evening Dolly was, as always, a little mocking in her tone to her
husband, while Stepan Arkadyevitch was happy and cheerful, but not so as to
seem as though, having been forgiven, he had forgotten his offense.
At half-past nine o’clock a particularly joyful and pleasant family
conversation over the tea-table at the Oblonskys’ was broken up by an
apparently simple incident. But this simple incident for some reason struck
everyone as strange. Talking about common acquaintances in Petersburg, Anna got
up quickly.
“She is in my album,” she said; “and, by the way, I’ll
show you my Seryozha,” she added, with a mother’s smile of pride.
Towards ten o’clock, when she usually said good-night to her son, and
often before going to a ball put him to bed herself, she felt depressed at
being so far from him; and whatever she was talking about, she kept coming back
in thought to her curly-headed Seryozha. She longed to look at his photograph
and talk of him. Seizing the first pretext, she got up, and with her light,
resolute step went for her album. The stairs up to her room came out on the
landing of the great warm main staircase.
Just as she was leaving the drawing-room, a ring was heard in the hall.
“Who can that be?” said Dolly.
“It’s early for me to be fetched, and for anyone else it’s
late,” observed Kitty.
“Sure to be someone with papers for me,” put in Stepan
Arkadyevitch. When Anna was passing the top of the staircase, a servant was
running up to announce the visitor, while the visitor himself was standing
under a lamp. Anna glancing down at once recognized Vronsky, and a strange
feeling of pleasure and at the same time of dread of something stirred in her
heart. He was standing still, not taking off his coat, pulling something out of
his pocket. At the instant when she was just facing the stairs, he raised his
eyes, caught sight of her, and into the expression of his face there passed a
shade of embarrassment and dismay. With a slight inclination of her head she
passed, hearing behind her Stepan Arkadyevitch’s loud voice calling him
to come up, and the quiet, soft, and composed voice of Vronsky refusing.
When Anna returned with the album, he was already gone, and Stepan Arkadyevitch
was telling them that he had called to inquire about the dinner they were
giving next day to a celebrity who had just arrived. “And nothing would
induce him to come up. What a queer fellow he is!” added Stepan
Arkadyevitch.
Kitty blushed. She thought that she was the only person who knew why he had
come, and why he would not come up. “He has been at home,” she
thought, “and didn’t find me, and thought I should be here, but he
did not come up because he thought it late, and Anna’s here.”
All of them looked at each other, saying nothing, and began to look at
Anna’s album.
There was nothing either exceptional or strange in a man’s calling at
half-past nine on a friend to inquire details of a proposed dinner party and
not coming in, but it seemed strange to all of them. Above all, it seemed
strange and not right to Anna.
The ball was only just beginning as Kitty and her mother walked up the great
staircase, flooded with light, and lined with flowers and footmen in powder and
red coats. From the rooms came a constant, steady hum, as from a hive, and the
rustle of movement; and while on the landing between trees they gave last
touches to their hair and dresses before the mirror, they heard from the
ballroom the careful, distinct notes of the fiddles of the orchestra beginning
the first waltz. A little old man in civilian dress, arranging his gray curls
before another mirror, and diffusing an odor of scent, stumbled against them on
the stairs, and stood aside, evidently admiring Kitty, whom he did not know. A
beardless youth, one of those society youths whom the old Prince Shtcherbatsky
called “young bucks,” in an exceedingly open waistcoat,
straightening his white tie as he went, bowed to them, and after running by,
came back to ask Kitty for a quadrille. As the first quadrille had already been
given to Vronsky, she had to promise this youth the second. An officer,
buttoning his glove, stood aside in the doorway, and stroking his mustache,
admired rosy Kitty.
Although her dress, her coiffure, and all the preparations for the ball had
cost Kitty great trouble and consideration, at this moment she walked into the
ballroom in her elaborate tulle dress over a pink slip as easily and simply as
though all the rosettes and lace, all the minute details of her attire, had not
cost her or her family a moment’s attention, as though she had been born
in that tulle and lace, with her hair done up high on her head, and a rose and
two leaves on the top of it.
When, just before entering the ballroom, the princess, her mother, tried to
turn right side out of the ribbon of her sash, Kitty had drawn back a little.
She felt that everything must be right of itself, and graceful, and nothing
could need setting straight.
It was one of Kitty’s best days. Her dress was not uncomfortable
anywhere; her lace berthe did not droop anywhere; her rosettes were not crushed
nor torn off; her pink slippers with high, hollowed-out heels did not pinch,
but gladdened her feet; and the thick rolls of fair chignon kept up on her head
as if they were her own hair. All the three buttons buttoned up without tearing
on the long glove that covered her hand without concealing its lines. The black
velvet of her locket nestled with special softness round her neck. That velvet
was delicious; at home, looking at her neck in the looking-glass, Kitty had
felt that that velvet was speaking. About all the rest there might be a doubt,
but the velvet was delicious. Kitty smiled here too, at the ball, when she
glanced at it in the glass. Her bare shoulders and arms gave Kitty a sense of
chill marble, a feeling she particularly liked. Her eyes sparkled, and her rosy
lips could not keep from smiling from the consciousness of her own
attractiveness. She had scarcely entered the ballroom and reached the throng of
ladies, all tulle, ribbons, lace, and flowers, waiting to be asked to
dance—Kitty was never one of that throng—when she was asked for a
waltz, and asked by the best partner, the first star in the hierarchy of the
ballroom, a renowned director of dances, a married man, handsome and
well-built, Yegorushka Korsunsky. He had only just left the Countess Bonina,
with whom he had danced the first half of the waltz, and, scanning his
kingdom—that is to say, a few couples who had started dancing—he
caught sight of Kitty, entering, and flew up to her with that peculiar, easy
amble which is confined to directors of balls. Without even asking her if she
cared to dance, he put out his arm to encircle her slender waist. She looked
round for someone to give her fan to, and their hostess, smiling to her, took
it.
“How nice you’ve come in good time,” he said to her,
embracing her waist; “such a bad habit to be late.” Bending her
left hand, she laid it on his shoulder, and her little feet in their pink
slippers began swiftly, lightly, and rhythmically moving over the slippery
floor in time to the music.
“It’s a rest to waltz with you,” he said to her, as they fell
into the first slow steps of the waltz. “It’s exquisite—such
lightness, precision.” He said to her the same thing he said to almost
all his partners whom he knew well.
She smiled at his praise, and continued to look about the room over his
shoulder. She was not like a girl at her first ball, for whom all faces in the
ballroom melt into one vision of fairyland. And she was not a girl who had gone
the stale round of balls till every face in the ballroom was familiar and
tiresome. But she was in the middle stage between these two; she was excited,
and at the same time she had sufficient self-possession to be able to observe.
In the left corner of the ballroom she saw the cream of society gathered
together. There—incredibly naked—was the beauty Lidi,
Korsunsky’s wife; there was the lady of the house; there shone the bald
head of Krivin, always to be found where the best people were. In that
direction gazed the young men, not venturing to approach. There, too, she
descried Stiva, and there she saw the exquisite figure and head of Anna in a
black velvet gown. And he was there. Kitty had not seen him since the
evening she refused Levin. With her long-sighted eyes, she knew him at once,
and was even aware that he was looking at her.
“Another turn, eh? You’re not tired?” said Korsunsky, a
little out of breath.
“No, thank you!”
“Where shall I take you?”
“Madame Karenina’s here, I think ... take me to her.”
“Wherever you command.”
And Korsunsky began waltzing with measured steps straight towards the group in
the left corner, continually saying, “Pardon, mesdames, pardon, pardon,
mesdames”; and steering his course through the sea of lace, tulle, and
ribbon, and not disarranging a feather, he turned his partner sharply round, so
that her slim ankles, in light transparent stockings, were exposed to view, and
her train floated out in fan shape and covered Krivin’s knees. Korsunsky
bowed, set straight his open shirt front, and gave her his arm to conduct her
to Anna Arkadyevna. Kitty, flushed, took her train from Krivin’s knees,
and, a little giddy, looked round, seeking Anna. Anna was not in lilac, as
Kitty had so urgently wished, but in a black, low-cut, velvet gown, showing her
full throat and shoulders, that looked as though carved in old ivory, and her
rounded arms, with tiny, slender wrists. The whole gown was trimmed with
Venetian guipure. On her head, among her black hair—her own, with no
false additions—was a little wreath of pansies, and a bouquet of the same
in the black ribbon of her sash among white lace. Her coiffure was not
striking. All that was noticeable was the little wilful tendrils of her curly
hair that would always break free about her neck and temples. Round her
well-cut, strong neck was a thread of pearls.
Kitty had been seeing Anna every day; she adored her, and had pictured her
invariably in lilac. But now seeing her in black, she felt that she had not
fully seen her charm. She saw her now as someone quite new and surprising to
her. Now she understood that Anna could not have been in lilac, and that her
charm was just that she always stood out against her attire, that her dress
could never be noticeable on her. And her black dress, with its sumptuous lace,
was not noticeable on her; it was only the frame, and all that was seen was
she—simple, natural, elegant, and at the same time gay and eager.
She was standing holding herself, as always, very erect, and when Kitty drew
near the group she was speaking to the master of the house, her head slightly
turned towards him.
“No, I don’t throw stones,” she was saying, in answer to
something, “though I can’t understand it,” she went on,
shrugging her shoulders, and she turned at once with a soft smile of protection
towards Kitty. With a flying, feminine glance she scanned her attire, and made
a movement of her head, hardly perceptible, but understood by Kitty, signifying
approval of her dress and her looks. “You came into the room
dancing,” she added.
“This is one of my most faithful supporters,” said Korsunsky,
bowing to Anna Arkadyevna, whom he had not yet seen. “The princess helps
to make balls happy and successful. Anna Arkadyevna, a waltz?” he said,
bending down to her.
“Why, have you met?” inquired their host.
“Is there anyone we have not met? My wife and I are like white
wolves—everyone knows us,” answered Korsunsky. “A waltz, Anna
Arkadyevna?”
“I don’t dance when it’s possible not to dance,” she
said.
“But tonight it’s impossible,” answered Korsunsky.
At that instant Vronsky came up.
“Well, since it’s impossible tonight, let us start,” she
said, not noticing Vronsky’s bow, and she hastily put her hand on
Korsunsky’s shoulder.
“What is she vexed with him about?” thought Kitty, discerning that
Anna had intentionally not responded to Vronsky’s bow. Vronsky went up to
Kitty reminding her of the first quadrille, and expressing his regret that he
had not seen her all this time. Kitty gazed in admiration at Anna waltzing, and
listened to him. She expected him to ask her for a waltz, but he did not, and
she glanced wonderingly at him. He flushed slightly, and hurriedly asked her to
waltz, but he had only just put his arm round her waist and taken the first
step when the music suddenly stopped. Kitty looked into his face, which was so
close to her own, and long afterwards—for several years after—that
look, full of love, to which he made no response, cut her to the heart with an
agony of shame.
“Pardon! pardon! Waltz! waltz!” shouted Korsunsky from the
other side of the room, and seizing the first young lady he came across he
began dancing himself.
Vronsky and Kitty waltzed several times round the room. After the first waltz
Kitty went to her mother, and she had hardly time to say a few words to
Countess Nordston when Vronsky came up again for the first quadrille. During
the quadrille nothing of any significance was said: there was disjointed talk
between them of the Korsunskys, husband and wife, whom he described very
amusingly, as delightful children at forty, and of the future town theater; and
only once the conversation touched her to the quick, when he asked her about
Levin, whether he was here, and added that he liked him so much. But Kitty did
not expect much from the quadrille. She looked forward with a thrill at her
heart to the mazurka. She fancied that in the mazurka everything must be
decided. The fact that he did not during the quadrille ask her for the mazurka
did not trouble her. She felt sure she would dance the mazurka with him as she
had done at former balls, and refused five young men, saying she was engaged
for the mazurka. The whole ball up to the last quadrille was for Kitty an
enchanted vision of delightful colors, sounds, and motions. She only sat down
when she felt too tired and begged for a rest. But as she was dancing the last
quadrille with one of the tiresome young men whom she could not refuse, she
chanced to be vis-à-vis with Vronsky and Anna. She had not been near
Anna again since the beginning of the evening, and now again she saw her
suddenly quite new and surprising. She saw in her the signs of that excitement
of success she knew so well in herself; she saw that she was intoxicated with
the delighted admiration she was exciting. She knew that feeling and knew its
signs, and saw them in Anna; saw the quivering, flashing light in her eyes, and
the smile of happiness and excitement unconsciously playing on her lips, and
the deliberate grace, precision, and lightness of her movements.
“Who?” she asked herself. “All or one?” And not
assisting the harassed young man she was dancing with in the conversation, the
thread of which he had lost and could not pick up again, she obeyed with
external liveliness the peremptory shouts of Korsunsky starting them all into
the grand rond, and then into the chaîne, and at the same time
she kept watch with a growing pang at her heart. “No, it’s not the
admiration of the crowd has intoxicated her, but the adoration of one. And that
one? can it be he?” Every time he spoke to Anna the joyous light flashed
into her eyes, and the smile of happiness curved her red lips. She seemed to
make an effort to control herself, to try not to show these signs of delight,
but they came out on her face of themselves. “But what of him?”
Kitty looked at him and was filled with terror. What was pictured so clearly to
Kitty in the mirror of Anna’s face she saw in him. What had become of his
always self-possessed resolute manner, and the carelessly serene expression of
his face? Now every time he turned to her, he bent his head, as though he would
have fallen at her feet, and in his eyes there was nothing but humble
submission and dread. “I would not offend you,” his eyes seemed
every time to be saying, “but I want to save myself, and I don’t
know how.” On his face was a look such as Kitty had never seen before.
They were speaking of common acquaintances, keeping up the most trivial
conversation, but to Kitty it seemed that every word they said was determining
their fate and hers. And strange it was that they were actually talking of how
absurd Ivan Ivanovitch was with his French, and how the Eletsky girl might have
made a better match, yet these words had all the while consequence for them,
and they were feeling just as Kitty did. The whole ball, the whole world,
everything seemed lost in fog in Kitty’s soul. Nothing but the stern
discipline of her bringing-up supported her and forced her to do what was
expected of her, that is, to dance, to answer questions, to talk, even to
smile. But before the mazurka, when they were beginning to rearrange the chairs
and a few couples moved out of the smaller rooms into the big room, a moment of
despair and horror came for Kitty. She had refused five partners, and now she
was not dancing the mazurka. She had not even a hope of being asked for it,
because she was so successful in society that the idea would never occur to
anyone that she had remained disengaged till now. She would have to tell her
mother she felt ill and go home, but she had not the strength to do this. She
felt crushed. She went to the furthest end of the little drawing-room and sank
into a low chair. Her light, transparent skirts rose like a cloud about her
slender waist; one bare, thin, soft, girlish arm, hanging listlessly, was lost
in the folds of her pink tunic; in the other she held her fan, and with rapid,
short strokes fanned her burning face. But while she looked like a butterfly,
clinging to a blade of grass, and just about to open its rainbow wings for
fresh flight, her heart ached with a horrible despair.
“But perhaps I am wrong, perhaps it was not so?” And again she
recalled all she had seen.
“Kitty, what is it?” said Countess Nordston, stepping noiselessly
over the carpet towards her. “I don’t understand it.”
Kitty’s lower lip began to quiver; she got up quickly.
“Kitty, you’re not dancing the mazurka?”
“No, no,” said Kitty in a voice shaking with tears.
“He asked her for the mazurka before me,” said Countess Nordston,
knowing Kitty would understand who were “he” and “her.”
“She said: ‘Why, aren’t you going to dance it with Princess
Shtcherbatskaya?’”
“Oh, I don’t care!” answered Kitty.
No one but she herself understood her position; no one knew that she had just
refused the man whom perhaps she loved, and refused him because she had put her
faith in another.
Countess Nordston found Korsunsky, with whom she was to dance the mazurka, and
told him to ask Kitty.
Kitty danced in the first couple, and luckily for her she had not to talk,
because Korsunsky was all the time running about directing the figure. Vronsky
and Anna sat almost opposite her. She saw them with her long-sighted eyes, and
saw them, too, close by, when they met in the figures, and the more she saw of
them the more convinced was she that her unhappiness was complete. She saw that
they felt themselves alone in that crowded room. And on Vronsky’s face,
always so firm and independent, she saw that look that had struck her, of
bewilderment and humble submissiveness, like the expression of an intelligent
dog when it has done wrong.
Anna smiled, and her smile was reflected by him. She grew thoughtful, and he
became serious. Some supernatural force drew Kitty’s eyes to Anna’s
face. She was fascinating in her simple black dress, fascinating were her round
arms with their bracelets, fascinating was her firm neck with its thread of
pearls, fascinating the straying curls of her loose hair, fascinating the
graceful, light movements of her little feet and hands, fascinating was that
lovely face in its eagerness, but there was something terrible and cruel in her
fascination.
Kitty admired her more than ever, and more and more acute was her suffering.
Kitty felt overwhelmed, and her face showed it. When Vronsky saw her, coming
across her in the mazurka, he did not at once recognize her, she was so
changed.
“Delightful ball!” he said to her, for the sake of saying
something.
“Yes,” she answered.
In the middle of the mazurka, repeating a complicated figure, newly invented by
Korsunsky, Anna came forward into the center of the circle, chose two
gentlemen, and summoned a lady and Kitty. Kitty gazed at her in dismay as she
went up. Anna looked at her with drooping eyelids, and smiled, pressing her
hand. But, noticing that Kitty only responded to her smile by a look of despair
and amazement, she turned away from her, and began gaily talking to the other
lady.
“Yes, there is something uncanny, devilish and fascinating in her,”
Kitty said to herself.
Anna did not mean to stay to supper, but the master of the house began to press
her to do so.
“Nonsense, Anna Arkadyevna,” said Korsunsky, drawing her bare arm
under the sleeve of his dress coat, “I’ve such an idea for a
cotillion! Un bijou!”
And he moved gradually on, trying to draw her along with him. Their host smiled
approvingly.
“No, I am not going to stay,” answered Anna, smiling, but in spite
of her smile, both Korsunsky and the master of the house saw from her resolute
tone that she would not stay.
“No; why, as it is, I have danced more at your ball in Moscow than I have
all the winter in Petersburg,” said Anna, looking round at Vronsky, who
stood near her. “I must rest a little before my journey.”
“Are you certainly going tomorrow then?” asked Vronsky.
“Yes, I suppose so,” answered Anna, as it were wondering at the
boldness of his question; but the irrepressible, quivering brilliance of her
eyes and her smile set him on fire as she said it.
Anna Arkadyevna did not stay to supper, but went home.
“Yes, there is something in me hateful, repulsive,” thought Levin,
as he came away from the Shtcherbatskys’, and walked in the direction of
his brother’s lodgings. “And I don’t get on with other
people. Pride, they say. No, I have no pride. If I had any pride, I should not
have put myself in such a position.” And he pictured to himself Vronsky,
happy, good-natured, clever, and self-possessed, certainly never placed in the
awful position in which he had been that evening. “Yes, she was bound to
choose him. So it had to be, and I cannot complain of anyone or anything. I am
myself to blame. What right had I to imagine she would care to join her life to
mine? Who am I and what am I? A nobody, not wanted by anyone, nor of use to
anybody.” And he recalled his brother Nikolay, and dwelt with pleasure on
the thought of him. “Isn’t he right that everything in the world is
base and loathsome? And are we fair in our judgment of brother Nikolay? Of
course, from the point of view of Prokofy, seeing him in a torn cloak and
tipsy, he’s a despicable person. But I know him differently. I know his
soul, and know that we are like him. And I, instead of going to seek him out,
went out to dinner, and came here.” Levin walked up to a lamppost, read
his brother’s address, which was in his pocketbook, and called a sledge.
All the long way to his brother’s, Levin vividly recalled all the facts
familiar to him of his brother Nikolay’s life. He remembered how his
brother, while at the university, and for a year afterwards, had, in spite of
the jeers of his companions, lived like a monk, strictly observing all
religious rites, services, and fasts, and avoiding every sort of pleasure,
especially women. And afterwards, how he had all at once broken out: he had
associated with the most horrible people, and rushed into the most senseless
debauchery. He remembered later the scandal over a boy, whom he had taken from
the country to bring up, and, in a fit of rage, had so violently beaten that
proceedings were brought against him for unlawfully wounding. Then he recalled
the scandal with a sharper, to whom he had lost money, and given a promissory
note, and against whom he had himself lodged a complaint, asserting that he had
cheated him. (This was the money Sergey Ivanovitch had paid.) Then he
remembered how he had spent a night in the lockup for disorderly conduct in the
street. He remembered the shameful proceedings he had tried to get up against
his brother Sergey Ivanovitch, accusing him of not having paid him his share of
his mother’s fortune, and the last scandal, when he had gone to a western
province in an official capacity, and there had got into trouble for assaulting
a village elder.... It was all horribly disgusting, yet to Levin it appeared
not at all in the same disgusting light as it inevitably would to those who did
not know Nikolay, did not know all his story, did not know his heart.
Levin remembered that when Nikolay had been in the devout stage, the period of
fasts and monks and church services, when he was seeking in religion a support
and a curb for his passionate temperament, everyone, far from encouraging him,
had jeered at him, and he, too, with the others. They had teased him, called
him Noah, and monk; and, when he had broken out, no one had helped him, but
everyone had turned away from him with horror and disgust.
Levin felt that, in spite of all the ugliness of his life, his brother Nikolay,
in his soul, in the very depths of his soul, was no more in the wrong than the
people who despised him. He was not to blame for having been born with his
unbridled temperament and his somehow limited intelligence. But he had always
wanted to be good. “I will tell him everything, without reserve, and I
will make him speak without reserve, too, and I’ll show him that I love
him, and so understand him,” Levin resolved to himself, as, towards
eleven o’clock, he reached the hotel of which he had the address.
“At the top, 12 and 13,” the porter answered Levin’s inquiry.
“At home?”
“Sure to be at home.”
The door of No. 12 was half open, and there came out into the streak of light
thick fumes of cheap, poor tobacco, and the sound of a voice, unknown to Levin;
but he knew at once that his brother was there; he heard his cough.
As he went in the door, the unknown voice was saying:
“It all depends with how much judgment and knowledge the thing’s
done.”
Konstantin Levin looked in at the door, and saw that the speaker was a young
man with an immense shock of hair, wearing a Russian jerkin, and that a
pockmarked woman in a woolen gown, without collar or cuffs, was sitting on the
sofa. His brother was not to be seen. Konstantin felt a sharp pang at his heart
at the thought of the strange company in which his brother spent his life. No
one had heard him, and Konstantin, taking off his galoshes, listened to what
the gentleman in the jerkin was saying. He was speaking of some enterprise.
“Well, the devil flay them, the privileged classes,” his
brother’s voice responded, with a cough. “Masha! get us some supper
and some wine if there’s any left; or else go and get some.”
The woman rose, came out from behind the screen, and saw Konstantin.
“There’s some gentleman, Nikolay Dmitrievitch,” she said.
“Whom do you want?” said the voice of Nikolay Levin, angrily.
“It’s I,” answered Konstantin Levin, coming forward into the
light.
“Who’s I?” Nikolay’s voice said again, still
more angrily. He could be heard getting up hurriedly, stumbling against
something, and Levin saw, facing him in the doorway, the big, scared eyes, and
the huge, thin, stooping figure of his brother, so familiar, and yet
astonishing in its weirdness and sickliness.
He was even thinner than three years before, when Konstantin Levin had seen him
last. He was wearing a short coat, and his hands and big bones seemed huger
than ever. His hair had grown thinner, the same straight mustaches hid his
lips, the same eyes gazed strangely and naïvely at his visitor.
“Ah, Kostya!” he exclaimed suddenly, recognizing his brother, and
his eyes lit up with joy. But the same second he looked round at the young man,
and gave the nervous jerk of his head and neck that Konstantin knew so well, as
if his neckband hurt him; and a quite different expression, wild, suffering,
and cruel, rested on his emaciated face.
“I wrote to you and Sergey Ivanovitch both that I don’t know you
and don’t want to know you. What is it you want?”
He was not at all the same as Konstantin had been fancying him. The worst and
most tiresome part of his character, what made all relations with him so
difficult, had been forgotten by Konstantin Levin when he thought of him, and
now, when he saw his face, and especially that nervous twitching of his head,
he remembered it all.
“I didn’t want to see you for anything,” he answered timidly.
“I’ve simply come to see you.”
His brother’s timidity obviously softened Nikolay. His lips twitched.
“Oh, so that’s it?” he said. “Well, come in; sit down.
Like some supper? Masha, bring supper for three. No, stop a minute. Do you know
who this is?” he said, addressing his brother, and indicating the
gentleman in the jerkin: “This is Mr. Kritsky, my friend from Kiev, a
very remarkable man. He’s persecuted by the police, of course, because
he’s not a scoundrel.”
And he looked round in the way he always did at everyone in the room. Seeing
that the woman standing in the doorway was moving to go, he shouted to her,
“Wait a minute, I said.” And with the inability to express himself,
the incoherence that Konstantin knew so well, he began, with another look round
at everyone, to tell his brother Kritsky’s story: how he had been
expelled from the university for starting a benefit society for the poor
students and Sunday schools; and how he had afterwards been a teacher in a
peasant school, and how he had been driven out of that too, and had afterwards
been condemned for something.
“You’re of the Kiev university?” said Konstantin Levin to
Kritsky, to break the awkward silence that followed.
“Yes, I was of Kiev,” Kritsky replied angrily, his face darkening.
“And this woman,” Nikolay Levin interrupted him, pointing to her,
“is the partner of my life, Marya Nikolaevna. I took her out of a bad
house,” and he jerked his neck saying this; “but I love her and
respect her, and anyone who wants to know me,” he added, raising his
voice and knitting his brows, “I beg to love her and respect her.
She’s just the same as my wife, just the same. So now you know whom
you’ve to do with. And if you think you’re lowering yourself, well,
here’s the floor, there’s the door.”
And again his eyes traveled inquiringly over all of them.
“Why I should be lowering myself, I don’t understand.”
“Then, Masha, tell them to bring supper; three portions, spirits and
wine.... No, wait a minute.... No, it doesn’t matter.... Go along.”
“So you see,” pursued Nikolay Levin, painfully wrinkling his
forehead and twitching.
It was obviously difficult for him to think of what to say and do.
“Here, do you see?”... He pointed to some sort of iron bars,
fastened together with strings, lying in a corner of the room. “Do you
see that? That’s the beginning of a new thing we’re going into.
It’s a productive association....”
Konstantin scarcely heard him. He looked into his sickly, consumptive face, and
he was more and more sorry for him, and he could not force himself to listen to
what his brother was telling him about the association. He saw that this
association was a mere anchor to save him from self-contempt. Nikolay Levin
went on talking:
“You know that capital oppresses the laborer. The laborers with us, the
peasants, bear all the burden of labor, and are so placed that however much
they work they can’t escape from their position of beasts of burden. All
the profits of labor, on which they might improve their position, and gain
leisure for themselves, and after that education, all the surplus values are
taken from them by the capitalists. And society’s so constituted that the
harder they work, the greater the profit of the merchants and landowners, while
they stay beasts of burden to the end. And that state of things must be
changed,” he finished up, and he looked questioningly at his brother.
“Yes, of course,” said Konstantin, looking at the patch of red that
had come out on his brother’s projecting cheekbones.
“And so we’re founding a locksmiths’ association, where all
the production and profit and the chief instruments of production will be in
common.”
“Where is the association to be?” asked Konstantin Levin.
“In the village of Vozdrem, Kazan government.”
“But why in a village? In the villages, I think, there is plenty of work
as it is. Why a locksmiths’ association in a village?”
“Why? Because the peasants are just as much slaves as they ever were, and
that’s why you and Sergey Ivanovitch don’t like people to try and
get them out of their slavery,” said Nikolay Levin, exasperated by the
objection.
Konstantin Levin sighed, looking meanwhile about the cheerless and dirty room.
This sigh seemed to exasperate Nikolay still more.
“I know your and Sergey Ivanovitch’s aristocratic views. I know
that he applies all the power of his intellect to justify existing
evils.”
“No; and what do you talk of Sergey Ivanovitch for?” said Levin,
smiling.
“Sergey Ivanovitch? I’ll tell you what for!” Nikolay Levin
shrieked suddenly at the name of Sergey Ivanovitch. “I’ll tell you
what for.... But what’s the use of talking? There’s only one
thing.... What did you come to me for? You look down on this, and you’re
welcome to,—and go away, in God’s name go away!” he shrieked,
getting up from his chair. “And go away, and go away!”
“I don’t look down on it at all,” said Konstantin Levin
timidly. “I don’t even dispute it.”
At that instant Marya Nikolaevna came back. Nikolay Levin looked round angrily
at her. She went quickly to him, and whispered something.
“I’m not well; I’ve grown irritable,” said Nikolay
Levin, getting calmer and breathing painfully; “and then you talk to me
of Sergey Ivanovitch and his article. It’s such rubbish, such lying, such
self-deception. What can a man write of justice who knows nothing of it? Have
you read his article?” he asked Kritsky, sitting down again at the table,
and moving back off half of it the scattered cigarettes, so as to clear a
space.
“I’ve not read it,” Kritsky responded gloomily, obviously not
desiring to enter into the conversation.
“Why not?” said Nikolay Levin, now turning with exasperation upon
Kritsky.
“Because I didn’t see the use of wasting my time over it.”
“Oh, but excuse me, how did you know it would be wasting your time? That
article’s too deep for many people—that’s to say it’s
over their heads. But with me, it’s another thing; I see through his
ideas, and I know where its weakness lies.”
Everyone was mute. Kritsky got up deliberately and reached his cap.
“Won’t you have supper? All right, good-bye! Come round tomorrow
with the locksmith.”
Kritsky had hardly gone out when Nikolay Levin smiled and winked.
“He’s no good either,” he said. “I see, of
course....”
But at that instant Kritsky, at the door, called him....
“What do you want now?” he said, and went out to him in the
passage. Left alone with Marya Nikolaevna, Levin turned to her.
“Have you been long with my brother?” he said to her.
“Yes, more than a year. Nikolay Dmitrievitch’s health has become
very poor. Nikolay Dmitrievitch drinks a great deal,” she said.
“That is ... how does he drink?”
“Drinks vodka, and it’s bad for him.”
“And a great deal?” whispered Levin.
“Yes,” she said, looking timidly towards the doorway, where Nikolay
Levin had reappeared.
“What were you talking about?” he said, knitting his brows, and
turning his scared eyes from one to the other. “What was it?”
“Oh, nothing,” Konstantin answered in confusion.
“Oh, if you don’t want to say, don’t. Only it’s no good
your talking to her. She’s a wench, and you’re a gentleman,”
he said with a jerk of the neck. “You understand everything, I see, and
have taken stock of everything, and look with commiseration on my
shortcomings,” he began again, raising his voice.
“Nikolay Dmitrievitch, Nikolay Dmitrievitch,” whispered Marya
Nikolaevna, again going up to him.
“Oh, very well, very well!... But where’s the supper? Ah, here it
is,” he said, seeing a waiter with a tray. “Here, set it
here,” he added angrily, and promptly seizing the vodka, he poured out a
glassful and drank it greedily. “Like a drink?” he turned to his
brother, and at once became better humored.
“Well, enough of Sergey Ivanovitch. I’m glad to see you, anyway.
After all’s said and done, we’re not strangers. Come, have a drink.
Tell me what you’re doing,” he went on, greedily munching a piece
of bread, and pouring out another glassful. “How are you living?”
“I live alone in the country, as I used to. I’m busy looking after
the land,” answered Konstantin, watching with horror the greediness with
which his brother ate and drank, and trying to conceal that he noticed it.
“Why don’t you get married?”
“It hasn’t happened so,” Konstantin answered, reddening a
little.
“Why not? For me now ... everything’s at an end! I’ve made a
mess of my life. But this I’ve said, and I say still, that if my share
had been given me when I needed it, my whole life would have been
different.”
Konstantin made haste to change the conversation.
“Do you know your little Vanya’s with me, a clerk in the
countinghouse at Pokrovskoe.”
Nikolay jerked his neck, and sank into thought.
“Yes, tell me what’s going on at Pokrovskoe. Is the house standing
still, and the birch trees, and our schoolroom? And Philip the gardener, is he
living? How I remember the arbor and the seat! Now mind and don’t alter
anything in the house, but make haste and get married, and make everything as
it used to be again. Then I’ll come and see you, if your wife is
nice.”
“But come to me now,” said Levin. “How nicely we would
arrange it!”
“I’d come and see you if I were sure I should not find Sergey
Ivanovitch.”
“You wouldn’t find him there. I live quite independently of
him.”
“Yes, but say what you like, you will have to choose between me and
him,” he said, looking timidly into his brother’s face.
This timidity touched Konstantin.
“If you want to hear my confession of faith on the subject, I tell you
that in your quarrel with Sergey Ivanovitch I take neither side. You’re
both wrong. You’re more wrong externally, and he inwardly.”
“Ah, ah! You see that, you see that!” Nikolay shouted joyfully.
“But I personally value friendly relations with you more
because....”
“Why, why?”
Konstantin could not say that he valued it more because Nikolay was unhappy,
and needed affection. But Nikolay knew that this was just what he meant to say,
and scowling he took up the vodka again.
“Enough, Nikolay Dmitrievitch!” said Marya Nikolaevna, stretching
out her plump, bare arm towards the decanter.
“Let it be! Don’t insist! I’ll beat you!” he shouted.
Marya Nikolaevna smiled a sweet and good-humored smile, which was at once
reflected on Nikolay’s face, and she took the bottle.
“And do you suppose she understands nothing?” said Nikolay.
“She understands it all better than any of us. Isn’t it true
there’s something good and sweet in her?”
“Were you never before in Moscow?” Konstantin said to her, for the
sake of saying something.
“Only you mustn’t be polite and stiff with her. It frightens her.
No one ever spoke to her so but the justices of the peace who tried her for
trying to get out of a house of ill-fame. Mercy on us, the senselessness in the
world!” he cried suddenly. “These new institutions, these justices
of the peace, rural councils, what hideousness it all is!”
And he began to enlarge on his encounters with the new institutions.
Konstantin Levin heard him, and the disbelief in the sense of all public
institutions, which he shared with him, and often expressed, was distasteful to
him now from his brother’s lips.
“In another world we shall understand it all,” he said lightly.
“In another world! Ah, I don’t like that other world! I don’t
like it,” he said, letting his scared eyes rest on his brother’s
eyes. “Here one would think that to get out of all the baseness and the
mess, one’s own and other people’s, would be a good thing, and yet
I’m afraid of death, awfully afraid of death.” He shuddered.
“But do drink something. Would you like some champagne? Or shall we go
somewhere? Let’s go to the Gypsies! Do you know I have got so fond of the
Gypsies and Russian songs.”
His speech had begun to falter, and he passed abruptly from one subject to
another. Konstantin with the help of Masha persuaded him not to go out
anywhere, and got him to bed hopelessly drunk.
Masha promised to write to Konstantin in case of need, and to persuade Nikolay
Levin to go and stay with his brother.
In the morning Konstantin Levin left Moscow, and towards evening he reached
home. On the journey in the train he talked to his neighbors about politics and
the new railways, and, just as in Moscow, he was overcome by a sense of
confusion of ideas, dissatisfaction with himself, shame of something or other.
But when he got out at his own station, when he saw his one-eyed coachman,
Ignat, with the collar of his coat turned up; when, in the dim light reflected
by the station fires, he saw his own sledge, his own horses with their tails
tied up, in their harness trimmed with rings and tassels; when the coachman
Ignat, as he put in his luggage, told him the village news, that the contractor
had arrived, and that Pava had calved,—he felt that little by little the
confusion was clearing up, and the shame and self-dissatisfaction were passing
away. He felt this at the mere sight of Ignat and the horses; but when he had
put on the sheepskin brought for him, had sat down wrapped up in the sledge,
and had driven off pondering on the work that lay before him in the village,
and staring at the side-horse, that had been his saddle-horse, past his prime
now, but a spirited beast from the Don, he began to see what had happened to
him in quite a different light. He felt himself, and did not want to be anyone
else. All he wanted now was to be better than before. In the first place he
resolved that from that day he would give up hoping for any extraordinary
happiness, such as marriage must have given him, and consequently he would not
so disdain what he really had. Secondly, he would never again let himself give
way to low passion, the memory of which had so tortured him when he had been
making up his mind to make an offer. Then remembering his brother Nikolay, he
resolved to himself that he would never allow himself to forget him, that he
would follow him up, and not lose sight of him, so as to be ready to help when
things should go ill with him. And that would be soon, he felt. Then, too, his
brother’s talk of communism, which he had treated so lightly at the time,
now made him think. He considered a revolution in economic conditions nonsense.
But he always felt the injustice of his own abundance in comparison with the
poverty of the peasants, and now he determined that so as to feel quite in the
right, though he had worked hard and lived by no means luxuriously before, he
would now work still harder, and would allow himself even less luxury. And all
this seemed to him so easy a conquest over himself that he spent the whole
drive in the pleasantest daydreams. With a resolute feeling of hope in a new,
better life, he reached home before nine o’clock at night.
The snow of the little quadrangle before the house was lit up by a light in the
bedroom windows of his old nurse, Agafea Mihalovna, who performed the duties of
housekeeper in his house. She was not yet asleep. Kouzma, waked up by her, came
sidling sleepily out onto the steps. A setter bitch, Laska, ran out too, almost
upsetting Kouzma, and whining, turned round about Levin’s knees, jumping
up and longing, but not daring, to put her forepaws on his chest.
“You’re soon back again, sir,” said Agafea Mihalovna.
“I got tired of it, Agafea Mihalovna. With friends, one is well; but at
home, one is better,” he answered, and went into his study.
The study was slowly lit up as the candle was brought in. The familiar details
came out: the stag’s horns, the bookshelves, the looking-glass, the stove
with its ventilator, which had long wanted mending, his father’s sofa, a
large table, on the table an open book, a broken ashtray, a manuscript book
with his handwriting. As he saw all this, there came over him for an instant a
doubt of the possibility of arranging the new life, of which he had been
dreaming on the road. All these traces of his life seemed to clutch him, and to
say to him: “No, you’re not going to get away from us, and
you’re not going to be different, but you’re going to be the same
as you’ve always been; with doubts, everlasting dissatisfaction with
yourself, vain efforts to amend, and falls, and everlasting expectation, of a
happiness which you won’t get, and which isn’t possible for
you.”
This the things said to him, but another voice in his heart was telling him
that he must not fall under the sway of the past, and that one can do anything
with oneself. And hearing that voice, he went into the corner where stood his
two heavy dumbbells, and began brandishing them like a gymnast, trying to
restore his confident temper. There was a creak of steps at the door. He
hastily put down the dumbbells.
The bailiff came in, and said everything, thank God, was doing well; but
informed him that the buckwheat in the new drying machine had been a little
scorched. This piece of news irritated Levin. The new drying machine had been
constructed and partly invented by Levin. The bailiff had always been against
the drying machine, and now it was with suppressed triumph that he announced
that the buckwheat had been scorched. Levin was firmly convinced that if the
buckwheat had been scorched, it was only because the precautions had not been
taken, for which he had hundreds of times given orders. He was annoyed, and
reprimanded the bailiff. But there had been an important and joyful event:
Pava, his best cow, an expensive beast, bought at a show, had calved.
“Kouzma, give me my sheepskin. And you tell them to take a lantern.
I’ll come and look at her,” he said to the bailiff.
The cowhouse for the more valuable cows was just behind the house. Walking
across the yard, passing a snowdrift by the lilac tree, he went into the
cowhouse. There was the warm, steamy smell of dung when the frozen door was
opened, and the cows, astonished at the unfamiliar light of the lantern,
stirred on the fresh straw. He caught a glimpse of the broad, smooth, black and
piebald back of Hollandka. Berkoot, the bull, was lying down with his ring in
his lip, and seemed about to get up, but thought better of it, and only gave
two snorts as they passed by him. Pava, a perfect beauty, huge as a
hippopotamus, with her back turned to them, prevented their seeing the calf, as
she sniffed her all over.
Levin went into the pen, looked Pava over, and lifted the red and spotted calf
onto her long, tottering legs. Pava, uneasy, began lowing, but when Levin put
the calf close to her she was soothed, and, sighing heavily, began licking her
with her rough tongue. The calf, fumbling, poked her nose under her
mother’s udder, and stiffened her tail out straight.
“Here, bring the light, Fyodor, this way,” said Levin, examining
the calf. “Like the mother! though the color takes after the father; but
that’s nothing. Very good. Long and broad in the haunch. Vassily
Fedorovitch, isn’t she splendid?” he said to the bailiff, quite
forgiving him for the buckwheat under the influence of his delight in the calf.
“How could she fail to be? Oh, Semyon the contractor came the day after
you left. You must settle with him, Konstantin Dmitrievitch,” said the
bailiff. “I did inform you about the machine.”
This question was enough to take Levin back to all the details of his work on
the estate, which was on a large scale, and complicated. He went straight from
the cowhouse to the counting house, and after a little conversation with the
bailiff and Semyon the contractor, he went back to the house and straight
upstairs to the drawing-room.
The house was big and old-fashioned, and Levin, though he lived alone, had the
whole house heated and used. He knew that this was stupid, he knew that it was
positively not right, and contrary to his present new plans, but this house was
a whole world to Levin. It was the world in which his father and mother had
lived and died. They had lived just the life that to Levin seemed the ideal of
perfection, and that he had dreamed of beginning with his wife, his family.
Levin scarcely remembered his mother. His conception of her was for him a
sacred memory, and his future wife was bound to be in his imagination a
repetition of that exquisite, holy ideal of a woman that his mother had been.
He was so far from conceiving of love for woman apart from marriage that he
positively pictured to himself first the family, and only secondarily the woman
who would give him a family. His ideas of marriage were, consequently, quite
unlike those of the great majority of his acquaintances, for whom getting
married was one of the numerous facts of social life. For Levin it was the
chief affair of life, on which its whole happiness turned. And now he had to
give up that.
When he had gone into the little drawing-room, where he always had tea, and had
settled himself in his armchair with a book, and Agafea Mihalovna had brought
him tea, and with her usual, “Well, I’ll stay a while, sir,”
had taken a chair in the window, he felt that, however strange it might be, he
had not parted from his daydreams, and that he could not live without them.
Whether with her, or with another, still it would be. He was reading a book,
and thinking of what he was reading, and stopping to listen to Agafea
Mihalovna, who gossiped away without flagging, and yet with all that, all sorts
of pictures of family life and work in the future rose disconnectedly before
his imagination. He felt that in the depth of his soul something had been put
in its place, settled down, and laid to rest.
He heard Agafea Mihalovna talking of how Prohor had forgotten his duty to God,
and with the money Levin had given him to buy a horse, had been drinking
without stopping, and had beaten his wife till he’d half killed her. He
listened, and read his book, and recalled the whole train of ideas suggested by
his reading. It was Tyndall’s Treatise on Heat. He recalled his
own criticisms of Tyndall of his complacent satisfaction in the cleverness of
his experiments, and for his lack of philosophic insight. And suddenly there
floated into his mind the joyful thought: “In two years’ time I
shall have two Dutch cows; Pava herself will perhaps still be alive, a dozen
young daughters of Berkoot and the three others—how lovely!”
He took up his book again. “Very good, electricity and heat are the same
thing; but is it possible to substitute the one quantity for the other in the
equation for the solution of any problem? No. Well, then what of it? The
connection between all the forces of nature is felt instinctively....
It’s particulary nice if Pava’s daughter should be a red-spotted
cow, and all the herd will take after her, and the other three, too! Splendid!
To go out with my wife and visitors to meet the herd.... My wife says,
‘Kostya and I looked after that calf like a child.’ ‘How can
it interest you so much?’ says a visitor. ‘Everything that
interests him, interests me.’ But who will she be?” And he
remembered what had happened at Moscow.... “Well, there’s nothing
to be done.... It’s not my fault. But now everything shall go on in a new
way. It’s nonsense to pretend that life won’t let one, that the
past won’t let one. One must struggle to live better, much
better.”... He raised his head, and fell to dreaming. Old Laska, who had
not yet fully digested her delight at his return, and had run out into the yard
to bark, came back wagging her tail, and crept up to him, bringing in the scent
of fresh air, put her head under his hand, and whined plaintively, asking to be
stroked.
“There, who’d have thought it?” said Agafea Mihalovna.
“The dog now ... why, she understands that her master’s come home,
and that he’s low-spirited.”
“Why low-spirited?”
“Do you suppose I don’t see it, sir? It’s high time I should
know the gentry. Why, I’ve grown up from a little thing with them.
It’s nothing, sir, so long as there’s health and a clear
conscience.”
Levin looked intently at her, surprised at how well she knew his thought.
“Shall I fetch you another cup?” said she, and taking his cup she
went out.
Laska kept poking her head under his hand. He stroked her, and she promptly
curled up at his feet, laying her head on a hindpaw. And in token of all now
being well and satisfactory, she opened her mouth a little, smacked her lips,
and settling her sticky lips more comfortably about her old teeth, she sank
into blissful repose. Levin watched all her movements attentively.
“That’s what I’ll do,” he said to himself;
“that’s what I’ll do! Nothing’s amiss.... All’s
well.”
After the ball, early next morning, Anna Arkadyevna sent her husband a telegram
that she was leaving Moscow the same day.
“No, I must go, I must go”; she explained to her sister-in-law the
change in her plans in a tone that suggested that she had to remember so many
things that there was no enumerating them: “no, it had really better be
today!”
Stepan Arkadyevitch was not dining at home, but he promised to come and see his
sister off at seven o’clock.
Kitty, too, did not come, sending a note that she had a headache. Dolly and
Anna dined alone with the children and the English governess. Whether it was
that the children were fickle, or that they had acute senses, and felt that
Anna was quite different that day from what she had been when they had taken
such a fancy to her, that she was not now interested in them,—but they
had abruptly dropped their play with their aunt, and their love for her, and
were quite indifferent that she was going away. Anna was absorbed the whole
morning in preparations for her departure. She wrote notes to her Moscow
acquaintances, put down her accounts, and packed. Altogether Dolly fancied she
was not in a placid state of mind, but in that worried mood, which Dolly knew
well with herself, and which does not come without cause, and for the most part
covers dissatisfaction with self. After dinner, Anna went up to her room to
dress, and Dolly followed her.
“How queer you are today!” Dolly said to her.
“I? Do you think so? I’m not queer, but I’m nasty. I am like
that sometimes. I keep feeling as if I could cry. It’s very stupid, but
it’ll pass off,” said Anna quickly, and she bent her flushed face
over a tiny bag in which she was packing a nightcap and some cambric
handkerchiefs. Her eyes were particularly bright, and were continually swimming
with tears. “In the same way I didn’t want to leave Petersburg, and
now I don’t want to go away from here.”
“You came here and did a good deed,” said Dolly, looking intently
at her.
Anna looked at her with eyes wet with tears.
“Don’t say that, Dolly. I’ve done nothing, and could do
nothing. I often wonder why people are all in league to spoil me. What have I
done, and what could I do? In your heart there was found love enough to
forgive....”
“If it had not been for you, God knows what would have happened! How
happy you are, Anna!” said Dolly. “Everything is clear and good in
your heart.”
“Every heart has its own skeletons, as the English say.”
“You have no sort of skeleton, have you? Everything is so clear in
you.”
“I have!” said Anna suddenly, and, unexpectedly after her tears, a
sly, ironical smile curved her lips.
“Come, he’s amusing, anyway, your skeleton, and not
depressing,” said Dolly, smiling.
“No, he’s depressing. Do you know why I’m going today instead
of tomorrow? It’s a confession that weighs on me; I want to make it to
you,” said Anna, letting herself drop definitely into an armchair, and
looking straight into Dolly’s face.
And to her surprise Dolly saw that Anna was blushing up to her ears, up to the
curly black ringlets on her neck.
“Yes,” Anna went on. “Do you know why Kitty didn’t come
to dinner? She’s jealous of me. I have spoiled ... I’ve been the
cause of that ball being a torture to her instead of a pleasure. But truly,
truly, it’s not my fault, or only my fault a little bit,” she said,
daintily drawling the words “a little bit.”
“Oh, how like Stiva you said that!” said Dolly, laughing.
Anna was hurt.
“Oh no, oh no! I’m not Stiva,” she said, knitting her brows.
“That’s why I’m telling you, just because I could never let
myself doubt myself for an instant,” said Anna.
But at the very moment she was uttering the words, she felt that they were not
true. She was not merely doubting herself, she felt emotion at the thought of
Vronsky, and was going away sooner than she had meant, simply to avoid meeting
him.
“Yes, Stiva told me you danced the mazurka with him, and that
he....”
“You can’t imagine how absurdly it all came about. I only meant to
be matchmaking, and all at once it turned out quite differently. Possibly
against my own will....”
She crimsoned and stopped.
“Oh, they feel it directly?” said Dolly.
“But I should be in despair if there were anything serious in it on his
side,” Anna interrupted her. “And I am certain it will all be
forgotten, and Kitty will leave off hating me.”
“All the same, Anna, to tell you the truth, I’m not very anxious
for this marriage for Kitty. And it’s better it should come to nothing,
if he, Vronsky, is capable of falling in love with you in a single day.”
“Oh, heavens, that would be too silly!” said Anna, and again a deep
flush of pleasure came out on her face, when she heard the idea, that absorbed
her, put into words. “And so here I am going away, having made an enemy
of Kitty, whom I liked so much! Ah, how sweet she is! But you’ll make it
right, Dolly? Eh?”
Dolly could scarcely suppress a smile. She loved Anna, but she enjoyed seeing
that she too had her weaknesses.
“An enemy? That can’t be.”
“I did so want you all to care for me, as I do for you, and now I care
for you more than ever,” said Anna, with tears in her eyes. “Ah,
how silly I am today!”
She passed her handkerchief over her face and began dressing.
At the very moment of starting Stepan Arkadyevitch arrived, late, rosy and
good-humored, smelling of wine and cigars.
Anna’s emotionalism infected Dolly, and when she embraced her
sister-in-law for the last time, she whispered: “Remember, Anna, what
you’ve done for me—I shall never forget. And remember that I love
you, and shall always love you as my dearest friend!”
“I don’t know why,” said Anna, kissing her and hiding her
tears.
“You understood me, and you understand. Good-bye, my darling!”
“Come, it’s all over, and thank God!” was the first thought
that came to Anna Arkadyevna, when she had said good-bye for the last time to
her brother, who had stood blocking up the entrance to the carriage till the
third bell rang. She sat down on her lounge beside Annushka, and looked about
her in the twilight of the sleeping-carriage. “Thank God! tomorrow I
shall see Seryozha and Alexey Alexandrovitch, and my life will go on in the old
way, all nice and as usual.”
Still in the same anxious frame of mind, as she had been all that day, Anna
took pleasure in arranging herself for the journey with great care. With her
little deft hands she opened and shut her little red bag, took out a cushion,
laid it on her knees, and carefully wrapping up her feet, settled herself
comfortably. An invalid lady had already lain down to sleep. Two other ladies
began talking to Anna, and a stout elderly lady tucked up her feet, and made
observations about the heating of the train. Anna answered a few words, but not
foreseeing any entertainment from the conversation, she asked Annushka to get a
lamp, hooked it onto the arm of her seat, and took from her bag a paper-knife
and an English novel. At first her reading made no progress. The fuss and
bustle were disturbing; then when the train had started, she could not help
listening to the noises; then the snow beating on the left window and sticking
to the pane, and the sight of the muffled guard passing by, covered with snow
on one side, and the conversations about the terrible snowstorm raging outside,
distracted her attention. Farther on, it was continually the same again and
again: the same shaking and rattling, the same snow on the window, the same
rapid transitions from steaming heat to cold, and back again to heat, the same
passing glimpses of the same figures in the twilight, and the same voices, and
Anna began to read and to understand what she read. Annushka was already
dozing, the red bag on her lap, clutched by her broad hands, in gloves, of
which one was torn. Anna Arkadyevna read and understood, but it was distasteful
to her to read, that is, to follow the reflection of other people’s
lives. She had too great a desire to live herself. If she read that the heroine
of the novel was nursing a sick man, she longed to move with noiseless steps
about the room of a sick man; if she read of a member of Parliament making a
speech, she longed to be delivering the speech; if she read of how Lady Mary
had ridden after the hounds, and had provoked her sister-in-law, and had
surprised everyone by her boldness, she too wished to be doing the same. But
there was no chance of doing anything; and twisting the smooth paper-knife in
her little hands, she forced herself to read.
The hero of the novel was already almost reaching his English happiness, a
baronetcy and an estate, and Anna was feeling a desire to go with him to the
estate, when she suddenly felt that he ought to feel ashamed, and that
she was ashamed of the same thing. But what had he to be ashamed of?
“What have I to be ashamed of?” she asked herself in injured
surprise. She laid down the book and sank against the back of the chair,
tightly gripping the paper-cutter in both hands. There was nothing. She went
over all her Moscow recollections. All were good, pleasant. She remembered the
ball, remembered Vronsky and his face of slavish adoration, remembered all her
conduct with him: there was nothing shameful. And for all that, at the same
point in her memories, the feeling of shame was intensified, as though some
inner voice, just at the point when she thought of Vronsky, were saying to her,
“Warm, very warm, hot.” “Well, what is it?” she said to
herself resolutely, shifting her seat in the lounge. “What does it mean?
Am I afraid to look it straight in the face? Why, what is it? Can it be that
between me and this officer boy there exist, or can exist, any other relations
than such as are common with every acquaintance?” She laughed
contemptuously and took up her book again; but now she was definitely unable to
follow what she read. She passed the paper-knife over the window pane, then
laid its smooth, cool surface to her cheek, and almost laughed aloud at the
feeling of delight that all at once without cause came over her. She felt as
though her nerves were strings being strained tighter and tighter on some sort
of screwing peg. She felt her eyes opening wider and wider, her fingers and
toes twitching nervously, something within oppressing her breathing, while all
shapes and sounds seemed in the uncertain half-light to strike her with
unaccustomed vividness. Moments of doubt were continually coming upon her, when
she was uncertain whether the train were going forwards or backwards, or were
standing still altogether; whether it were Annushka at her side or a stranger.
“What’s that on the arm of the chair, a fur cloak or some beast?
And what am I myself? Myself or some other woman?” She was afraid of
giving way to this delirium. But something drew her towards it, and she could
yield to it or resist it at will. She got up to rouse herself, and slipped off
her plaid and the cape of her warm dress. For a moment she regained her
self-possession, and realized that the thin peasant who had come in wearing a
long overcoat, with buttons missing from it, was the stoveheater, that he was
looking at the thermometer, that it was the wind and snow bursting in after him
at the door; but then everything grew blurred again.... That peasant with the
long waist seemed to be gnawing something on the wall, the old lady began
stretching her legs the whole length of the carriage, and filling it with a
black cloud; then there was a fearful shrieking and banging, as though someone
were being torn to pieces; then there was a blinding dazzle of red fire before
her eyes and a wall seemed to rise up and hide everything. Anna felt as though
she were sinking down. But it was not terrible, but delightful. The voice of a
man muffled up and covered with snow shouted something in her ear. She got up
and pulled herself together; she realized that they had reached a station and
that this was the guard. She asked Annushka to hand her the cape she had taken
off and her shawl, put them on and moved towards the door.
“Do you wish to get out?” asked Annushka.
“Yes, I want a little air. It’s very hot in here.” And she
opened the door. The driving snow and the wind rushed to meet her and struggled
with her over the door. But she enjoyed the struggle.
She opened the door and went out. The wind seemed as though lying in wait for
her; with gleeful whistle it tried to snatch her up and bear her off, but she
clung to the cold door post, and holding her skirt got down onto the platform
and under the shelter of the carriages. The wind had been powerful on the
steps, but on the platform, under the lee of the carriages, there was a lull.
With enjoyment she drew deep breaths of the frozen, snowy air, and standing
near the carriage looked about the platform and the lighted station.
The raging tempest rushed whistling between the wheels of the carriages, about
the scaffolding, and round the corner of the station. The carriages, posts,
people, everything that was to be seen was covered with snow on one side, and
was getting more and more thickly covered. For a moment there would come a lull
in the storm, but then it would swoop down again with such onslaughts that it
seemed impossible to stand against it. Meanwhile men ran to and fro, talking
merrily together, their steps crackling on the platform as they continually
opened and closed the big doors. The bent shadow of a man glided by at her
feet, and she heard sounds of a hammer upon iron. “Hand over that
telegram!” came an angry voice out of the stormy darkness on the other
side. “This way! No. 28!” several different voices shouted again,
and muffled figures ran by covered with snow. Two gentlemen with lighted
cigarettes passed by her. She drew one more deep breath of the fresh air, and
had just put her hand out of her muff to take hold of the door post and get
back into the carriage, when another man in a military overcoat, quite close
beside her, stepped between her and the flickering light of the lamp post. She
looked round, and the same instant recognized Vronsky’s face. Putting his
hand to the peak of his cap, he bowed to her and asked, Was there anything she
wanted? Could he be of any service to her? She gazed rather a long while at him
without answering, and, in spite of the shadow in which he was standing, she
saw, or fancied she saw, both the expression of his face and his eyes. It was
again that expression of reverential ecstasy which had so worked upon her the
day before. More than once she had told herself during the past few days, and
again only a few moments before, that Vronsky was for her only one of the
hundreds of young men, forever exactly the same, that are met everywhere, that
she would never allow herself to bestow a thought upon him. But now at the
first instant of meeting him, she was seized by a feeling of joyful pride. She
had no need to ask why he had come. She knew as certainly as if he had told her
that he was here to be where she was.
“I didn’t know you were going. What are you coming for?” she
said, letting fall the hand with which she had grasped the door post. And
irrepressible delight and eagerness shone in her face.
“What am I coming for?” he repeated, looking straight into her
eyes. “You know that I have come to be where you are,” he said;
“I can’t help it.”
At that moment the wind, as it were, surmounting all obstacles, sent the snow
flying from the carriage roofs, and clanked some sheet of iron it had torn off,
while the hoarse whistle of the engine roared in front, plaintively and
gloomily. All the awfulness of the storm seemed to her more splendid now. He
had said what her soul longed to hear, though she feared it with her reason.
She made no answer, and in her face he saw conflict.
“Forgive me, if you dislike what I said,” he said humbly.
He had spoken courteously, deferentially, yet so firmly, so stubbornly, that
for a long while she could make no answer.
“It’s wrong, what you say, and I beg you, if you’re a good
man, to forget what you’ve said, as I forget it,” she said at last.
“Not one word, not one gesture of yours shall I, could I, ever
forget....”
“Enough, enough!” she cried trying assiduously to give a stern
expression to her face, into which he was gazing greedily. And clutching at the
cold door post, she clambered up the steps and got rapidly into the corridor of
the carriage. But in the little corridor she paused, going over in her
imagination what had happened. Though she could not recall her own words or
his, she realized instinctively that the momentary conversation had brought
them fearfully closer; and she was panic-stricken and blissful at it. After
standing still a few seconds, she went into the carriage and sat down in her
place. The overstrained condition which had tormented her before did not only
come back, but was intensified, and reached such a pitch that she was afraid
every minute that something would snap within her from the excessive tension.
She did not sleep all night. But in that nervous tension, and in the visions
that filled her imagination, there was nothing disagreeable or gloomy: on the
contrary there was something blissful, glowing, and exhilarating. Towards
morning Anna sank into a doze, sitting in her place, and when she waked it was
daylight and the train was near Petersburg. At once thoughts of home, of
husband and of son, and the details of that day and the following came upon
her.
At Petersburg, as soon as the train stopped and she got out, the first person
that attracted her attention was her husband. “Oh, mercy! why do his ears
look like that?” she thought, looking at his frigid and imposing figure,
and especially the ears that struck her at the moment as propping up the brim
of his round hat. Catching sight of her, he came to meet her, his lips falling
into their habitual sarcastic smile, and his big, tired eyes looking straight
at her. An unpleasant sensation gripped at her heart when she met his obstinate
and weary glance, as though she had expected to see him different. She was
especially struck by the feeling of dissatisfaction with herself that she
experienced on meeting him. That feeling was an intimate, familiar feeling,
like a consciousness of hypocrisy, which she experienced in her relations with
her husband. But hitherto she had not taken note of the feeling, now she was
clearly and painfully aware of it.
“Yes, as you see, your tender spouse, as devoted as the first year after
marriage, burned with impatience to see you,” he said in his deliberate,
high-pitched voice, and in that tone which he almost always took with her, a
tone of jeering at anyone who should say in earnest what he said.
“Is Seryozha quite well?” she asked.
“And is this all the reward,” said he, “for my ardor?
He’s quite well....”
Vronsky had not even tried to sleep all that night. He sat in his armchair,
looking straight before him or scanning the people who got in and out. If he
had indeed on previous occasions struck and impressed people who did not know
him by his air of unhesitating composure, he seemed now more haughty and
self-possessed than ever. He looked at people as if they were things. A nervous
young man, a clerk in a law court, sitting opposite him, hated him for that
look. The young man asked him for a light, and entered into conversation with
him, and even pushed against him, to make him feel that he was not a thing, but
a person. But Vronsky gazed at him exactly as he did at the lamp, and the young
man made a wry face, feeling that he was losing his self-possession under the
oppression of this refusal to recognize him as a person.
Vronsky saw nothing and no one. He felt himself a king, not because he believed
that he had made an impression on Anna—he did not yet believe
that,—but because the impression she had made on him gave him happiness
and pride.
What would come of it all he did not know, he did not even think. He felt that
all his forces, hitherto dissipated, wasted, were centered on one thing, and
bent with fearful energy on one blissful goal. And he was happy at it. He knew
only that he had told her the truth, that he had come where she was, that all
the happiness of his life, the only meaning in life for him, now lay in seeing
and hearing her. And when he got out of the carriage at Bologova to get some
seltzer water, and caught sight of Anna, involuntarily his first word had told
her just what he thought. And he was glad he had told her it, that she knew it
now and was thinking of it. He did not sleep all night. When he was back in the
carriage, he kept unceasingly going over every position in which he had seen
her, every word she had uttered, and before his fancy, making his heart faint
with emotion, floated pictures of a possible future.
When he got out of the train at Petersburg, he felt after his sleepless night
as keen and fresh as after a cold bath. He paused near his compartment, waiting
for her to get out. “Once more,” he said to himself, smiling
unconsciously, “once more I shall see her walk, her face; she will say
something, turn her head, glance, smile, maybe.” But before he caught
sight of her, he saw her husband, whom the station-master was deferentially
escorting through the crowd. “Ah, yes! The husband.” Only now for
the first time did Vronsky realize clearly the fact that there was a person
attached to her, a husband. He knew that she had a husband, but had hardly
believed in his existence, and only now fully believed in him, with his head
and shoulders, and his legs clad in black trousers; especially when he saw this
husband calmly take her arm with a sense of property.
Seeing Alexey Alexandrovitch with his Petersburg face and severely
self-confident figure, in his round hat, with his rather prominent spine, he
believed in him, and was aware of a disagreeable sensation, such as a man might
feel tortured by thirst, who, on reaching a spring, should find a dog, a sheep,
or a pig, who has drunk of it and muddied the water. Alexey
Alexandrovitch’s manner of walking, with a swing of the hips and flat
feet, particularly annoyed Vronsky. He could recognize in no one but himself an
indubitable right to love her. But she was still the same, and the sight of her
affected him the same way, physically reviving him, stirring him, and filling
his soul with rapture. He told his German valet, who ran up to him from the
second class, to take his things and go on, and he himself went up to her. He
saw the first meeting between the husband and wife, and noted with a
lover’s insight the signs of slight reserve with which she spoke to her
husband. “No, she does not love him and cannot love him,” he
decided to himself.
At the moment when he was approaching Anna Arkadyevna he noticed too with joy
that she was conscious of his being near, and looked round, and seeing him,
turned again to her husband.
“Have you passed a good night?” he asked, bowing to her and her
husband together, and leaving it up to Alexey Alexandrovitch to accept the bow
on his own account, and to recognize it or not, as he might see fit.
“Thank you, very good,” she answered.
Her face looked weary, and there was not that play of eagerness in it, peeping
out in her smile and her eyes; but for a single instant, as she glanced at him,
there was a flash of something in her eyes, and although the flash died away at
once, he was happy for that moment. She glanced at her husband to find out
whether he knew Vronsky. Alexey Alexandrovitch looked at Vronsky with
displeasure, vaguely recalling who this was. Vronsky’s composure and
self-confidence here struck, like a scythe against a stone, upon the cold
self-confidence of Alexey Alexandrovitch.
“Count Vronsky,” said Anna.
“Ah! We are acquainted, I believe,” said Alexey Alexandrovitch
indifferently, giving his hand.
“You set off with the mother and you return with the son,” he said,
articulating each syllable, as though each were a separate favor he was
bestowing.
“You’re back from leave, I suppose?” he said, and without
waiting for a reply, he turned to his wife in his jesting tone: “Well,
were a great many tears shed at Moscow at parting?”
By addressing his wife like this he gave Vronsky to understand that he wished
to be left alone, and, turning slightly towards him, he touched his hat; but
Vronsky turned to Anna Arkadyevna.
“I hope I may have the honor of calling on you,” he said.
Alexey Alexandrovitch glanced with his weary eyes at Vronsky.
“Delighted,” he said coldly. “On Mondays we’re at home.
Most fortunate,” he said to his wife, dismissing Vronsky altogether,
“that I should just have half an hour to meet you, so that I can prove my
devotion,” he went on in the same jesting tone.
“You lay too much stress on your devotion for me to value it much,”
she responded in the same jesting tone, involuntarily listening to the sound of
Vronsky’s steps behind them. “But what has it to do with me?”
she said to herself, and she began asking her husband how Seryozha had got on
without her.
“Oh, capitally! Mariette says he has been very good, And ... I must
disappoint you ... but he has not missed you as your husband has. But once more
merci, my dear, for giving me a day. Our dear Samovar will be
delighted.” (He used to call the Countess Lidia Ivanovna, well known in
society, a samovar, because she was always bubbling over with excitement.)
“She has been continually asking after you. And, do you know, if I may
venture to advise you, you should go and see her today. You know how she takes
everything to heart. Just now, with all her own cares, she’s anxious
about the Oblonskys being brought together.”
The Countess Lidia Ivanovna was a friend of her husband’s, and the center
of that one of the coteries of the Petersburg world with which Anna was,
through her husband, in the closest relations.
“But you know I wrote to her?”
“Still she’ll want to hear details. Go and see her, if you’re
not too tired, my dear. Well, Kondraty will take you in the carriage, while I
go to my committee. I shall not be alone at dinner again,” Alexey
Alexandrovitch went on, no longer in a sarcastic tone. “You
wouldn’t believe how I’ve missed....” And with a long pressure
of her hand and a meaning smile, he put her in her carriage.
The first person to meet Anna at home was her son. He dashed down the stairs to
her, in spite of the governess’s call, and with desperate joy shrieked:
“Mother! mother!” Running up to her, he hung on her neck.
“I told you it was mother!” he shouted to the governess. “I
knew!”
And her son, like her husband, aroused in Anna a feeling akin to
disappointment. She had imagined him better than he was in reality. She had to
let herself drop down to the reality to enjoy him as he really was. But even as
he was, he was charming, with his fair curls, his blue eyes, and his plump,
graceful little legs in tightly pulled-up stockings. Anna experienced almost
physical pleasure in the sensation of his nearness, and his caresses, and moral
soothing, when she met his simple, confiding, and loving glance, and heard his
naïve questions. Anna took out the presents Dolly’s children had sent
him, and told her son what sort of little girl was Tanya at Moscow, and how
Tanya could read, and even taught the other children.
“Why, am I not so nice as she?” asked Seryozha.
“To me you’re nicer than anyone in the world.”
“I know that,” said Seryozha, smiling.
Anna had not had time to drink her coffee when the Countess Lidia Ivanovna was
announced. The Countess Lidia Ivanovna was a tall, stout woman, with an
unhealthily sallow face and splendid, pensive black eyes. Anna liked her, but
today she seemed to be seeing her for the first time with all her defects.
“Well, my dear, so you took the olive branch?” inquired Countess
Lidia Ivanovna, as soon as she came into the room.
“Yes, it’s all over, but it was all much less serious than we had
supposed,” answered Anna. “My belle-sœur is in general too
hasty.”
But Countess Lidia Ivanovna, though she was interested in everything that did
not concern her, had a habit of never listening to what interested her; she
interrupted Anna:
“Yes, there’s plenty of sorrow and evil in the world. I am so
worried today.”
“Oh, why?” asked Anna, trying to suppress a smile.
“I’m beginning to be weary of fruitlessly championing the truth,
and sometimes I’m quite unhinged by it. The Society of the Little
Sisters” (this was a religiously-patriotic, philanthropic institution)
“was going splendidly, but with these gentlemen it’s impossible to
do anything,” added Countess Lidia Ivanovna in a tone of ironical
submission to destiny. “They pounce on the idea, and distort it, and then
work it out so pettily and unworthily. Two or three people, your husband among
them, understand all the importance of the thing, but the others simply drag it
down. Yesterday Pravdin wrote to me....”
Pravdin was a well-known Panslavist abroad, and Countess Lidia Ivanovna
described the purport of his letter.
Then the countess told her of more disagreements and intrigues against the work
of the unification of the churches, and departed in haste, as she had that day
to be at the meeting of some society and also at the Slavonic committee.
“It was all the same before, of course; but why was it I didn’t
notice it before?” Anna asked herself. “Or has she been very much
irritated today? It’s really ludicrous; her object is doing good; she a
Christian, yet she’s always angry; and she always has enemies, and always
enemies in the name of Christianity and doing good.”
After Countess Lidia Ivanovna another friend came, the wife of a chief
secretary, who told her all the news of the town. At three o’clock she
too went away, promising to come to dinner. Alexey Alexandrovitch was at the
ministry. Anna, left alone, spent the time till dinner in assisting at her
son’s dinner (he dined apart from his parents) and in putting her things
in order, and in reading and answering the notes and letters which had
accumulated on her table.
The feeling of causeless shame, which she had felt on the journey, and her
excitement, too, had completely vanished. In the habitual conditions of her
life she felt again resolute and irreproachable.
She recalled with wonder her state of mind on the previous day. “What was
it? Nothing. Vronsky said something silly, which it was easy to put a stop to,
and I answered as I ought to have done. To speak of it to my husband would be
unnecessary and out of the question. To speak of it would be to attach
importance to what has no importance.” She remembered how she had told
her husband of what was almost a declaration made her at Petersburg by a young
man, one of her husband’s subordinates, and how Alexey Alexandrovitch had
answered that every woman living in the world was exposed to such incidents,
but that he had the fullest confidence in her tact, and could never lower her
and himself by jealousy. “So then there’s no reason to speak of it?
And indeed, thank God, there’s nothing to speak of,” she told
herself.
Alexey Alexandrovitch came back from the meeting of the ministers at four
o’clock, but as often happened, he had not time to come in to her. He
went into his study to see the people waiting for him with petitions, and to
sign some papers brought him by his chief secretary. At dinner time (there were
always a few people dining with the Karenins) there arrived an old lady, a
cousin of Alexey Alexandrovitch, the chief secretary of the department and his
wife, and a young man who had been recommended to Alexey Alexandrovitch for the
service. Anna went into the drawing-room to receive these guests. Precisely at
five o’clock, before the bronze Peter the First clock had struck the
fifth stroke, Alexey Alexandrovitch came in, wearing a white tie and evening
coat with two stars, as he had to go out directly after dinner. Every minute of
Alexey Alexandrovitch’s life was portioned out and occupied. And to make
time to get through all that lay before him every day, he adhered to the
strictest punctuality. “Unhasting and unresting,” was his motto. He
came into the dining hall, greeted everyone, and hurriedly sat down, smiling to
his wife.
“Yes, my solitude is over. You wouldn’t believe how
uncomfortable” (he laid stress on the word uncomfortable)
“it is to dine alone.”
At dinner he talked a little to his wife about Moscow matters, and, with a
sarcastic smile, asked her after Stepan Arkadyevitch; but the conversation was
for the most part general, dealing with Petersburg official and public news.
After dinner he spent half an hour with his guests, and again, with a smile,
pressed his wife’s hand, withdrew, and drove off to the council. Anna did
not go out that evening either to the Princess Betsy Tverskaya, who, hearing of
her return, had invited her, nor to the theater, where she had a box for that
evening. She did not go out principally because the dress she had reckoned upon
was not ready. Altogether, Anna, on turning, after the departure of her guests,
to the consideration of her attire, was very much annoyed. She was generally a
mistress of the art of dressing well without great expense, and before leaving
Moscow she had given her dressmaker three dresses to transform. The dresses had
to be altered so that they could not be recognized, and they ought to have been
ready three days before. It appeared that two dresses had not been done at all,
while the other one had not been altered as Anna had intended. The dressmaker
came to explain, declaring that it would be better as she had done it, and Anna
was so furious that she felt ashamed when she thought of it afterwards. To
regain her serenity completely she went into the nursery, and spent the whole
evening with her son, put him to bed herself, signed him with the cross, and
tucked him up. She was glad she had not gone out anywhere, and had spent the
evening so well. She felt so light-hearted and serene, she saw so clearly that
all that had seemed to her so important on her railway journey was only one of
the common trivial incidents of fashionable life, and that she had no reason to
feel ashamed before anyone else or before herself. Anna sat down at the hearth
with an English novel and waited for her husband. Exactly at half-past nine she
heard his ring, and he came into the room.
“Here you are at last!” she observed, holding out her hand to him.
He kissed her hand and sat down beside her.
“Altogether then, I see your visit was a success,” he said to her.
“Oh, yes,” she said, and she began telling him about everything
from the beginning: her journey with Countess Vronskaya, her arrival, the
accident at the station. Then she described the pity she had felt, first for
her brother, and afterwards for Dolly.
“I imagine one cannot exonerate such a man from blame, though he is your
brother,” said Alexey Alexandrovitch severely.
Anna smiled. She knew that he said that simply to show that family
considerations could not prevent him from expressing his genuine opinion. She
knew that characteristic in her husband, and liked it.
“I am glad it has all ended so satisfactorily, and that you are back
again,” he went on. “Come, what do they say about the new act I
have got passed in the council?”
Anna had heard nothing of this act, and she felt conscience-stricken at having
been able so readily to forget what was to him of such importance.
“Here, on the other hand, it has made a great sensation,” he said,
with a complacent smile.
She saw that Alexey Alexandrovitch wanted to tell her something pleasant to him
about it, and she brought him by questions to telling it. With the same
complacent smile he told her of the ovations he had received in consequence of
the act he had passed.
“I was very, very glad. It shows that at last a reasonable and steady
view of the matter is becoming prevalent among us.”
Having drunk his second cup of tea with cream, and bread, Alexey Alexandrovitch
got up, and was going towards his study.
“And you’ve not been anywhere this evening? You’ve been dull,
I expect?” he said.
“Oh, no!” she answered, getting up after him and accompanying him
across the room to his study. “What are you reading now?” she
asked.
“Just now I’m reading Duc de Lille, Poésie des
Enfers,” he answered. “A very remarkable book.”
Anna smiled, as people smile at the weaknesses of those they love, and, putting
her hand under his, she escorted him to the door of the study. She knew his
habit, that had grown into a necessity, of reading in the evening. She knew,
too, that in spite of his official duties, which swallowed up almost the whole
of his time, he considered it his duty to keep up with everything of note that
appeared in the intellectual world. She knew, too, that he was really
interested in books dealing with politics, philosophy, and theology, that art
was utterly foreign to his nature; but, in spite of this, or rather, in
consequence of it, Alexey Alexandrovitch never passed over anything in the
world of art, but made it his duty to read everything. She knew that in
politics, in philosophy, in theology, Alexey Alexandrovitch often had doubts,
and made investigations; but on questions of art and poetry, and, above all, of
music, of which he was totally devoid of understanding, he had the most
distinct and decided opinions. He was fond of talking about Shakespeare,
Raphael, Beethoven, of the significance of new schools of poetry and music, all
of which were classified by him with very conspicuous consistency.
“Well, God be with you,” she said at the door of the study, where a
shaded candle and a decanter of water were already put by his armchair.
“And I’ll write to Moscow.”
He pressed her hand, and again kissed it.
“All the same he’s a good man; truthful, good-hearted, and
remarkable in his own line,” Anna said to herself going back to her room,
as though she were defending him to someone who had attacked him and said that
one could not love him. “But why is it his ears stick out so strangely?
Or has he had his hair cut?”
Precisely at twelve o’clock, when Anna was still sitting at her
writing-table, finishing a letter to Dolly, she heard the sound of measured
steps in slippers, and Alexey Alexandrovitch, freshly washed and combed, with a
book under his arm, came in to her.
“It’s time, it’s time,” said he, with a meaning smile,
and he went into their bedroom.
“And what right had he to look at him like that?” thought Anna,
recalling Vronsky’s glance at Alexey Alexandrovitch.
Undressing, she went into the bedroom; but her face had none of the eagerness
which, during her stay in Moscow, had fairly flashed from her eyes and her
smile; on the contrary, now the fire seemed quenched in her, hidden somewhere
far away.
When Vronsky went to Moscow from Petersburg, he had left his large set of rooms
in Morskaia to his friend and favorite comrade Petritsky.
Petritsky was a young lieutenant, not particularly well-connected, and not
merely not wealthy, but always hopelessly in debt. Towards evening he was
always drunk, and he had often been locked up after all sorts of ludicrous and
disgraceful scandals, but he was a favorite both of his comrades and his
superior officers. On arriving at twelve o’clock from the station at his
flat, Vronsky saw, at the outer door, a hired carriage familiar to him. While
still outside his own door, as he rang, he heard masculine laughter, the lisp
of a feminine voice, and Petritsky’s voice. “If that’s one of
the villains, don’t let him in!” Vronsky told the servant not to
announce him, and slipped quietly into the first room. Baroness Shilton, a
friend of Petritsky’s, with a rosy little face and flaxen hair,
resplendent in a lilac satin gown, and filling the whole room, like a canary,
with her Parisian chatter, sat at the round table making coffee. Petritsky, in
his overcoat, and the cavalry captain Kamerovsky, in full uniform, probably
just come from duty, were sitting each side of her.
“Bravo! Vronsky!” shouted Petritsky, jumping up, scraping his
chair. “Our host himself! Baroness, some coffee for him out of the new
coffee pot. Why, we didn’t expect you! Hope you’re satisfied with
the ornament of your study,” he said, indicating the baroness. “You
know each other, of course?”
“I should think so,” said Vronsky, with a bright smile, pressing
the baroness’s little hand. “What next! I’m an old
friend.”
“You’re home after a journey,” said the baroness, “so
I’m flying. Oh, I’ll be off this minute, if I’m in the
way.”
“You’re home, wherever you are, baroness,” said Vronsky.
“How do you do, Kamerovsky?” he added, coldly shaking hands with
Kamerovsky.
“There, you never know how to say such pretty things,” said the
baroness, turning to Petritsky.
“No; what’s that for? After dinner I say things quite as
good.”
“After dinner there’s no credit in them? Well, then, I’ll
make you some coffee, so go and wash and get ready,” said the baroness,
sitting down again, and anxiously turning the screw in the new coffee pot.
“Pierre, give me the coffee,” she said, addressing Petritsky, whom
she called Pierre as a contraction of his surname, making no secret of her
relations with him. “I’ll put it in.”
“You’ll spoil it!”
“No, I won’t spoil it! Well, and your wife?” said the
baroness suddenly, interrupting Vronsky’s conversation with his comrade.
“We’ve been marrying you here. Have you brought your wife?”
“No, baroness. I was born a Bohemian, and a Bohemian I shall die.”
“So much the better, so much the better. Shake hands on it.”
And the baroness, detaining Vronsky, began telling him, with many jokes, about
her last new plans of life, asking his advice.
“He persists in refusing to give me a divorce! Well, what am I to
do?” (He was her husband.) “Now I want to begin a suit
against him. What do you advise? Kamerovsky, look after the coffee; it’s
boiling over. You see, I’m engrossed with business! I want a lawsuit,
because I must have my property. Do you understand the folly of it, that on the
pretext of my being unfaithful to him,” she said contemptuously,
“he wants to get the benefit of my fortune.”
Vronsky heard with pleasure this light-hearted prattle of a pretty woman,
agreed with her, gave her half-joking counsel, and altogether dropped at once
into the tone habitual to him in talking to such women. In his Petersburg world
all people were divided into utterly opposed classes. One, the lower class,
vulgar, stupid, and, above all, ridiculous people, who believe that one husband
ought to live with the one wife whom he has lawfully married; that a girl
should be innocent, a woman modest, and a man manly, self-controlled, and
strong; that one ought to bring up one’s children, earn one’s
bread, and pay one’s debts; and various similar absurdities. This was the
class of old-fashioned and ridiculous people. But there was another class of
people, the real people. To this class they all belonged, and in it the great
thing was to be elegant, generous, plucky, gay, to abandon oneself without a
blush to every passion, and to laugh at everything else.
For the first moment only, Vronsky was startled after the impression of a quite
different world that he had brought with him from Moscow. But immediately as
though slipping his feet into old slippers, he dropped back into the
light-hearted, pleasant world he had always lived in.
The coffee was never really made, but spluttered over everyone, and boiled
away, doing just what was required of it—that is, providing much cause
for much noise and laughter, and spoiling a costly rug and the baroness’s
gown.
“Well now, good-bye, or you’ll never get washed, and I shall have
on my conscience the worst sin a gentleman can commit. So you would advise a
knife to his throat?”
“To be sure, and manage that your hand may not be far from his lips.
He’ll kiss your hand, and all will end satisfactorily,” answered
Vronsky.
“So at the Français!” and, with a rustle of her skirts, she
vanished.
Kamerovsky got up too, and Vronsky, not waiting for him to go, shook hands and
went off to his dressing-room.
While he was washing, Petritsky described to him in brief outlines his
position, as far as it had changed since Vronsky had left Petersburg. No money
at all. His father said he wouldn’t give him any and pay his debts. His
tailor was trying to get him locked up, and another fellow, too, was
threatening to get him locked up. The colonel of the regiment had announced
that if these scandals did not cease he would have to leave. As for the
baroness, he was sick to death of her, especially since she’d taken to
offering continually to lend him money. But he had found a
girl—he’d show her to Vronsky—a marvel, exquisite, in the
strict Oriental style, “genre of the slave Rebecca, don’t you
know.” He’d had a row, too, with Berkoshov, and was going to send
seconds to him, but of course it would come to nothing. Altogether everything
was supremely amusing and jolly. And, not letting his comrade enter into
further details of his position, Petritsky proceeded to tell him all the
interesting news. As he listened to Petritsky’s familiar stories in the
familiar setting of the rooms he had spent the last three years in, Vronsky
felt a delightful sense of coming back to the careless Petersburg life that he
was used to.
“Impossible!” he cried, letting down the pedal of the washing basin
in which he had been sousing his healthy red neck. “Impossible!” he
cried, at the news that Laura had flung over Fertinghof and had made up to
Mileev. “And is he as stupid and pleased as ever? Well, and how’s
Buzulukov?”
“Oh, there is a tale about Buzulukov—simply lovely!” cried
Petritsky. “You know his weakness for balls, and he never misses a single
court ball. He went to a big ball in a new helmet. Have you seen the new
helmets? Very nice, lighter. Well, so he’s standing.... No, I say, do
listen.”
“I am listening,” answered Vronsky, rubbing himself with a rough
towel.
“Up comes the Grand Duchess with some ambassador or other, and, as
ill-luck would have it, she begins talking to him about the new helmets. The
Grand Duchess positively wanted to show the new helmet to the ambassador. They
see our friend standing there.” (Petritsky mimicked how he was standing
with the helmet.) “The Grand Duchess asked him to give her the helmet; he
doesn’t give it to her. What do you think of that? Well, everyone’s
winking at him, nodding, frowning—give it to her, do! He doesn’t
give it to her. He’s mute as a fish. Only picture it!... Well, the ...
what’s his name, whatever he was ... tries to take the helmet from him
... he won’t give it up!... He pulls it from him, and hands it to the
Grand Duchess. ‘Here, your Highness,’ says he, ‘is the new
helmet.’ She turned the helmet the other side up, And—just picture
it!—plop went a pear and sweetmeats out of it, two pounds of
sweetmeats!... He’d been storing them up, the darling!”
Vronsky burst into roars of laughter. And long afterwards, when he was talking
of other things, he broke out into his healthy laugh, showing his strong, close
rows of teeth, when he thought of the helmet.
Having heard all the news, Vronsky, with the assistance of his valet, got into
his uniform, and went off to report himself. He intended, when he had done
that, to drive to his brother’s and to Betsy’s and to pay several
visits with a view to beginning to go into that society where he might meet
Madame Karenina. As he always did in Petersburg, he left home not meaning to
return till late at night.
At the end of the winter, in the Shtcherbatskys’ house, a consultation
was being held, which was to pronounce on the state of Kitty’s health and
the measures to be taken to restore her failing strength. She had been ill, and
as spring came on she grew worse. The family doctor gave her cod liver oil,
then iron, then nitrate of silver, but as the first and the second and the
third were alike in doing no good, and as his advice when spring came was to go
abroad, a celebrated physician was called in. The celebrated physician, a very
handsome man, still youngish, asked to examine the patient. He maintained, with
peculiar satisfaction, it seemed, that maiden modesty is a mere relic of
barbarism, and that nothing could be more natural than for a man still youngish
to handle a young girl naked. He thought it natural because he did it every
day, and felt and thought, as it seemed to him, no harm as he did it and
consequently he considered modesty in the girl not merely as a relic of
barbarism, but also as an insult to himself.
There was nothing for it but to submit, since, although all the doctors had
studied in the same school, had read the same books, and learned the same
science, and though some people said this celebrated doctor was a bad doctor,
in the princess’s household and circle it was for some reason accepted
that this celebrated doctor alone had some special knowledge, and that he alone
could save Kitty. After a careful examination and sounding of the bewildered
patient, dazed with shame, the celebrated doctor, having scrupulously washed
his hands, was standing in the drawing-room talking to the prince. The prince
frowned and coughed, listening to the doctor. As a man who had seen something
of life, and neither a fool nor an invalid, he had no faith in medicine, and in
his heart was furious at the whole farce, specially as he was perhaps the only
one who fully comprehended the cause of Kitty’s illness. “Conceited
blockhead!” he thought, as he listened to the celebrated doctor’s
chatter about his daughter’s symptoms. The doctor was meantime with
difficulty restraining the expression of his contempt for this old gentleman,
and with difficulty condescending to the level of his intelligence. He
perceived that it was no good talking to the old man, and that the principal
person in the house was the mother. Before her he decided to scatter his
pearls. At that instant the princess came into the drawing-room with the family
doctor. The prince withdrew, trying not to show how ridiculous he thought the
whole performance. The princess was distracted, and did not know what to do.
She felt she had sinned against Kitty.
“Well, doctor, decide our fate,” said the princess. “Tell me
everything.”
“Is there hope?” she meant to say, but her lips quivered, and she
could not utter the question. “Well, doctor?”
“Immediately, princess. I will talk it over with my colleague, and then I
will have the honor of laying my opinion before you.”
“So we had better leave you?”
“As you please.”
The princess went out with a sigh.
When the doctors were left alone, the family doctor began timidly explaining
his opinion, that there was a commencement of tuberculous trouble, but ... and
so on. The celebrated doctor listened to him, and in the middle of his sentence
looked at his big gold watch.
“Yes,” said he. “But....”
The family doctor respectfully ceased in the middle of his observations.
“The commencement of the tuberculous process we are not, as you are
aware, able to define; till there are cavities, there is nothing definite. But
we may suspect it. And there are indications; malnutrition, nervous
excitability, and so on. The question stands thus: in presence of indications
of tuberculous process, what is to be done to maintain nutrition?”
“But, you know, there are always moral, spiritual causes at the back in
these cases,” the family doctor permitted himself to interpolate with a
subtle smile.
“Yes, that’s an understood thing,” responded the celebrated
physician, again glancing at his watch. “Beg pardon, is the Yausky bridge
done yet, or shall I have to drive around?” he asked. “Ah! it is.
Oh, well, then I can do it in twenty minutes. So we were saying the problem may
be put thus: to maintain nutrition and to give tone to the nerves. The one is
in close connection with the other, one must attack both sides at once.”
“And how about a tour abroad?” asked the family doctor.
“I’ve no liking for foreign tours. And take note: if there is an
early stage of tuberculous process, of which we cannot be certain, a foreign
tour will be of no use. What is wanted is means of improving nutrition, and not
for lowering it.” And the celebrated doctor expounded his plan of
treatment with Soden waters, a remedy obviously prescribed primarily on the
ground that they could do no harm.
The family doctor listened attentively and respectfully.
“But in favor of foreign travel I would urge the change of habits, the
removal from conditions calling up reminiscences. And then the mother wishes
it,” he added.
“Ah! Well, in that case, to be sure, let them go. Only, those German
quacks are mischievous.... They ought to be persuaded.... Well, let them go
then.”
He glanced once more at his watch.
“Oh! time’s up already,” And he went to the door. The
celebrated doctor announced to the princess (a feeling of what was due from him
dictated his doing so) that he ought to see the patient once more.
“What! another examination!” cried the mother, with horror.
“Oh, no, only a few details, princess.”
“Come this way.”
And the mother, accompanied by the doctor, went into the drawing-room to Kitty.
Wasted and flushed, with a peculiar glitter in her eyes, left there by the
agony of shame she had been put through, Kitty stood in the middle of the room.
When the doctor came in she flushed crimson, and her eyes filled with tears.
All her illness and treatment struck her as a thing so stupid, ludicrous even!
Doctoring her seemed to her as absurd as putting together the pieces of a
broken vase. Her heart was broken. Why would they try to cure her with pills
and powders? But she could not grieve her mother, especially as her mother
considered herself to blame.
“May I trouble you to sit down, princess?” the celebrated doctor
said to her.
He sat down with a smile, facing her, felt her pulse, and again began asking
her tiresome questions. She answered him, and all at once got up, furious.
“Excuse me, doctor, but there is really no object in this. This is the
third time you’ve asked me the same thing.”
The celebrated doctor did not take offense.
“Nervous irritability,” he said to the princess, when Kitty had
left the room. “However, I had finished....”
And the doctor began scientifically explaining to the princess, as an
exceptionally intelligent woman, the condition of the young princess, and
concluded by insisting on the drinking of the waters, which were certainly
harmless. At the question: Should they go abroad? the doctor plunged into deep
meditation, as though resolving a weighty problem. Finally his decision was
pronounced: they were to go abroad, but to put no faith in foreign quacks, and
to apply to him in any need.
It seemed as though some piece of good fortune had come to pass after the
doctor had gone. The mother was much more cheerful when she went back to her
daughter, and Kitty pretended to be more cheerful. She had often, almost
always, to be pretending now.
“Really, I’m quite well, mamma. But if you want to go abroad,
let’s go!” she said, and trying to appear interested in the
proposed tour, she began talking of the preparations for the journey.
Soon after the doctor, Dolly had arrived. She knew that there was to be a
consultation that day, and though she was only just up after her confinement
(she had another baby, a little girl, born at the end of the winter), though
she had trouble and anxiety enough of her own, she had left her tiny baby and a
sick child, to come and hear Kitty’s fate, which was to be decided that
day.
“Well, well?” she said, coming into the drawing-room, without
taking off her hat. “You’re all in good spirits. Good news,
then?”
They tried to tell her what the doctor had said, but it appeared that though
the doctor had talked distinctly enough and at great length, it was utterly
impossible to report what he had said. The only point of interest was that it
was settled they should go abroad.
Dolly could not help sighing. Her dearest friend, her sister, was going away.
And her life was not a cheerful one. Her relations with Stepan Arkadyevitch
after their reconciliation had become humiliating. The union Anna had cemented
turned out to be of no solid character, and family harmony was breaking down
again at the same point. There had been nothing definite, but Stepan
Arkadyevitch was hardly ever at home; money, too, was hardly ever forthcoming,
and Dolly was continually tortured by suspicions of infidelity, which she tried
to dismiss, dreading the agonies of jealousy she had been through already. The
first onslaught of jealousy, once lived through, could never come back again,
and even the discovery of infidelities could never now affect her as it had the
first time. Such a discovery now would only mean breaking up family habits, and
she let herself be deceived, despising him and still more herself, for the
weakness. Besides this, the care of her large family was a constant worry to
her: first, the nursing of her young baby did not go well, then the nurse had
gone away, now one of the children had fallen ill.
“Well, how are all of you?” asked her mother.
“Ah, mamma, we have plenty of troubles of our own. Lili is ill, and
I’m afraid it’s scarlatina. I have come here now to hear about
Kitty, and then I shall shut myself up entirely, if—God forbid—it
should be scarlatina.”
The old prince too had come in from his study after the doctor’s
departure, and after presenting his cheek to Dolly, and saying a few words to
her, he turned to his wife:
“How have you settled it? you’re going? Well, and what do you mean
to do with me?”
“I suppose you had better stay here, Alexander,” said his wife.
“That’s as you like.”
“Mamma, why shouldn’t father come with us?” said Kitty.
“It would be nicer for him and for us too.”
The old prince got up and stroked Kitty’s hair. She lifted her head and
looked at him with a forced smile. It always seemed to her that he understood
her better than anyone in the family, though he did not say much about her.
Being the youngest, she was her father’s favorite, and she fancied that
his love gave him insight. When now her glance met his blue kindly eyes looking
intently at her, it seemed to her that he saw right through her, and understood
all that was not good that was passing within her. Reddening, she stretched out
towards him expecting a kiss, but he only patted her hair and said:
“These stupid chignons! There’s no getting at the real daughter.
One simply strokes the bristles of dead women. Well, Dolinka,” he turned
to his elder daughter, “what’s your young buck about, hey?”
“Nothing, father,” answered Dolly, understanding that her husband
was meant. “He’s always out; I scarcely ever see him,” she
could not resist adding with a sarcastic smile.
“Why, hasn’t he gone into the country yet—to see about
selling that forest?”
“No, he’s still getting ready for the journey.”
“Oh, that’s it!” said the prince. “And so am I to be
getting ready for a journey too? At your service,” he said to his wife,
sitting down. “And I tell you what, Katia,” he went on to his
younger daughter, “you must wake up one fine day and say to yourself:
Why, I’m quite well, and merry, and going out again with father for an
early morning walk in the frost. Hey?”
What her father said seemed simple enough, yet at these words Kitty became
confused and overcome like a detected criminal. “Yes, he sees it all, he
understands it all, and in these words he’s telling me that though
I’m ashamed, I must get over my shame.” She could not pluck up
spirit to make any answer. She tried to begin, and all at once burst into
tears, and rushed out of the room.
“See what comes of your jokes!” the princess pounced down on her
husband. “You’re always....” she began a string of reproaches.
The prince listened to the princess’s scolding rather a long while
without speaking, but his face was more and more frowning.
“She’s so much to be pitied, poor child, so much to be pitied, and
you don’t feel how it hurts her to hear the slightest reference to the
cause of it. Ah! to be so mistaken in people!” said the princess, and by
the change in her tone both Dolly and the prince knew she was speaking of
Vronsky. “I don’t know why there aren’t laws against such
base, dishonorable people.”
“Ah, I can’t bear to hear you!” said the prince gloomily,
getting up from his low chair, and seeming anxious to get away, yet stopping in
the doorway. “There are laws, madam, and since you’ve challenged me
to it, I’ll tell you who’s to blame for it all: you and you, you
and nobody else. Laws against such young gallants there have always been, and
there still are! Yes, if there has been nothing that ought not to have been,
old as I am, I’d have called him out to the barrier, the young dandy.
Yes, and now you physic her and call in these quacks.”
The prince apparently had plenty more to say, but as soon as the princess heard
his tone she subsided at once, and became penitent, as she always did on
serious occasions.
“Alexander, Alexander,” she whispered, moving to him and beginning
to weep.
As soon as she began to cry the prince too calmed down. He went up to her.
“There, that’s enough, that’s enough! You’re wretched
too, I know. It can’t be helped. There’s no great harm done. God is
merciful ... thanks....” he said, not knowing what he was saying, as he
responded to the tearful kiss of the princess that he felt on his hand. And the
prince went out of the room.
Before this, as soon as Kitty went out of the room in tears, Dolly, with her
motherly, family instincts, had promptly perceived that here a woman’s
work lay before her, and she prepared to do it. She took off her hat, and,
morally speaking, tucked up her sleeves and prepared for action. While her
mother was attacking her father, she tried to restrain her mother, so far as
filial reverence would allow. During the prince’s outburst she was
silent; she felt ashamed for her mother, and tender towards her father for so
quickly being kind again. But when her father left them she made ready for what
was the chief thing needful—to go to Kitty and console her.
“I’d been meaning to tell you something for a long while, mamma:
did you know that Levin meant to make Kitty an offer when he was here the last
time? He told Stiva so.”
“Well, what then? I don’t understand....”
“So did Kitty perhaps refuse him?... She didn’t tell you so?”
“No, she has said nothing to me either of one or the other; she’s
too proud. But I know it’s all on account of the other.”
“Yes, but suppose she has refused Levin, and she wouldn’t have
refused him if it hadn’t been for the other, I know. And then, he has
deceived her so horribly.”
It was too terrible for the princess to think how she had sinned against her
daughter, and she broke out angrily.
“Oh, I really don’t understand! Nowadays they will all go their own
way, and mothers haven’t a word to say in anything, and then....”
“Mamma, I’ll go up to her.”
“Well, do. Did I tell you not to?” said her mother.
When she went into Kitty’s little room, a pretty, pink little room, full
of knick-knacks in vieux saxe, as fresh, and pink, and white, and gay as
Kitty herself had been two months ago, Dolly remembered how they had decorated
the room the year before together, with what love and gaiety. Her heart turned
cold when she saw Kitty sitting on a low chair near the door, her eyes fixed
immovably on a corner of the rug. Kitty glanced at her sister, and the cold,
rather ill-tempered expression of her face did not change.
“I’m just going now, and I shall have to keep in and you
won’t be able to come to see me,” said Dolly, sitting down beside
her. “I want to talk to you.”
“What about?” Kitty asked swiftly, lifting her head in dismay.
“What should it be, but your trouble?”
“I have no trouble.”
“Nonsense, Kitty. Do you suppose I could help knowing? I know all about
it. And believe me, it’s of so little consequence.... We’ve all
been through it.”
Kitty did not speak, and her face had a stern expression.
“He’s not worth your grieving over him,” pursued Darya
Alexandrovna, coming straight to the point.
“No, because he has treated me with contempt,” said Kitty, in a
breaking voice. “Don’t talk of it! Please, don’t talk of
it!”
“But who can have told you so? No one has said that. I’m certain he
was in love with you, and would still be in love with you, if it
hadn’t....”
“Oh, the most awful thing of all for me is this sympathizing!”
shrieked Kitty, suddenly flying into a passion. She turned round on her chair,
flushed crimson, and rapidly moving her fingers, pinched the clasp of her belt
first with one hand and then with the other. Dolly knew this trick her sister
had of clenching her hands when she was much excited; she knew, too, that in
moments of excitement Kitty was capable of forgetting herself and saying a
great deal too much, and Dolly would have soothed her, but it was too late.
“What, what is it you want to make me feel, eh?” said Kitty
quickly. “That I’ve been in love with a man who didn’t care a
straw for me, and that I’m dying of love for him? And this is said to me
by my own sister, who imagines that ... that ... that she’s sympathizing
with me!... I don’t want these condolences and humbug!”
“Kitty, you’re unjust.”
“Why are you tormenting me?”
“But I ... quite the contrary ... I see you’re unhappy....”
But Kitty in her fury did not hear her.
“I’ve nothing to grieve over and be comforted about. I am too proud
ever to allow myself to care for a man who does not love me.”
“Yes, I don’t say so either.... Only one thing. Tell me the
truth,” said Darya Alexandrovna, taking her by the hand: “tell me,
did Levin speak to you?...”
The mention of Levin’s name seemed to deprive Kitty of the last vestige
of self-control. She leaped up from her chair, and flinging her clasp on the
ground, she gesticulated rapidly with her hands and said:
“Why bring Levin in too? I can’t understand what you want to
torment me for. I’ve told you, and I say it again, that I have some
pride, and never, never would I do as you’re doing—go back
to a man who’s deceived you, who has cared for another woman. I
can’t understand it! You may, but I can’t!”
And saying these words she glanced at her sister, and seeing that Dolly sat
silent, her head mournfully bowed, Kitty, instead of running out of the room as
she had meant to do, sat down near the door, and hid her face in her
handkerchief.
The silence lasted for two minutes: Dolly was thinking of herself. That
humiliation of which she was always conscious came back to her with a peculiar
bitterness when her sister reminded her of it. She had not looked for such
cruelty in her sister, and she was angry with her. But suddenly she heard the
rustle of a skirt, and with it the sound of heart-rending, smothered sobbing,
and felt arms about her neck. Kitty was on her knees before her.
“Dolinka, I am so, so wretched!” she whispered penitently. And the
sweet face covered with tears hid itself in Darya Alexandrovna’s skirt.
As though tears were the indispensable oil, without which the machinery of
mutual confidence could not run smoothly between the two sisters, the sisters
after their tears talked, not of what was uppermost in their minds, but, though
they talked of outside matters, they understood each other. Kitty knew that the
words she had uttered in anger about her husband’s infidelity and her
humiliating position had cut her poor sister to the heart, but that she had
forgiven her. Dolly for her part knew all she had wanted to find out. She felt
certain that her surmises were correct; that Kitty’s misery, her
inconsolable misery, was due precisely to the fact that Levin had made her an
offer and she had refused him, and Vronsky had deceived her, and that she was
fully prepared to love Levin and to detest Vronsky. Kitty said not a word of
that; she talked of nothing but her spiritual condition.
“I have nothing to make me miserable,” she said, getting calmer;
“but can you understand that everything has become hateful, loathsome,
coarse to me, and I myself most of all? You can’t imagine what loathsome
thoughts I have about everything.”
“Why, whatever loathsome thoughts can you have?” asked Dolly,
smiling.
“The most utterly loathsome and coarse: I can’t tell you.
It’s not unhappiness, or low spirits, but much worse. As though
everything that was good in me was all hidden away, and nothing was left but
the most loathsome. Come, how am I to tell you?” she went on, seeing the
puzzled look in her sister’s eyes. “Father began saying something
to me just now.... It seems to me he thinks all I want is to be married. Mother
takes me to a ball: it seems to me she only takes me to get me married off as
soon as may be, and be rid of me. I know it’s not the truth, but I
can’t drive away such thoughts. Eligible suitors, as they call
them—I can’t bear to see them. It seems to me they’re taking
stock of me and summing me up. In old days to go anywhere in a ball dress was a
simple joy to me, I admired myself; now I feel ashamed and awkward. And then!
The doctor.... Then....” Kitty hesitated; she wanted to say further that
ever since this change had taken place in her, Stepan Arkadyevitch had become
insufferably repulsive to her, and that she could not see him without the
grossest and most hideous conceptions rising before her imagination.
“Oh, well, everything presents itself to me, in the coarsest, most
loathsome light,” she went on. “That’s my illness. Perhaps it
will pass off.”
“But you mustn’t think about it.”
“I can’t help it. I’m never happy except with the children at
your house.”
“What a pity you can’t be with me!”
“Oh, yes, I’m coming. I’ve had scarlatina, and I’ll
persuade mamma to let me.”
Kitty insisted on having her way, and went to stay at her sister’s and
nursed the children all through the scarlatina, for scarlatina it turned out to
be. The two sisters brought all the six children successfully through it, but
Kitty was no better in health, and in Lent the Shtcherbatskys went abroad.
The highest Petersburg society is essentially one: in it everyone knows
everyone else, everyone even visits everyone else. But this great set has its
subdivisions. Anna Arkadyevna Karenina had friends and close ties in three
different circles of this highest society. One circle was her husband’s
government official set, consisting of his colleagues and subordinates, brought
together in the most various and capricious manner, and belonging to different
social strata. Anna found it difficult now to recall the feeling of almost
awe-stricken reverence which she had at first entertained for these persons.
Now she knew all of them as people know one another in a country town; she knew
their habits and weaknesses, and where the shoe pinched each one of them. She
knew their relations with one another and with the head authorities, knew who
was for whom, and how each one maintained his position, and where they agreed
and disagreed. But the circle of political, masculine interests had never
interested her, in spite of countess Lidia Ivanovna’s influence, and she
avoided it.
Another little set with which Anna was in close relations was the one by means
of which Alexey Alexandrovitch had made his career. The center of this circle
was the Countess Lidia Ivanovna. It was a set made up of elderly, ugly,
benevolent, and godly women, and clever, learned, and ambitious men. One of the
clever people belonging to the set had called it “the conscience of
Petersburg society.” Alexey Alexandrovitch had the highest esteem for
this circle, and Anna with her special gift for getting on with everyone, had
in the early days of her life in Petersburg made friends in this circle also.
Now, since her return from Moscow, she had come to feel this set insufferable.
It seemed to her that both she and all of them were insincere, and she felt so
bored and ill at ease in that world that she went to see the Countess Lidia
Ivanovna as little as possible.
The third circle with which Anna had ties was preeminently the fashionable
world—the world of balls, of dinners, of sumptuous dresses, the world
that hung on to the court with one hand, so as to avoid sinking to the level of
the demi-monde. For the demi-monde the members of that fashionable world
believed that they despised, though their tastes were not merely similar, but
in fact identical. Her connection with this circle was kept up through Princess
Betsy Tverskaya, her cousin’s wife, who had an income of a hundred and
twenty thousand roubles, and who had taken a great fancy to Anna ever since she
first came out, showed her much attention, and drew her into her set, making
fun of Countess Lidia Ivanovna’s coterie.
“When I’m old and ugly I’ll be the same,” Betsy used to
say; “but for a pretty young woman like you it’s early days for
that house of charity.”
Anna had at first avoided as far as she could Princess Tverskaya’s world,
because it necessitated an expenditure beyond her means, and besides in her
heart she preferred the first circle. But since her visit to Moscow she had
done quite the contrary. She avoided her serious-minded friends, and went out
into the fashionable world. There she met Vronsky, and experienced an agitating
joy at those meetings. She met Vronsky specially often at Betsy’s for
Betsy was a Vronsky by birth and his cousin. Vronsky was everywhere where he
had any chance of meeting Anna, and speaking to her, when he could, of his
love. She gave him no encouragement, but every time she met him there surged up
in her heart that same feeling of quickened life that had come upon her that
day in the railway carriage when she saw him for the first time. She was
conscious herself that her delight sparkled in her eyes and curved her lips
into a smile, and she could not quench the expression of this delight.
At first Anna sincerely believed that she was displeased with him for daring to
pursue her. Soon after her return from Moscow, on arriving at a soirée
where she had expected to meet him, and not finding him there, she realized
distinctly from the rush of disappointment that she had been deceiving herself,
and that this pursuit was not merely not distasteful to her, but that it made
the whole interest of her life.
The celebrated singer was singing for the second time, and all the fashionable
world was in the theater. Vronsky, seeing his cousin from his stall in the
front row, did not wait till the entr’acte, but went to her box.
“Why didn’t you come to dinner?” she said to him. “I
marvel at the second sight of lovers,” she added with a smile, so that no
one but he could hear; “she wasn’t there. But come after the
opera.”
Vronsky looked inquiringly at her. She nodded. He thanked her by a smile, and
sat down beside her.
“But how I remember your jeers!” continued Princess Betsy, who took
a peculiar pleasure in following up this passion to a successful issue.
“What’s become of all that? You’re caught, my dear
boy.”
“That’s my one desire, to be caught,” answered Vronsky, with
his serene, good-humored smile. “If I complain of anything it’s
only that I’m not caught enough, to tell the truth. I begin to lose
hope.”
“Why, whatever hope can you have?” said Betsy, offended on behalf
of her friend. “Entendons nous....” But in her eyes there
were gleams of light that betrayed that she understood perfectly and precisely
as he did what hope he might have.
“None whatever,” said Vronsky, laughing and showing his even rows
of teeth. “Excuse me,” he added, taking an opera-glass out of her
hand, and proceeding to scrutinize, over her bare shoulder, the row of boxes
facing them. “I’m afraid I’m becoming ridiculous.”
He was very well aware that he ran no risk of being ridiculous in the eyes of
Betsy or any other fashionable people. He was very well aware that in their
eyes the position of an unsuccessful lover of a girl, or of any woman free to
marry, might be ridiculous. But the position of a man pursuing a married woman,
and, regardless of everything, staking his life on drawing her into adultery,
has something fine and grand about it, and can never be ridiculous; and so it
was with a proud and gay smile under his mustaches that he lowered the
opera-glass and looked at his cousin.
“But why was it you didn’t come to dinner?” she said,
admiring him.
“I must tell you about that. I was busily employed, and doing what, do
you suppose? I’ll give you a hundred guesses, a thousand ... you’d
never guess. I’ve been reconciling a husband with a man who’d
insulted his wife. Yes, really!”
“Well, did you succeed?”
“Almost.”
“You really must tell me about it,” she said, getting up.
“Come to me in the next entr’acte.”
“I can’t; I’m going to the French theater.”
“From Nilsson?” Betsy queried in horror, though she could not
herself have distinguished Nilsson’s voice from any chorus girl’s.
“Can’t help it. I’ve an appointment there, all to do with my
mission of peace.”
“‘Blessed are the peacemakers; theirs is the kingdom of
heaven,’” said Betsy, vaguely recollecting she had heard some
similar saying from someone. “Very well, then, sit down, and tell me what
it’s all about.”
And she sat down again.
“This is rather indiscreet, but it’s so good it’s an awful
temptation to tell the story,” said Vronsky, looking at her with his
laughing eyes. “I’m not going to mention any names.”
“But I shall guess, so much the better.”
“Well, listen: two festive young men were driving—”
“Officers of your regiment, of course?”
“I didn’t say they were officers,—two young men who had been
lunching.”
“In other words, drinking.”
“Possibly. They were driving on their way to dinner with a friend in the
most festive state of mind. And they beheld a pretty woman in a hired sledge;
she overtakes them, looks round at them, and, so they fancy anyway, nods to
them and laughs. They, of course, follow her. They gallop at full speed. To
their amazement, the fair one alights at the entrance of the very house to
which they were going. The fair one darts upstairs to the top story. They get a
glimpse of red lips under a short veil, and exquisite little feet.”
“You describe it with such feeling that I fancy you must be one of the
two.”
“And after what you said, just now! Well, the young men go in to their
comrade’s; he was giving a farewell dinner. There they certainly did
drink a little too much, as one always does at farewell dinners. And at dinner
they inquire who lives at the top in that house. No one knows; only their
host’s valet, in answer to their inquiry whether any ‘young
ladies’ are living on the top floor, answered that there were a great
many of them about there. After dinner the two young men go into their
host’s study, and write a letter to the unknown fair one. They compose an
ardent epistle, a declaration in fact, and they carry the letter upstairs
themselves, so as to elucidate whatever might appear not perfectly intelligible
in the letter.”
“Why are you telling me these horrible stories? Well?”
“They ring. A maid-servant opens the door, they hand her the letter, and
assure the maid that they’re both so in love that they’ll die on
the spot at the door. The maid, stupefied, carries in their messages. All at
once a gentleman appears with whiskers like sausages, as red as a lobster,
announces that there is no one living in the flat except his wife, and sends
them both about their business.”
“How do you know he had whiskers like sausages, as you say?”
“Ah, you shall hear. I’ve just been to make peace between
them.”
“Well, and what then?”
“That’s the most interesting part of the story. It appears that
it’s a happy couple, a government clerk and his lady. The government
clerk lodges a complaint, and I became a mediator, and such a mediator!... I
assure you Talleyrand couldn’t hold a candle to me.”
“Why, where was the difficulty?”
“Ah, you shall hear.... We apologize in due form: we are in despair, we
entreat forgiveness for the unfortunate misunderstanding. The government clerk
with the sausages begins to melt, but he, too, desires to express his
sentiments, and as soon as ever he begins to express them, he begins to get hot
and say nasty things, and again I’m obliged to trot out all my diplomatic
talents. I allowed that their conduct was bad, but I urged him to take into
consideration their heedlessness, their youth; then, too, the young men had
only just been lunching together. ‘You understand. They regret it deeply,
and beg you to overlook their misbehavior.’ The government clerk was
softened once more. ‘I consent, count, and am ready to overlook it; but
you perceive that my wife—my wife’s a respectable woman—has
been exposed to the persecution, and insults, and effrontery of young upstarts,
scoundrels....’ And you must understand, the young upstarts are present
all the while, and I have to keep the peace between them. Again I call out all
my diplomacy, and again as soon as the thing was about at an end, our friend
the government clerk gets hot and red, and his sausages stand on end with
wrath, and once more I launch out into diplomatic wiles.”
“Ah, he must tell you this story!” said Betsy, laughing, to a lady
who came into her box. “He has been making me laugh so.”
“Well, bonne chance!” she added, giving Vronsky one finger
of the hand in which she held her fan, and with a shrug of her shoulders she
twitched down the bodice of her gown that had worked up, so as to be duly naked
as she moved forward towards the footlights into the light of the gas, and the
sight of all eyes.
Vronsky drove to the French theater, where he really had to see the colonel of
his regiment, who never missed a single performance there. He wanted to see
him, to report on the result of his mediation, which had occupied and amused
him for the last three days. Petritsky, whom he liked, was implicated in the
affair, and the other culprit was a capital fellow and first-rate comrade, who
had lately joined the regiment, the young Prince Kedrov. And what was most
important, the interests of the regiment were involved in it too.
Both the young men were in Vronsky’s company. The colonel of the regiment
was waited upon by the government clerk, Venden, with a complaint against his
officers, who had insulted his wife. His young wife, so Venden told the
story—he had been married half a year—was at church with her
mother, and suddenly overcome by indisposition, arising from her interesting
condition, she could not remain standing, she drove home in the first sledge, a
smart-looking one, she came across. On the spot the officers set off in pursuit
of her; she was alarmed, and feeling still more unwell, ran up the staircase
home. Venden himself, on returning from his office, heard a ring at their bell
and voices, went out, and seeing the intoxicated officers with a letter, he had
turned them out. He asked for exemplary punishment.
“Yes, it’s all very well,” said the colonel to Vronsky, whom
he had invited to come and see him. “Petritsky’s becoming
impossible. Not a week goes by without some scandal. This government clerk
won’t let it drop, he’ll go on with the thing.”
Vronsky saw all the thanklessness of the business, and that there could be no
question of a duel in it, that everything must be done to soften the government
clerk, and hush the matter up. The colonel had called in Vronsky just because
he knew him to be an honorable and intelligent man, and, more than all, a man
who cared for the honor of the regiment. They talked it over, and decided that
Petritsky and Kedrov must go with Vronsky to Venden’s to apologize. The
colonel and Vronsky were both fully aware that Vronsky’s name and rank
would be sure to contribute greatly to the softening of the injured
husband’s feelings.
And these two influences were not in fact without effect; though the result
remained, as Vronsky had described, uncertain.
On reaching the French theater, Vronsky retired to the foyer with the colonel,
and reported to him his success, or non-success. The colonel, thinking it all
over, made up his mind not to pursue the matter further, but then for his own
satisfaction proceeded to cross-examine Vronsky about his interview; and it was
a long while before he could restrain his laughter, as Vronsky described how
the government clerk, after subsiding for a while, would suddenly flare up
again, as he recalled the details, and how Vronsky, at the last half word of
conciliation, skillfully manœuvered a retreat, shoving Petritsky out before
him.
“It’s a disgraceful story, but killing. Kedrov really can’t
fight the gentleman! Was he so awfully hot?” he commented, laughing.
“But what do you say to Claire today? She’s marvelous,” he
went on, speaking of a new French actress. “However often you see her,
every day she’s different. It’s only the French who can do
that.”
Princess Betsy drove home from the theater, without waiting for the end of the
last act. She had only just time to go into her dressing-room, sprinkle her
long, pale face with powder, rub it, set her dress to rights, and order tea in
the big drawing-room, when one after another carriages drove up to her huge
house in Bolshaia Morskaia. Her guests stepped out at the wide entrance, and
the stout porter, who used to read the newspapers in the mornings behind the
glass door, to the edification of the passers-by, noiselessly opened the
immense door, letting the visitors pass by him into the house.
Almost at the same instant the hostess, with freshly arranged coiffure and
freshened face, walked in at one door and her guests at the other door of the
drawing-room, a large room with dark walls, downy rugs, and a brightly lighted
table, gleaming with the light of candles, white cloth, silver samovar, and
transparent china tea-things.
The hostess sat down at the table and took off her gloves. Chairs were set with
the aid of footmen, moving almost imperceptibly about the room; the party
settled itself, divided into two groups: one round the samovar near the
hostess, the other at the opposite end of the drawing-room, round the handsome
wife of an ambassador, in black velvet, with sharply defined black eyebrows. In
both groups conversation wavered, as it always does, for the first few minutes,
broken up by meetings, greetings, offers of tea, and as it were, feeling about
for something to rest upon.
“She’s exceptionally good as an actress; one can see she’s
studied Kaulbach,” said a diplomatic attaché in the group round the
ambassador’s wife. “Did you notice how she fell down?...”
“Oh, please, don’t let us talk about Nilsson! No one can possibly
say anything new about her,” said a fat, red-faced, flaxen-headed lady,
without eyebrows and chignon, wearing an old silk dress. This was Princess
Myakaya, noted for her simplicity and the roughness of her manners, and
nicknamed enfant terrible. Princess Myakaya, sitting in the middle
between the two groups, and listening to both, took part in the conversation
first of one and then of the other. “Three people have used that very
phrase about Kaulbach to me today already, just as though they had made a
compact about it. And I can’t see why they liked that remark so.”
The conversation was cut short by this observation, and a new subject had to be
thought of again.
“Do tell me something amusing but not spiteful,” said the
ambassador’s wife, a great proficient in the art of that elegant
conversation called by the English small talk. She addressed the
attaché, who was at a loss now what to begin upon.
“They say that that’s a difficult task, that nothing’s
amusing that isn’t spiteful,” he began with a smile. “But
I’ll try. Get me a subject. It all lies in the subject. If a
subject’s given me, it’s easy to spin something round it. I often
think that the celebrated talkers of the last century would have found it
difficult to talk cleverly now. Everything clever is so stale....”
“That has been said long ago,” the ambassador’s wife
interrupted him, laughing.
The conversation began amiably, but just because it was too amiable, it came to
a stop again. They had to have recourse to the sure, never-failing
topic—gossip.
“Don’t you think there’s something Louis Quinze about
Tushkevitch?” he said, glancing towards a handsome, fair-haired young
man, standing at the table.
“Oh, yes! He’s in the same style as the drawing-room and
that’s why it is he’s so often here.”
This conversation was maintained, since it rested on allusions to what could
not be talked of in that room—that is to say, of the relations of
Tushkevitch with their hostess.
Round the samovar and the hostess the conversation had been meanwhile
vacillating in just the same way between three inevitable topics: the latest
piece of public news, the theater, and scandal. It, too, came finally to rest
on the last topic, that is, ill-natured gossip.
“Have you heard the Maltishtcheva woman—the mother, not the
daughter—has ordered a costume in diable rose color?”
“Nonsense! No, that’s too lovely!”
“I wonder that with her sense—for she’s not a fool, you
know—that she doesn’t see how funny she is.”
Everyone had something to say in censure or ridicule of the luckless Madame
Maltishtcheva, and the conversation crackled merrily, like a burning
faggot-stack.
The husband of Princess Betsy, a good-natured fat man, an ardent collector of
engravings, hearing that his wife had visitors, came into the drawing-room
before going to his club. Stepping noiselessly over the thick rugs, he went up
to Princess Myakaya.
“How did you like Nilsson?” he asked.
“Oh, how can you steal upon anyone like that! How you startled me!”
she responded. “Please don’t talk to me about the opera; you know
nothing about music. I’d better meet you on your own ground, and talk
about your majolica and engravings. Come now, what treasure have you been
buying lately at the old curiosity shops?”
“Would you like me to show you? But you don’t understand such
things.”
“Oh, do show me! I’ve been learning about them at
those—what’s their names?... the bankers ... they’ve some
splendid engravings. They showed them to us.”
“Why, have you been at the Schützburgs?” asked the hostess from the
samovar.
“Yes, ma chère. They asked my husband and me to dinner, and told
us the sauce at that dinner cost a hundred pounds,” Princess Myakaya
said, speaking loudly, and conscious everyone was listening; “and very
nasty sauce it was, some green mess. We had to ask them, and I made them sauce
for eighteen pence, and everybody was very much pleased with it. I can’t
run to hundred-pound sauces.”
“She’s unique!” said the lady of the house.
“Marvelous!” said someone.
The sensation produced by Princess Myakaya’s speeches was always unique,
and the secret of the sensation she produced lay in the fact that though she
spoke not always appropriately, as now, she said simple things with some sense
in them. In the society in which she lived such plain statements produced the
effect of the wittiest epigram. Princess Myakaya could never see why it had
that effect, but she knew it had, and took advantage of it.
As everyone had been listening while Princess Myakaya spoke, and so the
conversation around the ambassador’s wife had dropped, Princess Betsy
tried to bring the whole party together, and turned to the ambassador’s
wife.
“Will you really not have tea? You should come over here by us.”
“No, we’re very happy here,” the ambassador’s wife
responded with a smile, and she went on with the conversation that had been
begun.
It was a very agreeable conversation. They were criticizing the Karenins,
husband and wife.
“Anna is quite changed since her stay in Moscow. There’s something
strange about her,” said her friend.
“The great change is that she brought back with her the shadow of Alexey
Vronsky,” said the ambassador’s wife.
“Well, what of it? There’s a fable of Grimm’s about a man
without a shadow, a man who’s lost his shadow. And that’s his
punishment for something. I never could understand how it was a punishment. But
a woman must dislike being without a shadow.”
“Yes, but women with a shadow usually come to a bad end,” said
Anna’s friend.
“Bad luck to your tongue!” said Princess Myakaya suddenly.
“Madame Karenina’s a splendid woman. I don’t like her
husband, but I like her very much.”
“Why don’t you like her husband? He’s such a remarkable
man,” said the ambassador’s wife. “My husband says there are
few statesmen like him in Europe.”
“And my husband tells me just the same, but I don’t believe
it,” said Princess Myakaya. “If our husbands didn’t talk to
us, we should see the facts as they are. Alexey Alexandrovitch, to my thinking,
is simply a fool. I say it in a whisper ... but doesn’t it really make
everything clear? Before, when I was told to consider him clever, I kept
looking for his ability, and thought myself a fool for not seeing it; but
directly I said, he’s a fool, though only in a whisper,
everything’s explained, isn’t it?”
“How spiteful you are today!”
“Not a bit. I’d no other way out of it. One of the two had to be a
fool. And, well, you know one can’t say that of oneself.”
“‘No one is satisfied with his fortune, and everyone is satisfied
with his wit.’” The attaché repeated the French saying.
“That’s just it, just it,” Princess Myakaya turned to him.
“But the point is that I won’t abandon Anna to your mercies.
She’s so nice, so charming. How can she help it if they’re all in
love with her, and follow her about like shadows?”
“Oh, I had no idea of blaming her for it,” Anna’s friend said
in self-defense.
“If no one follows us about like a shadow, that’s no proof that
we’ve any right to blame her.”
And having duly disposed of Anna’s friend, the Princess Myakaya got up,
and together with the ambassador’s wife, joined the group at the table,
where the conversation was dealing with the king of Prussia.
“What wicked gossip were you talking over there?” asked Betsy.
“About the Karenins. The princess gave us a sketch of Alexey
Alexandrovitch,” said the ambassador’s wife with a smile, as she
sat down at the table.
“Pity we didn’t hear it!” said Princess Betsy, glancing
towards the door. “Ah, here you are at last!” she said, turning
with a smile to Vronsky, as he came in.
Vronsky was not merely acquainted with all the persons whom he was meeting
here; he saw them all every day; and so he came in with the quiet manner with
which one enters a room full of people from whom one has only just parted.
“Where do I come from?” he said, in answer to a question from the
ambassador’s wife. “Well, there’s no help for it, I must
confess. From the opera bouffe. I do believe I’ve seen it a
hundred times, and always with fresh enjoyment. It’s exquisite! I know
it’s disgraceful, but I go to sleep at the opera, and I sit out the
opera bouffe to the last minute, and enjoy it. This evening....”
He mentioned a French actress, and was going to tell something about her; but
the ambassador’s wife, with playful horror, cut him short.
“Please don’t tell us about that horror.”
“All right, I won’t especially as everyone knows those
horrors.”
“And we should all go to see them if it were accepted as the correct
thing, like the opera,” chimed in Princess Myakaya.
Steps were heard at the door, and Princess Betsy, knowing it was Madame
Karenina, glanced at Vronsky. He was looking towards the door, and his face
wore a strange new expression. Joyfully, intently, and at the same time
timidly, he gazed at the approaching figure, and slowly he rose to his feet.
Anna walked into the drawing-room. Holding herself extremely erect, as always,
looking straight before her, and moving with her swift, resolute, and light
step, that distinguished her from all other society women, she crossed the
short space to her hostess, shook hands with her, smiled, and with the same
smile looked around at Vronsky. Vronsky bowed low and pushed a chair up for
her.
She acknowledged this only by a slight nod, flushed a little, and frowned. But
immediately, while rapidly greeting her acquaintances, and shaking the hands
proffered to her, she addressed Princess Betsy:
“I have been at Countess Lidia’s, and meant to have come here
earlier, but I stayed on. Sir John was there. He’s very
interesting.”
“Oh, that’s this missionary?”
“Yes; he told us about the life in India, most interesting things.”
The conversation, interrupted by her coming in, flickered up again like the
light of a lamp being blown out.
“Sir John! Yes, Sir John; I’ve seen him. He speaks well. The
Vlassieva girl’s quite in love with him.”
“And is it true the younger Vlassieva girl’s to marry Topov?”
“Yes, they say it’s quite a settled thing.”
“I wonder at the parents! They say it’s a marriage for love.”
“For love? What antediluvian notions you have! Can one talk of love in
these days?” said the ambassador’s wife.
“What’s to be done? It’s a foolish old fashion that’s
kept up still,” said Vronsky.
“So much the worse for those who keep up the fashion. The only happy
marriages I know are marriages of prudence.”
“Yes, but then how often the happiness of these prudent marriages flies
away like dust just because that passion turns up that they have refused to
recognize,” said Vronsky.
“But by marriages of prudence we mean those in which both parties have
sown their wild oats already. That’s like scarlatina—one has to go
through it and get it over.”
“Then they ought to find out how to vaccinate for love, like
smallpox.”
“I was in love in my young days with a deacon,” said the Princess
Myakaya. “I don’t know that it did me any good.”
“No; I imagine, joking apart, that to know love, one must make mistakes
and then correct them,” said Princess Betsy.
“Even after marriage?” said the ambassador’s wife playfully.
“‘It’s never too late to mend.’” The attaché
repeated the English proverb.
“Just so,” Betsy agreed; “one must make mistakes and correct
them. What do you think about it?” she turned to Anna, who, with a
faintly perceptible resolute smile on her lips, was listening in silence to the
conversation.
“I think,” said Anna, playing with the glove she had taken off,
“I think ... of so many men, so many minds, certainly so many hearts, so
many kinds of love.”
Vronsky was gazing at Anna, and with a fainting heart waiting for what she
would say. He sighed as after a danger escaped when she uttered these words.
Anna suddenly turned to him.
“Oh, I have had a letter from Moscow. They write me that Kitty
Shtcherbatskaya’s very ill.”
“Really?” said Vronsky, knitting his brows.
Anna looked sternly at him.
“That doesn’t interest you?”
“On the contrary, it does, very much. What was it exactly they told you,
if I may know?” he questioned.
Anna got up and went to Betsy.
“Give me a cup of tea,” she said, standing at her table.
While Betsy was pouring out the tea, Vronsky went up to Anna.
“What is it they write to you?” he repeated.
“I often think men have no understanding of what’s not honorable
though they’re always talking of it,” said Anna, without answering
him. “I’ve wanted to tell you so a long while,” she added,
and moving a few steps away, she sat down at a table in a corner covered with
albums.
“I don’t quite understand the meaning of your words,” he
said, handing her the cup.
She glanced towards the sofa beside her, and he instantly sat down.
“Yes, I have been wanting to tell you,” she said, not looking at
him. “You behaved wrongly, very wrongly.”
“Do you suppose I don’t know that I’ve acted wrongly? But who
was the cause of my doing so?”
“What do you say that to me for?” she said, glancing severely at
him.
“You know what for,” he answered boldly and joyfully, meeting her
glance and not dropping his eyes.
Not he, but she, was confused.
“That only shows you have no heart,” she said. But her eyes said
that she knew he had a heart, and that was why she was afraid of him.
“What you spoke of just now was a mistake, and not love.”
“Remember that I have forbidden you to utter that word, that hateful
word,” said Anna, with a shudder. But at once she felt that by that very
word “forbidden” she had shown that she acknowledged certain rights
over him, and by that very fact was encouraging him to speak of love. “I
have long meant to tell you this,” she went on, looking resolutely into
his eyes, and hot all over from the burning flush on her cheeks.
“I’ve come on purpose this evening, knowing I should meet you. I
have come to tell you that this must end. I have never blushed before anyone,
and you force me to feel to blame for something.”
He looked at her and was struck by a new spiritual beauty in her face.
“What do you wish of me?” he said simply and seriously.
“I want you to go to Moscow and ask for Kitty’s forgiveness,”
she said.
“You don’t wish that?” he said.
He saw she was saying what she forced herself to say, not what she wanted to
say.
“If you love me, as you say,” she whispered, “do so that I
may be at peace.”
His face grew radiant.
“Don’t you know that you’re all my life to me? But I know no
peace, and I can’t give it to you; all myself—and love ... yes. I
can’t think of you and myself apart. You and I are one to me. And I see
no chance before us of peace for me or for you. I see a chance of despair, of
wretchedness ... or I see a chance of bliss, what bliss!... Can it be
there’s no chance of it?” he murmured with his lips; but she heard.
She strained every effort of her mind to say what ought to be said. But instead
of that she let her eyes rest on him, full of love, and made no answer.
“It’s come!” he thought in ecstasy. “When I was
beginning to despair, and it seemed there would be no end—it’s
come! She loves me! She owns it!”
“Then do this for me: never say such things to me, and let us be
friends,” she said in words; but her eyes spoke quite differently.
“Friends we shall never be, you know that yourself. Whether we shall be
the happiest or the wretchedest of people—that’s in your
hands.”
She would have said something, but he interrupted her.
“I ask one thing only: I ask for the right to hope, to suffer as I do.
But if even that cannot be, command me to disappear, and I disappear. You shall
not see me if my presence is distasteful to you.”
“I don’t want to drive you away.”
“Only don’t change anything, leave everything as it is,” he
said in a shaky voice. “Here’s your husband.”
At that instant Alexey Alexandrovitch did in fact walk into the room with his
calm, awkward gait.
Glancing at his wife and Vronsky, he went up to the lady of the house, and
sitting down for a cup of tea, began talking in his deliberate, always audible
voice, in his habitual tone of banter, ridiculing someone.
“Your Rambouillet is in full conclave,” he said, looking round at
all the party; “the graces and the muses.”
But Princess Betsy could not endure that tone of
his—“sneering,” as she called it, using the English word, and
like a skillful hostess she at once brought him into a serious conversation on
the subject of universal conscription. Alexey Alexandrovitch was immediately
interested in the subject, and began seriously defending the new imperial
decree against Princess Betsy, who had attacked it.
Vronsky and Anna still sat at the little table.
“This is getting indecorous,” whispered one lady, with an
expressive glance at Madame Karenina, Vronsky, and her husband.
“What did I tell you?” said Anna’s friend.
But not only those ladies, almost everyone in the room, even the Princess
Myakaya and Betsy herself, looked several times in the direction of the two who
had withdrawn from the general circle, as though that were a disturbing fact.
Alexey Alexandrovitch was the only person who did not once look in that
direction, and was not diverted from the interesting discussion he had entered
upon.
Noticing the disagreeable impression that was being made on everyone, Princess
Betsy slipped someone else into her place to listen to Alexey Alexandrovitch,
and went up to Anna.
“I’m always amazed at the clearness and precision of your
husband’s language,” she said. “The most transcendental ideas
seem to be within my grasp when he’s speaking.”
“Oh, yes!” said Anna, radiant with a smile of happiness, and not
understanding a word of what Betsy had said. She crossed over to the big table
and took part in the general conversation.
Alexey Alexandrovitch, after staying half an hour, went up to his wife and
suggested that they should go home together. But she answered, not looking at
him, that she was staying to supper. Alexey Alexandrovitch made his bows and
withdrew.
The fat old Tatar, Madame Karenina’s coachman, was with difficulty
holding one of her pair of grays, chilled with the cold and rearing at the
entrance. A footman stood opening the carriage door. The hall-porter stood
holding open the great door of the house. Anna Arkadyevna, with her quick
little hand, was unfastening the lace of her sleeve, caught in the hook of her
fur cloak, and with bent head listening to the words Vronsky murmured as he
escorted her down.
“You’ve said nothing, of course, and I ask nothing,” he was
saying; “but you know that friendship’s not what I want: that
there’s only one happiness in life for me, that word that you dislike so
... yes, love!...”
“Love,” she repeated slowly, in an inner voice, and suddenly, at
the very instant she unhooked the lace, she added, “Why I don’t
like the word is that it means too much to me, far more than you can
understand,” and she glanced into his face. “Au
revoir!”
She gave him her hand, and with her rapid, springy step she passed by the
porter and vanished into the carriage.
Her glance, the touch of her hand, set him aflame. He kissed the palm of his
hand where she had touched it, and went home, happy in the sense that he had
got nearer to the attainment of his aims that evening than during the last two
months.
Alexey Alexandrovitch had seen nothing striking or improper in the fact that
his wife was sitting with Vronsky at a table apart, in eager conversation with
him about something. But he noticed that to the rest of the party this appeared
something striking and improper, and for that reason it seemed to him too to be
improper. He made up his mind that he must speak of it to his wife.
On reaching home Alexey Alexandrovitch went to his study, as he usually did,
seated himself in his low chair, opened a book on the Papacy at the place where
he had laid the paper-knife in it, and read till one o’clock, just as he
usually did. But from time to time he rubbed his high forehead and shook his
head, as though to drive away something. At his usual time he got up and made
his toilet for the night. Anna Arkadyevna had not yet come in. With a book
under his arm he went upstairs. But this evening, instead of his usual thoughts
and meditations upon official details, his thoughts were absorbed by his wife
and something disagreeable connected with her. Contrary to his usual habit, he
did not get into bed, but fell to walking up and down the rooms with his hands
clasped behind his back. He could not go to bed, feeling that it was absolutely
needful for him first to think thoroughly over the position that had just
arisen.
When Alexey Alexandrovitch had made up his mind that he must talk to his wife
about it, it had seemed a very easy and simple matter. But now, when he began
to think over the question that had just presented itself, it seemed to him
very complicated and difficult.
Alexey Alexandrovitch was not jealous. Jealousy according to his notions was an
insult to one’s wife, and one ought to have confidence in one’s
wife. Why one ought to have confidence—that is to say, complete
conviction that his young wife would always love him—he did not ask
himself. But he had no experience of lack of confidence, because he had
confidence in her, and told himself that he ought to have it. Now, though his
conviction that jealousy was a shameful feeling and that one ought to feel
confidence, had not broken down, he felt that he was standing face to face with
something illogical and irrational, and did not know what was to be done.
Alexey Alexandrovitch was standing face to face with life, with the possibility
of his wife’s loving someone other than himself, and this seemed to him
very irrational and incomprehensible because it was life itself. All his life
Alexey Alexandrovitch had lived and worked in official spheres, having to do
with the reflection of life. And every time he had stumbled against life itself
he had shrunk away from it. Now he experienced a feeling akin to that of a man
who, while calmly crossing a precipice by a bridge, should suddenly discover
that the bridge is broken, and that there is a chasm below. That chasm was life
itself, the bridge that artificial life in which Alexey Alexandrovitch had
lived. For the first time the question presented itself to him of the
possibility of his wife’s loving someone else, and he was horrified at
it.
He did not undress, but walked up and down with his regular tread over the
resounding parquet of the dining-room, where one lamp was burning, over the
carpet of the dark drawing-room, in which the light was reflected on the big
new portrait of himself hanging over the sofa, and across her boudoir, where
two candles burned, lighting up the portraits of her parents and woman friends,
and the pretty knick-knacks of her writing-table, that he knew so well. He
walked across her boudoir to the bedroom door, and turned back again. At each
turn in his walk, especially at the parquet of the lighted dining-room, he
halted and said to himself, “Yes, this I must decide and put a stop to; I
must express my view of it and my decision.” And he turned back again.
“But express what—what decision?” he said to himself in the
drawing-room, and he found no reply. “But after all,” he asked
himself before turning into the boudoir, “what has occurred? Nothing. She
was talking a long while with him. But what of that? Surely women in society
can talk to whom they please. And then, jealousy means lowering both myself and
her,” he told himself as he went into her boudoir; but this dictum, which
had always had such weight with him before, had now no weight and no meaning at
all. And from the bedroom door he turned back again; but as he entered the dark
drawing-room some inner voice told him that it was not so, and that if others
noticed it that showed that there was something. And he said to himself again
in the dining-room, “Yes, I must decide and put a stop to it, and express
my view of it....” And again at the turn in the drawing-room he asked
himself, “Decide how?” And again he asked himself, “What had
occurred?” and answered, “Nothing,” and recollected that
jealousy was a feeling insulting to his wife; but again in the drawing-room he
was convinced that something had happened. His thoughts, like his body, went
round a complete circle, without coming upon anything new. He noticed this,
rubbed his forehead, and sat down in her boudoir.
There, looking at her table, with the malachite blotting case lying at the top
and an unfinished letter, his thoughts suddenly changed. He began to think of
her, of what she was thinking and feeling. For the first time he pictured
vividly to himself her personal life, her ideas, her desires, and the idea that
she could and should have a separate life of her own seemed to him so alarming
that he made haste to dispel it. It was the chasm which he was afraid to peep
into. To put himself in thought and feeling in another person’s place was
a spiritual exercise not natural to Alexey Alexandrovitch. He looked on this
spiritual exercise as a harmful and dangerous abuse of the fancy.
“And the worst of it all,” thought he, “is that just now, at
the very moment when my great work is approaching completion” (he was
thinking of the project he was bringing forward at the time), “when I
stand in need of all my mental peace and all my energies, just now this stupid
worry should fall foul of me. But what’s to be done? I’m not one of
those men who submit to uneasiness and worry without having the force of
character to face them.
“I must think it over, come to a decision, and put it out of my
mind,” he said aloud.
“The question of her feelings, of what has passed and may be passing in
her soul, that’s not my affair; that’s the affair of her
conscience, and falls under the head of religion,” he said to himself,
feeling consolation in the sense that he had found to which division of
regulating principles this new circumstance could be properly referred.
“And so,” Alexey Alexandrovitch said to himself, “questions
as to her feelings, and so on, are questions for her conscience, with which I
can have nothing to do. My duty is clearly defined. As the head of the family,
I am a person bound in duty to guide her, and consequently, in part the person
responsible; I am bound to point out the danger I perceive, to warn her, even
to use my authority. I ought to speak plainly to her.” And everything
that he would say tonight to his wife took clear shape in Alexey
Alexandrovitch’s head. Thinking over what he would say, he somewhat
regretted that he should have to use his time and mental powers for domestic
consumption, with so little to show for it, but, in spite of that, the form and
contents of the speech before him shaped itself as clearly and distinctly in
his head as a ministerial report.
“I must say and express fully the following points: first, exposition of
the value to be attached to public opinion and to decorum; secondly, exposition
of religious significance of marriage; thirdly, if need be, reference to the
calamity possibly ensuing to our son; fourthly, reference to the unhappiness
likely to result to herself.” And, interlacing his fingers, Alexey
Alexandrovitch stretched them, and the joints of the fingers cracked. This
trick, a bad habit, the cracking of his fingers, always soothed him, and gave
precision to his thoughts, so needful to him at this juncture.
There was the sound of a carriage driving up to the front door. Alexey
Alexandrovitch halted in the middle of the room.
A woman’s step was heard mounting the stairs. Alexey Alexandrovitch,
ready for his speech, stood compressing his crossed fingers, waiting to see if
the crack would not come again. One joint cracked.
Already, from the sound of light steps on the stairs, he was aware that she was
close, and though he was satisfied with his speech, he felt frightened of the
explanation confronting him....
Anna came in with hanging head, playing with the tassels of her hood. Her face
was brilliant and glowing; but this glow was not one of brightness; it
suggested the fearful glow of a conflagration in the midst of a dark night. On
seeing her husband, Anna raised her head and smiled, as though she had just
waked up.
“You’re not in bed? What a wonder!” she said, letting fall
her hood, and without stopping, she went on into the dressing-room.
“It’s late, Alexey Alexandrovitch,” she said, when she had
gone through the doorway.
“Anna, it’s necessary for me to have a talk with you.”
“With me?” she said, wonderingly. She came out from behind the door
of the dressing-room, and looked at him. “Why, what is it? What
about?” she asked, sitting down. “Well, let’s talk, if
it’s so necessary. But it would be better to get to sleep.”
Anna said what came to her lips, and marveled, hearing herself, at her own
capacity for lying. How simple and natural were her words, and how likely that
she was simply sleepy! She felt herself clad in an impenetrable armor of
falsehood. She felt that some unseen force had come to her aid and was
supporting her.
“Anna, I must warn you,” he began.
“Warn me?” she said. “Of what?”
She looked at him so simply, so brightly, that anyone who did not know her as
her husband knew her could not have noticed anything unnatural, either in the
sound or the sense of her words. But to him, knowing her, knowing that whenever
he went to bed five minutes later than usual, she noticed it, and asked him the
reason; to him, knowing that every joy, every pleasure and pain that she felt
she communicated to him at once; to him, now to see that she did not care to
notice his state of mind, that she did not care to say a word about herself,
meant a great deal. He saw that the inmost recesses of her soul, that had
always hitherto lain open before him, were closed against him. More than that,
he saw from her tone that she was not even perturbed at that, but as it were
said straight out to him: “Yes, it’s shut up, and so it must be,
and will be in future.” Now he experienced a feeling such as a man might
have, returning home and finding his own house locked up. “But perhaps
the key may yet be found,” thought Alexey Alexandrovitch.
“I want to warn you,” he said in a low voice, “that through
thoughtlessness and lack of caution you may cause yourself to be talked about
in society. Your too animated conversation this evening with Count
Vronsky” (he enunciated the name firmly and with deliberate emphasis)
“attracted attention.”
He talked and looked at her laughing eyes, which frightened him now with their
impenetrable look, and, as he talked, he felt all the uselessness and idleness
of his words.
“You’re always like that,” she answered, as though completely
misapprehending him, and of all he had said only taking in the last phrase.
“One time you don’t like my being dull, and another time you
don’t like my being lively. I wasn’t dull. Does that offend
you?”
Alexey Alexandrovitch shivered, and bent his hands to make the joints crack.
“Oh, please, don’t do that, I do so dislike it,” she said.
“Anna, is this you?” said Alexey Alexandrovitch, quietly making an
effort over himself, and restraining the motion of his fingers.
“But what is it all about?” she said, with such genuine and droll
wonder. “What do you want of me?”
Alexey Alexandrovitch paused, and rubbed his forehead and his eyes. He saw that
instead of doing as he had intended—that is to say, warning his wife
against a mistake in the eyes of the world—he had unconsciously become
agitated over what was the affair of her conscience, and was struggling against
the barrier he fancied between them.
“This is what I meant to say to you,” he went on coldly and
composedly, “and I beg you to listen to it. I consider jealousy, as you
know, a humiliating and degrading feeling, and I shall never allow myself to be
influenced by it; but there are certain rules of decorum which cannot be
disregarded with impunity. This evening it was not I observed it, but judging
by the impression made on the company, everyone observed that your conduct and
deportment were not altogether what could be desired.”
“I positively don’t understand,” said Anna, shrugging her
shoulders—“He doesn’t care,” she thought. “But
other people noticed it, and that’s what upsets
him.”—“You’re not well, Alexey Alexandrovitch,”
she added, and she got up, and would have gone towards the door; but he moved
forward as though he would stop her.
His face was ugly and forbidding, as Anna had never seen him. She stopped, and
bending her head back and on one side, began with her rapid hand taking out her
hairpins.
“Well, I’m listening to what’s to come,” she said,
calmly and ironically; “and indeed I listen with interest, for I should
like to understand what’s the matter.”
She spoke, and marveled at the confident, calm, and natural tone in which she
was speaking, and the choice of the words she used.
“To enter into all the details of your feelings I have no right, and
besides, I regard that as useless and even harmful,” began Alexey
Alexandrovitch. “Ferreting in one’s soul, one often ferrets out
something that might have lain there unnoticed. Your feelings are an affair of
your own conscience; but I am in duty bound to you, to myself, and to God, to
point out to you your duties. Our life has been joined, not by man, but by God.
That union can only be severed by a crime, and a crime of that nature brings
its own chastisement.”
“I don’t understand a word. And, oh dear! how sleepy I am,
unluckily,” she said, rapidly passing her hand through her hair, feeling
for the remaining hairpins.
“Anna, for God’s sake don’t speak like that!” he said
gently. “Perhaps I am mistaken, but believe me, what I say, I say as much
for myself as for you. I am your husband, and I love you.”
For an instant her face fell, and the mocking gleam in her eyes died away; but
the word love threw her into revolt again. She thought: “Love? Can
he love? If he hadn’t heard there was such a thing as love, he would
never have used the word. He doesn’t even know what love is.”
“Alexey Alexandrovitch, really I don’t understand,” she said.
“Define what it is you find....”
“Pardon, let me say all I have to say. I love you. But I am not speaking
of myself; the most important persons in this matter are our son and yourself.
It may very well be, I repeat, that my words seem to you utterly unnecessary
and out of place; it may be that they are called forth by my mistaken
impression. In that case, I beg you to forgive me. But if you are conscious
yourself of even the smallest foundation for them, then I beg you to think a
little, and if your heart prompts you, to speak out to me....”
Alexey Alexandrovitch was unconsciously saying something utterly unlike what he
had prepared.
“I have nothing to say. And besides,” she said hurriedly, with
difficulty repressing a smile, “it’s really time to be in
bed.”
Alexey Alexandrovitch sighed, and, without saying more, went into the bedroom.
When she came into the bedroom, he was already in bed. His lips were sternly
compressed, and his eyes looked away from her. Anna got into her bed, and lay
expecting every minute that he would begin to speak to her again. She both
feared his speaking and wished for it. But he was silent. She waited for a long
while without moving, and had forgotten about him. She thought of that other;
she pictured him, and felt how her heart was flooded with emotion and guilty
delight at the thought of him. Suddenly she heard an even, tranquil snore. For
the first instant Alexey Alexandrovitch seemed, as it were, appalled at his own
snoring, and ceased; but after an interval of two breathings the snore sounded
again, with a new tranquil rhythm.
“It’s late, it’s late,” she whispered with a smile. A
long while she lay, not moving, with open eyes, whose brilliance she almost
fancied she could herself see in the darkness.
From that time a new life began for Alexey Alexandrovitch and for his wife.
Nothing special happened. Anna went out into society, as she had always done,
was particularly often at Princess Betsy’s, and met Vronsky everywhere.
Alexey Alexandrovitch saw this, but could do nothing. All his efforts to draw
her into open discussion she confronted with a barrier which he could not
penetrate, made up of a sort of amused perplexity. Outwardly everything was the
same, but their inner relations were completely changed. Alexey Alexandrovitch,
a man of great power in the world of politics, felt himself helpless in this.
Like an ox with head bent, submissively he awaited the blow which he felt was
lifted over him. Every time he began to think about it, he felt that he must
try once more, that by kindness, tenderness, and persuasion there was still
hope of saving her, of bringing her back to herself, and every day he made
ready to talk to her. But every time he began talking to her, he felt that the
spirit of evil and deceit, which had taken possession of her, had possession of
him too, and he talked to her in a tone quite unlike that in which he had meant
to talk. Involuntarily he talked to her in his habitual tone of jeering at
anyone who should say what he was saying. And in that tone it was impossible to
say what needed to be said to her.
That which for Vronsky had been almost a whole year the one absorbing desire of
his life, replacing all his old desires; that which for Anna had been an
impossible, terrible, and even for that reason more entrancing dream of bliss,
that desire had been fulfilled. He stood before her, pale, his lower jaw
quivering, and besought her to be calm, not knowing how or why.
“Anna! Anna!” he said with a choking voice, “Anna, for
pity’s sake!...”
But the louder he spoke, the lower she dropped her once proud and gay, now
shame-stricken head, and she bowed down and sank from the sofa where she was
sitting, down on the floor, at his feet; she would have fallen on the carpet if
he had not held her.
“My God! Forgive me!” she said, sobbing, pressing his hands to her
bosom.
She felt so sinful, so guilty, that nothing was left her but to humiliate
herself and beg forgiveness; and as now there was no one in her life but him,
to him she addressed her prayer for forgiveness. Looking at him, she had a
physical sense of her humiliation, and she could say nothing more. He felt what
a murderer must feel, when he sees the body he has robbed of life. That body,
robbed by him of life, was their love, the first stage of their love. There was
something awful and revolting in the memory of what had been bought at this
fearful price of shame. Shame at their spiritual nakedness crushed her and
infected him. But in spite of all the murderer’s horror before the body
of his victim, he must hack it to pieces, hide the body, must use what he has
gained by his murder.
And with fury, as it were with passion, the murderer falls on the body, and
drags it and hacks at it; so he covered her face and shoulders with kisses. She
held his hand, and did not stir. “Yes, these kisses—that is what
has been bought by this shame. Yes, and one hand, which will always be
mine—the hand of my accomplice.” She lifted up that hand and kissed
it. He sank on his knees and tried to see her face; but she hid it, and said
nothing. At last, as though making an effort over herself, she got up and
pushed him away. Her face was still as beautiful, but it was only the more
pitiful for that.
“All is over,” she said; “I have nothing but you. Remember
that.”
“I can never forget what is my whole life. For one instant of this
happiness....”
“Happiness!” she said with horror and loathing and her horror
unconsciously infected him. “For pity’s sake, not a word, not a
word more.”
She rose quickly and moved away from him.
“Not a word more,” she repeated, and with a look of chill despair,
incomprehensible to him, she parted from him. She felt that at that moment she
could not put into words the sense of shame, of rapture, and of horror at this
stepping into a new life, and she did not want to speak of it, to vulgarize
this feeling by inappropriate words. But later too, and the next day and the
third day, she still found no words in which she could express the complexity
of her feelings; indeed, she could not even find thoughts in which she could
clearly think out all that was in her soul.
She said to herself: “No, just now I can’t think of it, later on,
when I am calmer.” But this calm for thought never came; every time the
thought rose of what she had done and what would happen to her, and what she
ought to do, a horror came over her and she drove those thoughts away.
“Later, later,” she said—“when I am calmer.”
But in dreams, when she had no control over her thoughts, her position
presented itself to her in all its hideous nakedness. One dream haunted her
almost every night. She dreamed that both were her husbands at once, that both
were lavishing caresses on her. Alexey Alexandrovitch was weeping, kissing her
hands, and saying, “How happy we are now!” And Alexey Vronsky was
there too, and he too was her husband. And she was marveling that it had once
seemed impossible to her, was explaining to them, laughing, that this was ever
so much simpler, and that now both of them were happy and contented. But this
dream weighed on her like a nightmare, and she awoke from it in terror.
In the early days after his return from Moscow, whenever Levin shuddered and
grew red, remembering the disgrace of his rejection, he said to himself:
“This was just how I used to shudder and blush, thinking myself utterly
lost, when I was plucked in physics and did not get my remove; and how I
thought myself utterly ruined after I had mismanaged that affair of my
sister’s that was entrusted to me. And yet, now that years have passed, I
recall it and wonder that it could distress me so much. It will be the same
thing too with this trouble. Time will go by and I shall not mind about this
either.”
But three months had passed and he had not left off minding about it; and it
was as painful for him to think of it as it had been those first days. He could
not be at peace because after dreaming so long of family life, and feeling
himself so ripe for it, he was still not married, and was further than ever
from marriage. He was painfully conscious himself, as were all about him, that
at his years it is not well for man to be alone. He remembered how before
starting for Moscow he had once said to his cowman Nikolay, a simple-hearted
peasant, whom he liked talking to: “Well, Nikolay! I mean to get
married,” and how Nikolay had promptly answered, as of a matter on which
there could be no possible doubt: “And high time too, Konstantin
Dmitrievitch.” But marriage had now become further off than ever. The
place was taken, and whenever he tried to imagine any of the girls he knew in
that place, he felt that it was utterly impossible. Moreover, the recollection
of the rejection and the part he had played in the affair tortured him with
shame. However often he told himself that he was in no wise to blame in it,
that recollection, like other humiliating reminiscences of a similar kind, made
him twinge and blush. There had been in his past, as in every man’s,
actions, recognized by him as bad, for which his conscience ought to have
tormented him; but the memory of these evil actions was far from causing him so
much suffering as those trivial but humiliating reminiscences. These wounds
never healed. And with these memories was now ranged his rejection and the
pitiful position in which he must have appeared to others that evening. But
time and work did their part. Bitter memories were more and more covered up by
the incidents—paltry in his eyes, but really important—of his
country life. Every week he thought less often of Kitty. He was impatiently
looking forward to the news that she was married, or just going to be married,
hoping that such news would, like having a tooth out, completely cure him.
Meanwhile spring came on, beautiful and kindly, without the delays and
treacheries of spring,—one of those rare springs in which plants, beasts,
and man rejoice alike. This lovely spring roused Levin still more, and
strengthened him in his resolution of renouncing all his past and building up
his lonely life firmly and independently. Though many of the plans with which
he had returned to the country had not been carried out, still his most
important resolution—that of purity—had been kept by him. He was
free from that shame, which had usually harassed him after a fall; and he could
look everyone straight in the face. In February he had received a letter from
Marya Nikolaevna telling him that his brother Nikolay’s health was
getting worse, but that he would not take advice, and in consequence of this
letter Levin went to Moscow to his brother’s and succeeded in persuading
him to see a doctor and to go to a watering-place abroad. He succeeded so well
in persuading his brother, and in lending him money for the journey without
irritating him, that he was satisfied with himself in that matter. In addition
to his farming, which called for special attention in spring, and in addition
to reading, Levin had begun that winter a work on agriculture, the plan of
which turned on taking into account the character of the laborer on the land as
one of the unalterable data of the question, like the climate and the soil, and
consequently deducing all the principles of scientific culture, not simply from
the data of soil and climate, but from the data of soil, climate, and a certain
unalterable character of the laborer. Thus, in spite of his solitude, or in
consequence of his solitude, his life was exceedingly full. Only rarely he
suffered from an unsatisfied desire to communicate his stray ideas to someone
besides Agafea Mihalovna. With her indeed he not infrequently fell into
discussion upon physics, the theory of agriculture, and especially philosophy;
philosophy was Agafea Mihalovna’s favorite subject.
Spring was slow in unfolding. For the last few weeks it had been steadily fine
frosty weather. In the daytime it thawed in the sun, but at night there were
even seven degrees of frost. There was such a frozen surface on the snow that
they drove the wagons anywhere off the roads. Easter came in the snow. Then all
of a sudden, on Easter Monday, a warm wind sprang up, storm clouds swooped
down, and for three days and three nights the warm, driving rain fell in
streams. On Thursday the wind dropped, and a thick gray fog brooded over the
land as though hiding the mysteries of the transformations that were being
wrought in nature. Behind the fog there was the flowing of water, the cracking
and floating of ice, the swift rush of turbid, foaming torrents; and on the
following Monday, in the evening, the fog parted, the storm clouds split up
into little curling crests of cloud, the sky cleared, and the real spring had
come. In the morning the sun rose brilliant and quickly wore away the thin
layer of ice that covered the water, and all the warm air was quivering with
the steam that rose up from the quickened earth. The old grass looked greener,
and the young grass thrust up its tiny blades; the buds of the guelder-rose and
of the currant and the sticky birch-buds were swollen with sap, and an
exploring bee was humming about the golden blossoms that studded the willow.
Larks trilled unseen above the velvety green fields and the ice-covered
stubble-land; peewits wailed over the low lands and marshes flooded by the
pools; cranes and wild geese flew high across the sky uttering their spring
calls. The cattle, bald in patches where the new hair had not grown yet, lowed
in the pastures; the bowlegged lambs frisked round their bleating mothers.
Nimble children ran about the drying paths, covered with the prints of bare
feet. There was a merry chatter of peasant women over their linen at the pond,
and the ring of axes in the yard, where the peasants were repairing ploughs and
harrows. The real spring had come.
Levin put on his big boots, and, for the first time, a cloth jacket, instead of
his fur cloak, and went out to look after his farm, stepping over streams of
water that flashed in the sunshine and dazzled his eyes, and treading one
minute on ice and the next into sticky mud.
Spring is the time of plans and projects. And, as he came out into the
farmyard, Levin, like a tree in spring that knows not what form will be taken
by the young shoots and twigs imprisoned in its swelling buds, hardly knew what
undertakings he was going to begin upon now in the farm work that was so dear
to him. But he felt that he was full of the most splendid plans and projects.
First of all he went to the cattle. The cows had been let out into their
paddock, and their smooth sides were already shining with their new, sleek,
spring coats; they basked in the sunshine and lowed to go to the meadow. Levin
gazed admiringly at the cows he knew so intimately to the minutest detail of
their condition, and gave orders for them to be driven out into the meadow, and
the calves to be let into the paddock. The herdsman ran gaily to get ready for
the meadow. The cowherd girls, picking up their petticoats, ran splashing
through the mud with bare legs, still white, not yet brown from the sun, waving
brush wood in their hands, chasing the calves that frolicked in the mirth of
spring.
After admiring the young ones of that year, who were particularly
fine—the early calves were the size of a peasant’s cow, and
Pava’s daughter, at three months old, was as big as a
yearling—Levin gave orders for a trough to be brought out and for them to
be fed in the paddock. But it appeared that as the paddock had not been used
during the winter, the hurdles made in the autumn for it were broken. He sent
for the carpenter, who, according to his orders, ought to have been at work at
the thrashing machine. But it appeared that the carpenter was repairing the
harrows, which ought to have been repaired before Lent. This was very annoying
to Levin. It was annoying to come upon that everlasting slovenliness in the
farm work against which he had been striving with all his might for so many
years. The hurdles, as he ascertained, being not wanted in winter, had been
carried to the cart-horses’ stable; and there broken, as they were of
light construction, only meant for feeding calves. Moreover, it was apparent
also that the harrows and all the agricultural implements, which he had
directed to be looked over and repaired in the winter, for which very purpose
he had hired three carpenters, had not been put into repair, and the harrows
were being repaired when they ought to have been harrowing the field. Levin
sent for his bailiff, but immediately went off himself to look for him. The
bailiff, beaming all over, like everyone that day, in a sheepskin bordered with
astrachan, came out of the barn, twisting a bit of straw in his hands.
“Why isn’t the carpenter at the thrashing machine?”
“Oh, I meant to tell you yesterday, the harrows want repairing. Here
it’s time they got to work in the fields.”
“But what were they doing in the winter, then?”
“But what did you want the carpenter for?”
“Where are the hurdles for the calves’ paddock?”
“I ordered them to be got ready. What would you have with those
peasants!” said the bailiff, with a wave of his hand.
“It’s not those peasants but this bailiff!” said Levin,
getting angry. “Why, what do I keep you for?” he cried. But,
bethinking himself that this would not help matters, he stopped short in the
middle of a sentence, and merely sighed. “Well, what do you say? Can
sowing begin?” he asked, after a pause.
“Behind Turkin tomorrow or the next day they might begin.”
“And the clover?”
“I’ve sent Vassily and Mishka; they’re sowing. Only I
don’t know if they’ll manage to get through; it’s so
slushy.”
“How many acres?”
“About fifteen.”
“Why not sow all?” cried Levin.
That they were only sowing the clover on fifteen acres, not on all the
forty-five, was still more annoying to him. Clover, as he knew, both from books
and from his own experience, never did well except when it was sown as early as
possible, almost in the snow. And yet Levin could never get this done.
“There’s no one to send. What would you have with such a set of
peasants? Three haven’t turned up. And there’s Semyon....”
“Well, you should have taken some men from the thatching.”
“And so I have, as it is.”
“Where are the peasants, then?”
“Five are making compôte” (which meant compost), “four are
shifting the oats for fear of a touch of mildew, Konstantin
Dmitrievitch.”
Levin knew very well that “a touch of mildew” meant that his
English seed oats were already ruined. Again they had not done as he had
ordered.
“Why, but I told you during Lent to put in pipes,” he cried.
“Don’t put yourself out; we shall get it all done in time.”
Levin waved his hand angrily, went into the granary to glance at the oats, and
then to the stable. The oats were not yet spoiled. But the peasants were
carrying the oats in spades when they might simply let them slide down into the
lower granary; and arranging for this to be done, and taking two workmen from
there for sowing clover, Levin got over his vexation with the bailiff. Indeed,
it was such a lovely day that one could not be angry.
“Ignat!” he called to the coachman, who, with his sleeves tucked
up, was washing the carriage wheels, “saddle me....”
“Which, sir?”
“Well, let it be Kolpik.”
“Yes, sir.”
While they were saddling his horse, Levin again called up the bailiff, who was
hanging about in sight, to make it up with him, and began talking to him about
the spring operations before them, and his plans for the farm.
The wagons were to begin carting manure earlier, so as to get all done before
the early mowing. And the ploughing of the further land to go on without a
break so as to let it ripen lying fallow. And the mowing to be all done by
hired labor, not on half-profits. The bailiff listened attentively, and
obviously made an effort to approve of his employer’s projects. But still
he had that look Levin knew so well that always irritated him, a look of
hopelessness and despondency. That look said: “That’s all very
well, but as God wills.”
Nothing mortified Levin so much as that tone. But it was the tone common to all
the bailiffs he had ever had. They had all taken up that attitude to his plans,
and so now he was not angered by it, but mortified, and felt all the more
roused to struggle against this, as it seemed, elemental force continually
ranged against him, for which he could find no other expression than “as
God wills.”
“If we can manage it, Konstantin Dmitrievitch,” said the bailiff.
“Why ever shouldn’t you manage it?”
“We positively must have another fifteen laborers. And they don’t
turn up. There were some here today asking seventy roubles for the
summer.”
Levin was silent. Again he was brought face to face with that opposing force.
He knew that however much they tried, they could not hire more than
forty—thirty-seven perhaps or thirty-eight—laborers for a
reasonable sum. Some forty had been taken on, and there were no more. But still
he could not help struggling against it.
“Send to Sury, to Tchefirovka; if they don’t come we must look for
them.”
“Oh, I’ll send, to be sure,” said Vassily Fedorovitch
despondently. “But there are the horses, too, they’re not good for
much.”
“We’ll get some more. I know, of course,” Levin added
laughing, “you always want to do with as little and as poor quality as
possible; but this year I’m not going to let you have things your own
way. I’ll see to everything myself.”
“Why, I don’t think you take much rest as it is. It cheers us up to
work under the master’s eye....”
“So they’re sowing clover behind the Birch Dale? I’ll go and
have a look at them,” he said, getting on to the little bay cob, Kolpik,
who was led up by the coachman.
“You can’t get across the streams, Konstantin Dmitrievitch,”
the coachman shouted.
“All right, I’ll go by the forest.”
And Levin rode through the slush of the farmyard to the gate and out into the
open country, his good little horse, after his long inactivity, stepping out
gallantly, snorting over the pools, and asking, as it were, for guidance. If
Levin had felt happy before in the cattle pens and farmyard, he felt happier
yet in the open country. Swaying rhythmically with the ambling paces of his
good little cob, drinking in the warm yet fresh scent of the snow and the air,
as he rode through his forest over the crumbling, wasted snow, still left in
parts, and covered with dissolving tracks, he rejoiced over every tree, with
the moss reviving on its bark and the buds swelling on its shoots. When he came
out of the forest, in the immense plain before him, his grass fields stretched
in an unbroken carpet of green, without one bare place or swamp, only spotted
here and there in the hollows with patches of melting snow. He was not put out
of temper even by the sight of the peasants’ horses and colts trampling
down his young grass (he told a peasant he met to drive them out), nor by the
sarcastic and stupid reply of the peasant Ipat, whom he met on the way, and
asked, “Well, Ipat, shall we soon be sowing?” “We must get
the ploughing done first, Konstantin Dmitrievitch,” answered Ipat. The
further he rode, the happier he became, and plans for the land rose to his mind
each better than the last; to plant all his fields with hedges along the
southern borders, so that the snow should not lie under them; to divide them up
into six fields of arable and three of pasture and hay; to build a cattle yard
at the further end of the estate, and to dig a pond and to construct movable
pens for the cattle as a means of manuring the land. And then eight hundred
acres of wheat, three hundred of potatoes, and four hundred of clover, and not
one acre exhausted.
Absorbed in such dreams, carefully keeping his horse by the hedges, so as not
to trample his young crops, he rode up to the laborers who had been sent to sow
clover. A cart with the seed in it was standing, not at the edge, but in the
middle of the crop, and the winter corn had been torn up by the wheels and
trampled by the horse. Both the laborers were sitting in the hedge, probably
smoking a pipe together. The earth in the cart, with which the seed was mixed,
was not crushed to powder, but crusted together or adhering in clods. Seeing
the master, the laborer, Vassily, went towards the cart, while Mishka set to
work sowing. This was not as it should be, but with the laborers Levin seldom
lost his temper. When Vassily came up, Levin told him to lead the horse to the
hedge.
“It’s all right, sir, it’ll spring up again,” responded
Vassily.
“Please don’t argue,” said Levin, “but do as
you’re told.”
“Yes, sir,” answered Vassily, and he took the horse’s head.
“What a sowing, Konstantin Dmitrievitch,” he said, hesitating;
“first rate. Only it’s a work to get about! You drag a ton of earth
on your shoes.”
“Why is it you have earth that’s not sifted?” said Levin.
“Well, we crumble it up,” answered Vassily, taking up some seed and
rolling the earth in his palms.
Vassily was not to blame for their having filled up his cart with unsifted
earth, but still it was annoying.
Levin had more than once already tried a way he knew for stifling his anger,
and turning all that seemed dark right again, and he tried that way now. He
watched how Mishka strode along, swinging the huge clods of earth that clung to
each foot; and getting off his horse, he took the sieve from Vassily and
started sowing himself.
“Where did you stop?”
Vassily pointed to the mark with his foot, and Levin went forward as best he
could, scattering the seed on the land. Walking was as difficult as on a bog,
and by the time Levin had ended the row he was in a great heat, and he stopped
and gave up the sieve to Vassily.
“Well, master, when summer’s here, mind you don’t scold me
for these rows,” said Vassily.
“Eh?” said Levin cheerily, already feeling the effect of his
method.
“Why, you’ll see in the summer time. It’ll look different.
Look you where I sowed last spring. How I did work at it! I do my best,
Konstantin Dmitrievitch, d’ye see, as I would for my own father. I
don’t like bad work myself, nor would I let another man do it.
What’s good for the master’s good for us too. To look out yonder
now,” said Vassily, pointing, “it does one’s heart
good.”
“It’s a lovely spring, Vassily.”
“Why, it’s a spring such as the old men don’t remember the
like of. I was up home; an old man up there has sown wheat too, about an acre
of it. He was saying you wouldn’t know it from rye.”
“Have you been sowing wheat long?”
“Why, sir, it was you taught us the year before last. You gave me two
measures. We sold about eight bushels and sowed a rood.”
“Well, mind you crumble up the clods,” said Levin, going towards
his horse, “and keep an eye on Mishka. And if there’s a good crop
you shall have half a rouble for every acre.”
“Humbly thankful. We are very well content, sir, as it is.”
Levin got on his horse and rode towards the field where was last year’s
clover, and the one which was ploughed ready for the spring corn.
The crop of clover coming up in the stubble was magnificent. It had survived
everything, and stood up vividly green through the broken stalks of last
year’s wheat. The horse sank in up to the pasterns, and he drew each hoof
with a sucking sound out of the half-thawed ground. Over the ploughland riding
was utterly impossible; the horse could only keep a foothold where there was
ice, and in the thawing furrows he sank deep in at each step. The ploughland
was in splendid condition; in a couple of days it would be fit for harrowing
and sowing. Everything was capital, everything was cheering. Levin rode back
across the streams, hoping the water would have gone down. And he did in fact
get across, and startled two ducks. “There must be snipe too,” he
thought, and just as he reached the turning homewards he met the forest keeper,
who confirmed his theory about the snipe.
Levin went home at a trot, so as to have time to eat his dinner and get his gun
ready for the evening.
As he rode up to the house in the happiest frame of mind, Levin heard the bell
ring at the side of the principal entrance of the house.
“Yes, that’s someone from the railway station,” he thought,
“just the time to be here from the Moscow train ... Who could it be? What
if it’s brother Nikolay? He did say: ‘Maybe I’ll go to the
waters, or maybe I’ll come down to you.’” He felt dismayed
and vexed for the first minute, that his brother Nikolay’s presence
should come to disturb his happy mood of spring. But he felt ashamed of the
feeling, and at once he opened, as it were, the arms of his soul, and with a
softened feeling of joy and expectation, now he hoped with all his heart that
it was his brother. He pricked up his horse, and riding out from behind the
acacias he saw a hired three-horse sledge from the railway station, and a
gentleman in a fur coat. It was not his brother. “Oh, if it were only
some nice person one could talk to a little!” he thought.
“Ah,” cried Levin joyfully, flinging up both his hands.
“Here’s a delightful visitor! Ah, how glad I am to see you!”
he shouted, recognizing Stepan Arkadyevitch.
“I shall find out for certain whether she’s married, or when
she’s going to be married,” he thought. And on that delicious
spring day he felt that the thought of her did not hurt him at all.
“Well, you didn’t expect me, eh?” said Stepan Arkadyevitch,
getting out of the sledge, splashed with mud on the bridge of his nose, on his
cheek, and on his eyebrows, but radiant with health and good spirits.
“I’ve come to see you in the first place,” he said, embracing
and kissing him, “to have some stand-shooting second, and to sell the
forest at Ergushovo third.”
“Delightful! What a spring we’re having! How ever did you get along
in a sledge?”
“In a cart it would have been worse still, Konstantin
Dmitrievitch,” answered the driver, who knew him.
“Well, I’m very, very glad to see you,” said Levin, with a
genuine smile of childlike delight.
Levin led his friend to the room set apart for visitors, where Stepan
Arkadyevitch’s things were carried also—a bag, a gun in a case, a
satchel for cigars. Leaving him there to wash and change his clothes, Levin
went off to the counting house to speak about the ploughing and clover. Agafea
Mihalovna, always very anxious for the credit of the house, met him in the hall
with inquiries about dinner.
“Do just as you like, only let it be as soon as possible,” he said,
and went to the bailiff.
When he came back, Stepan Arkadyevitch, washed and combed, came out of his room
with a beaming smile, and they went upstairs together.
“Well, I am glad I managed to get away to you! Now I shall understand
what the mysterious business is that you are always absorbed in here. No,
really, I envy you. What a house, how nice it all is! So bright, so
cheerful!” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, forgetting that it was not always
spring and fine weather like that day. “And your nurse is simply
charming! A pretty maid in an apron might be even more agreeable, perhaps; but
for your severe monastic style it does very well.”
Stepan Arkadyevitch told him many interesting pieces of news; especially
interesting to Levin was the news that his brother, Sergey Ivanovitch, was
intending to pay him a visit in the summer.
Not one word did Stepan Arkadyevitch say in reference to Kitty and the
Shtcherbatskys; he merely gave him greetings from his wife. Levin was grateful
to him for his delicacy and was very glad of his visitor. As always happened
with him during his solitude, a mass of ideas and feelings had been
accumulating within him, which he could not communicate to those about him. And
now he poured out upon Stepan Arkadyevitch his poetic joy in the spring, and
his failures and plans for the land, and his thoughts and criticisms on the
books he had been reading, and the idea of his own book, the basis of which
really was, though he was unaware of it himself, a criticism of all the old
books on agriculture. Stepan Arkadyevitch, always charming, understanding
everything at the slightest reference, was particularly charming on this visit,
and Levin noticed in him a special tenderness, as it were, and a new tone of
respect that flattered him.
The efforts of Agafea Mihalovna and the cook, that the dinner should be
particularly good, only ended in the two famished friends attacking the
preliminary course, eating a great deal of bread and butter, salt goose and
salted mushrooms, and in Levin’s finally ordering the soup to be served
without the accompaniment of little pies, with which the cook had particularly
meant to impress their visitor. But though Stepan Arkadyevitch was accustomed
to very different dinners, he thought everything excellent: the herb brandy,
and the bread, and the butter, and above all the salt goose and the mushrooms,
and the nettle soup, and the chicken in white sauce, and the white Crimean
wine—everything was superb and delicious.
“Splendid, splendid!” he said, lighting a fat cigar after the
roast. “I feel as if, coming to you, I had landed on a peaceful shore
after the noise and jolting of a steamer. And so you maintain that the laborer
himself is an element to be studied and to regulate the choice of methods in
agriculture. Of course, I’m an ignorant outsider; but I should fancy
theory and its application will have its influence on the laborer too.”
“Yes, but wait a bit. I’m not talking of political economy,
I’m talking of the science of agriculture. It ought to be like the
natural sciences, and to observe given phenomena and the laborer in his
economic, ethnographical....”
At that instant Agafea Mihalovna came in with jam.
“Oh, Agafea Mihalovna,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, kissing the tips
of his plump fingers, “what salt goose, what herb brandy!... What do you
think, isn’t it time to start, Kostya?” he added.
Levin looked out of the window at the sun sinking behind the bare tree-tops of
the forest.
“Yes, it’s time,” he said. “Kouzma, get ready the
trap,” and he ran downstairs.
Stepan Arkadyevitch, going down, carefully took the canvas cover off his
varnished gun case with his own hands, and opening it, began to get ready his
expensive new-fashioned gun. Kouzma, who already scented a big tip, never left
Stepan Arkadyevitch’s side, and put on him both his stockings and boots,
a task which Stepan Arkadyevitch readily left him.
“Kostya, give orders that if the merchant Ryabinin comes ... I told him
to come today, he’s to be brought in and to wait for me....”
“Why, do you mean to say you’re selling the forest to
Ryabinin?”
“Yes. Do you know him?”
“To be sure I do. I have had to do business with him, ‘positively
and conclusively.’”
Stepan Arkadyevitch laughed. “Positively and conclusively” were the
merchant’s favorite words.
“Yes, it’s wonderfully funny the way he talks. She knows where her
master’s going!” he added, patting Laska, who hung about Levin,
whining and licking his hands, his boots, and his gun.
The trap was already at the steps when they went out.
“I told them to bring the trap round; or would you rather walk?”
“No, we’d better drive,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, getting
into the trap. He sat down, tucked the tiger-skin rug round him, and lighted a
cigar. “How is it you don’t smoke? A cigar is a sort of thing, not
exactly a pleasure, but the crown and outward sign of pleasure. Come, this is
life! How splendid it is! This is how I should like to live!”
“Why, who prevents you?” said Levin, smiling.
“No, you’re a lucky man! You’ve got everything you like. You
like horses—and you have them; dogs—you have them;
shooting—you have it; farming—you have it.”
“Perhaps because I rejoice in what I have, and don’t fret for what
I haven’t,” said Levin, thinking of Kitty.
Stepan Arkadyevitch comprehended, looked at him, but said nothing.
Levin was grateful to Oblonsky for noticing, with his never-failing tact, that
he dreaded conversation about the Shtcherbatskys, and so saying nothing about
them. But now Levin was longing to find out what was tormenting him so, yet he
had not the courage to begin.
“Come, tell me how things are going with you,” said Levin,
bethinking himself that it was not nice of him to think only of himself.
Stepan Arkadyevitch’s eyes sparkled merrily.
“You don’t admit, I know, that one can be fond of new rolls when
one has had one’s rations of bread—to your mind it’s a crime;
but I don’t count life as life without love,” he said, taking
Levin’s question his own way. “What am I to do? I’m made that
way. And really, one does so little harm to anyone, and gives oneself so much
pleasure....”
“What! is there something new, then?” queried Levin.
“Yes, my boy, there is! There, do you see, you know the type of
Ossian’s women.... Women, such as one sees in dreams.... Well, these
women are sometimes to be met in reality ... and these women are terrible.
Woman, don’t you know, is such a subject that however much you study it,
it’s always perfectly new.”
“Well, then, it would be better not to study it.”
“No. Some mathematician has said that enjoyment lies in the search for
truth, not in the finding it.”
Levin listened in silence, and in spite of all the efforts he made, he could
not in the least enter into the feelings of his friend and understand his
sentiments and the charm of studying such women.
The place fixed on for the stand-shooting was not far above a stream in a
little aspen copse. On reaching the copse, Levin got out of the trap and led
Oblonsky to a corner of a mossy, swampy glade, already quite free from snow. He
went back himself to a double birch tree on the other side, and leaning his gun
on the fork of a dead lower branch, he took off his full overcoat, fastened his
belt again, and worked his arms to see if they were free.
Gray old Laska, who had followed them, sat down warily opposite him and pricked
up her ears. The sun was setting behind a thick forest, and in the glow of
sunset the birch trees, dotted about in the aspen copse, stood out clearly with
their hanging twigs, and their buds swollen almost to bursting.
From the thickest parts of the copse, where the snow still remained, came the
faint sound of narrow winding threads of water running away. Tiny birds
twittered, and now and then fluttered from tree to tree.
In the pauses of complete stillness there came the rustle of last year’s
leaves, stirred by the thawing of the earth and the growth of the grass.
“Imagine! One can hear and see the grass growing!” Levin said to
himself, noticing a wet, slate-colored aspen leaf moving beside a blade of
young grass. He stood, listened, and gazed sometimes down at the wet mossy
ground, sometimes at Laska listening all alert, sometimes at the sea of bare
tree tops that stretched on the slope below him, sometimes at the darkening
sky, covered with white streaks of cloud.
A hawk flew high over a forest far away with slow sweep of its wings; another
flew with exactly the same motion in the same direction and vanished. The birds
twittered more and more loudly and busily in the thicket. An owl hooted not far
off, and Laska, starting, stepped cautiously a few steps forward, and putting
her head on one side, began to listen intently. Beyond the stream was heard the
cuckoo. Twice she uttered her usual cuckoo call, and then gave a hoarse,
hurried call and broke down.
“Imagine! the cuckoo already!” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, coming out
from behind a bush.
“Yes, I hear it,” answered Levin, reluctantly breaking the
stillness with his voice, which sounded disagreeable to himself. “Now
it’s coming!”
Stepan Arkadyevitch’s figure again went behind the bush, and Levin saw
nothing but the bright flash of a match, followed by the red glow and blue
smoke of a cigarette.
“Tchk! tchk!” came the snapping sound of Stepan Arkadyevitch
cocking his gun.
“What’s that cry?” asked Oblonsky, drawing Levin’s
attention to a prolonged cry, as though a colt were whinnying in a high voice,
in play.
“Oh, don’t you know it? That’s the hare. But enough talking!
Listen, it’s flying!” almost shrieked Levin, cocking his gun.
They heard a shrill whistle in the distance, and in the exact time, so well
known to the sportsman, two seconds later—another, a third, and after the
third whistle the hoarse, guttural cry could be heard.
Levin looked about him to right and to left, and there, just facing him against
the dusky blue sky above the confused mass of tender shoots of the aspens, he
saw the flying bird. It was flying straight towards him; the guttural cry, like
the even tearing of some strong stuff, sounded close to his ear; the long beak
and neck of the bird could be seen, and at the very instant when Levin was
taking aim, behind the bush where Oblonsky stood, there was a flash of red
lightning: the bird dropped like an arrow, and darted upwards again. Again came
the red flash and the sound of a blow, and fluttering its wings as though
trying to keep up in the air, the bird halted, stopped still an instant, and
fell with a heavy splash on the slushy ground.
“Can I have missed it?” shouted Stepan Arkadyevitch, who could not
see for the smoke.
“Here it is!” said Levin, pointing to Laska, who with one ear
raised, wagging the end of her shaggy tail, came slowly back as though she
would prolong the pleasure, and as it were smiling, brought the dead bird to
her master. “Well, I’m glad you were successful,” said Levin,
who, at the same time, had a sense of envy that he had not succeeded in
shooting the snipe.
“It was a bad shot from the right barrel,” responded Stepan
Arkadyevitch, loading his gun. “Sh... it’s flying!”
The shrill whistles rapidly following one another were heard again. Two snipe,
playing and chasing one another, and only whistling, not crying, flew straight
at the very heads of the sportsmen. There was the report of four shots, and
like swallows the snipe turned swift somersaults in the air and vanished from
sight.
The stand-shooting was capital. Stepan Arkadyevitch shot two more birds and
Levin two, of which one was not found. It began to get dark. Venus, bright and
silvery, shone with her soft light low down in the west behind the birch trees,
and high up in the east twinkled the red lights of Arcturus. Over his head
Levin made out the stars of the Great Bear and lost them again. The snipe had
ceased flying; but Levin resolved to stay a little longer, till Venus, which he
saw below a branch of birch, should be above it, and the stars of the Great
Bear should be perfectly plain. Venus had risen above the branch, and the ear
of the Great Bear with its shaft was now all plainly visible against the dark
blue sky, yet still he waited.
“Isn’t it time to go home?” said Stepan Arkadyevitch.
It was quite still now in the copse, and not a bird was stirring.
“Let’s stay a little while,” answered Levin.
“As you like.”
They were standing now about fifteen paces from one another.
“Stiva!” said Levin unexpectedly; “how is it you don’t
tell me whether your sister-in-law’s married yet, or when she’s
going to be?”
Levin felt so resolute and serene that no answer, he fancied, could affect him.
But he had never dreamed of what Stepan Arkadyevitch replied.
“She’s never thought of being married, and isn’t thinking of
it; but she’s very ill, and the doctors have sent her abroad.
They’re positively afraid she may not live.”
“What!” cried Levin. “Very ill? What is wrong with her? How
has she...?”
While they were saying this, Laska, with ears pricked up, was looking upwards
at the sky, and reproachfully at them.
“They have chosen a time to talk,” she was thinking.
“It’s on the wing.... Here it is, yes, it is. They’ll miss
it,” thought Laska.
But at that very instant both suddenly heard a shrill whistle which, as it
were, smote on their ears, and both suddenly seized their guns and two flashes
gleamed, and two bangs sounded at the very same instant. The snipe flying high
above instantly folded its wings and fell into a thicket, bending down the
delicate shoots.
“Splendid! Together!” cried Levin, and he ran with Laska into the
thicket to look for the snipe.
“Oh, yes, what was it that was unpleasant?” he wondered.
“Yes, Kitty’s ill.... Well, it can’t be helped; I’m
very sorry,” he thought.
“She’s found it! Isn’t she a clever thing?” he said,
taking the warm bird from Laska’s mouth and packing it into the almost
full game bag. “I’ve got it, Stiva!” he shouted.
On the way home Levin asked all details of Kitty’s illness and the
Shtcherbatskys’ plans, and though he would have been ashamed to admit it,
he was pleased at what he heard. He was pleased that there was still hope, and
still more pleased that she should be suffering who had made him suffer so
much. But when Stepan Arkadyevitch began to speak of the causes of
Kitty’s illness, and mentioned Vronsky’s name, Levin cut him short.
“I have no right whatever to know family matters, and, to tell the truth,
no interest in them either.”
Stepan Arkadyevitch smiled hardly perceptibly, catching the instantaneous
change he knew so well in Levin’s face, which had become as gloomy as it
had been bright a minute before.
“Have you quite settled about the forest with Ryabinin?” asked
Levin.
“Yes, it’s settled. The price is magnificent; thirty-eight
thousand. Eight straight away, and the rest in six years. I’ve been
bothering about it for ever so long. No one would give more.”
“Then you’ve as good as given away your forest for nothing,”
said Levin gloomily.
“How do you mean for nothing?” said Stepan Arkadyevitch with a
good-humored smile, knowing that nothing would be right in Levin’s eyes
now.
“Because the forest is worth at least a hundred and fifty roubles the
acre,” answered Levin.
“Oh, these farmers!” said Stepan Arkadyevitch playfully.
“Your tone of contempt for us poor townsfolk!... But when it comes to
business, we do it better than anyone. I assure you I have reckoned it all
out,” he said, “and the forest is fetching a very good
price—so much so that I’m afraid of this fellow’s crying off,
in fact. You know it’s not ‘timber,’” said Stepan
Arkadyevitch, hoping by this distinction to convince Levin completely of the
unfairness of his doubts. “And it won’t run to more than
twenty-five yards of fagots per acre, and he’s giving me at the rate of
seventy roubles the acre.”
Levin smiled contemptuously. “I know,” he thought, “that
fashion not only in him, but in all city people, who, after being twice in ten
years in the country, pick up two or three phrases and use them in season and
out of season, firmly persuaded that they know all about it. ‘Timber,
run to so many yards the acre.’ He says those words without
understanding them himself.”
“I wouldn’t attempt to teach you what you write about in your
office,” said he, “and if need arose, I should come to you to ask
about it. But you’re so positive you know all the lore of the forest.
It’s difficult. Have you counted the trees?”
“How count the trees?” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, laughing, still
trying to draw his friend out of his ill-temper. “Count the sands of the
sea, number the stars. Some higher power might do it.”
“Oh, well, the higher power of Ryabinin can. Not a single merchant ever
buys a forest without counting the trees, unless they get it given them for
nothing, as you’re doing now. I know your forest. I go there every year
shooting, and your forest’s worth a hundred and fifty roubles an acre
paid down, while he’s giving you sixty by installments. So that in fact
you’re making him a present of thirty thousand.”
“Come, don’t let your imagination run away with you,” said
Stepan Arkadyevitch piteously. “Why was it none would give it,
then?”
“Why, because he has an understanding with the merchants; he’s
bought them off. I’ve had to do with all of them; I know them.
They’re not merchants, you know: they’re speculators. He
wouldn’t look at a bargain that gave him ten, fifteen per cent. profit,
but holds back to buy a rouble’s worth for twenty kopecks.”
“Well, enough of it! You’re out of temper.”
“Not the least,” said Levin gloomily, as they drove up to the
house.
At the steps there stood a trap tightly covered with iron and leather, with a
sleek horse tightly harnessed with broad collar-straps. In the trap sat the
chubby, tightly belted clerk who served Ryabinin as coachman. Ryabinin himself
was already in the house, and met the friends in the hall. Ryabinin was a tall,
thinnish, middle-aged man, with mustache and a projecting clean-shaven chin,
and prominent muddy-looking eyes. He was dressed in a long-skirted blue coat,
with buttons below the waist at the back, and wore high boots wrinkled over the
ankles and straight over the calf, with big galoshes drawn over them. He rubbed
his face with his handkerchief, and wrapping round him his coat, which sat
extremely well as it was, he greeted them with a smile, holding out his hand to
Stepan Arkadyevitch, as though he wanted to catch something.
“So here you are,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, giving him his hand.
“That’s capital.”
“I did not venture to disregard your excellency’s commands, though
the road was extremely bad. I positively walked the whole way, but I am here at
my time. Konstantin Dmitrievitch, my respects”; he turned to Levin,
trying to seize his hand too. But Levin, scowling, made as though he did not
notice his hand, and took out the snipe. “Your honors have been diverting
yourselves with the chase? What kind of bird may it be, pray?” added
Ryabinin, looking contemptuously at the snipe: “a great delicacy, I
suppose.” And he shook his head disapprovingly, as though he had grave
doubts whether this game were worth the candle.
“Would you like to go into my study?” Levin said in French to
Stepan Arkadyevitch, scowling morosely. “Go into my study; you can talk
there.”
“Quite so, where you please,” said Ryabinin with contemptuous
dignity, as though wishing to make it felt that others might be in difficulties
as to how to behave, but that he could never be in any difficulty about
anything.
On entering the study Ryabinin looked about, as his habit was, as though
seeking the holy picture, but when he had found it, he did not cross himself.
He scanned the bookcases and bookshelves, and with the same dubious air with
which he had regarded the snipe, he smiled contemptuously and shook his head
disapprovingly, as though by no means willing to allow that this game were
worth the candle.
“Well, have you brought the money?” asked Oblonsky. “Sit
down.”
“Oh, don’t trouble about the money. I’ve come to see you to
talk it over.”
“What is there to talk over? But do sit down.”
“I don’t mind if I do,” said Ryabinin, sitting down and
leaning his elbows on the back of his chair in a position of the intensest
discomfort to himself. “You must knock it down a bit, prince. It would be
too bad. The money is ready conclusively to the last farthing. As to paying the
money down, there’ll be no hitch there.”
Levin, who had meanwhile been putting his gun away in the cupboard, was just
going out of the door, but catching the merchant’s words, he stopped.
“Why, you’ve got the forest for nothing as it is,” he said.
“He came to me too late, or I’d have fixed the price for
him.”
Ryabinin got up, and in silence, with a smile, he looked Levin down and up.
“Very close about money is Konstantin Dmitrievitch,” he said with a
smile, turning to Stepan Arkadyevitch; “there’s positively no
dealing with him. I was bargaining for some wheat of him, and a pretty price I
offered too.”
“Why should I give you my goods for nothing? I didn’t pick it up on
the ground, nor steal it either.”
“Mercy on us! nowadays there’s no chance at all of stealing. With
the open courts and everything done in style, nowadays there’s no
question of stealing. We are just talking things over like gentlemen. His
excellency’s asking too much for the forest. I can’t make both ends
meet over it. I must ask for a little concession.”
“But is the thing settled between you or not? If it’s settled,
it’s useless haggling; but if it’s not,” said Levin,
“I’ll buy the forest.”
The smile vanished at once from Ryabinin’s face. A hawklike, greedy,
cruel expression was left upon it. With rapid, bony fingers he unbuttoned his
coat, revealing a shirt, bronze waistcoat buttons, and a watch chain, and
quickly pulled out a fat old pocketbook.
“Here you are, the forest is mine,” he said, crossing himself
quickly, and holding out his hand. “Take the money; it’s my forest.
That’s Ryabinin’s way of doing business; he doesn’t haggle
over every half-penny,” he added, scowling and waving the pocketbook.
“I wouldn’t be in a hurry if I were you,” said Levin.
“Come, really,” said Oblonsky in surprise. “I’ve given
my word, you know.”
Levin went out of the room, slamming the door. Ryabinin looked towards the door
and shook his head with a smile.
“It’s all youthfulness—positively nothing but boyishness.
Why, I’m buying it, upon my honor, simply, believe me, for the glory of
it, that Ryabinin, and no one else, should have bought the copse of Oblonsky.
And as to the profits, why, I must make what God gives. In God’s name. If
you would kindly sign the title-deed....”
Within an hour the merchant, stroking his big overcoat neatly down, and hooking
up his jacket, with the agreement in his pocket, seated himself in his tightly
covered trap, and drove homewards.
“Ugh, these gentlefolks!” he said to the clerk.
“They—they’re a nice lot!”
“That’s so,” responded the clerk, handing him the reins and
buttoning the leather apron. “But I can congratulate you on the purchase,
Mihail Ignatitch?”
“Well, well....”
Stepan Arkadyevitch went upstairs with his pocket bulging with notes, which the
merchant had paid him for three months in advance. The business of the forest
was over, the money in his pocket; their shooting had been excellent, and
Stepan Arkadyevitch was in the happiest frame of mind, and so he felt specially
anxious to dissipate the ill-humor that had come upon Levin. He wanted to
finish the day at supper as pleasantly as it had been begun.
Levin certainly was out of humor, and in spite of all his desire to be
affectionate and cordial to his charming visitor, he could not control his
mood. The intoxication of the news that Kitty was not married had gradually
begun to work upon him.
Kitty was not married, but ill, and ill from love for a man who had slighted
her. This slight, as it were, rebounded upon him. Vronsky had slighted her, and
she had slighted him, Levin. Consequently Vronsky had the right to despise
Levin, and therefore he was his enemy. But all this Levin did not think out. He
vaguely felt that there was something in it insulting to him, and he was not
angry now at what had disturbed him, but he fell foul of everything that
presented itself. The stupid sale of the forest, the fraud practiced upon
Oblonsky and concluded in his house, exasperated him.
“Well, finished?” he said, meeting Stepan Arkadyevitch upstairs.
“Would you like supper?”
“Well, I wouldn’t say no to it. What an appetite I get in the
country! Wonderful! Why didn’t you offer Ryabinin something?”
“Oh, damn him!”
“Still, how you do treat him!” said Oblonsky. “You
didn’t even shake hands with him. Why not shake hands with him?”
“Because I don’t shake hands with a waiter, and a waiter’s a
hundred times better than he is.”
“What a reactionist you are, really! What about the amalgamation of
classes?” said Oblonsky.
“Anyone who likes amalgamating is welcome to it, but it sickens
me.”
“You’re a regular reactionist, I see.”
“Really, I have never considered what I am. I am Konstantin Levin, and
nothing else.”
“And Konstantin Levin very much out of temper,” said Stepan
Arkadyevitch, smiling.
“Yes, I am out of temper, and do you know why? Because—excuse
me—of your stupid sale....”
Stepan Arkadyevitch frowned good-humoredly, like one who feels himself teased
and attacked for no fault of his own.
“Come, enough about it!” he said. “When did anybody ever sell
anything without being told immediately after the sale, ‘It was worth
much more’? But when one wants to sell, no one will give anything.... No,
I see you’ve a grudge against that unlucky Ryabinin.”
“Maybe I have. And do you know why? You’ll say again that I’m
a reactionist, or some other terrible word; but all the same it does annoy and
anger me to see on all sides the impoverishing of the nobility to which I
belong, and, in spite of the amalgamation of classes, I’m glad to belong.
And their impoverishment is not due to extravagance—that would be
nothing; living in good style—that’s the proper thing for noblemen;
it’s only the nobles who know how to do it. Now the peasants about us buy
land, and I don’t mind that. The gentleman does nothing, while the
peasant works and supplants the idle man. That’s as it ought to be. And
I’m very glad for the peasant. But I do mind seeing the process of
impoverishment from a sort of—I don’t know what to call
it—innocence. Here a Polish speculator bought for half its value a
magnificent estate from a young lady who lives in Nice. And there a merchant
will get three acres of land, worth ten roubles, as security for the loan of
one rouble. Here, for no kind of reason, you’ve made that rascal a
present of thirty thousand roubles.”
“Well, what should I have done? Counted every tree?”
“Of course, they must be counted. You didn’t count them, but
Ryabinin did. Ryabinin’s children will have means of livelihood and
education, while yours maybe will not!”
“Well, you must excuse me, but there’s something mean in this
counting. We have our business and they have theirs, and they must make their
profit. Anyway, the thing’s done, and there’s an end of it. And
here come some poached eggs, my favorite dish. And Agafea Mihalovna will give
us that marvelous herb-brandy....”
Stepan Arkadyevitch sat down at the table and began joking with Agafea
Mihalovna, assuring her that it was long since he had tasted such a dinner and
such a supper.
“Well, you do praise it, anyway,” said Agafea Mihalovna, “but
Konstantin Dmitrievitch, give him what you will—a crust of
bread—he’ll eat it and walk away.”
Though Levin tried to control himself, he was gloomy and silent. He wanted to
put one question to Stepan Arkadyevitch, but he could not bring himself to the
point, and could not find the words or the moment in which to put it. Stepan
Arkadyevitch had gone down to his room, undressed, again washed, and attired in
a nightshirt with goffered frills, he had got into bed, but Levin still
lingered in his room, talking of various trifling matters, and not daring to
ask what he wanted to know.
“How wonderfully they make this soap,” he said gazing at a piece of
soap he was handling, which Agafea Mihalovna had put ready for the visitor but
Oblonsky had not used. “Only look; why, it’s a work of art.”
“Yes, everything’s brought to such a pitch of perfection
nowadays,” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, with a moist and blissful yawn.
“The theater, for instance, and the entertainments ...
a—a—a!” he yawned. “The electric light everywhere ...
a—a—a!”
“Yes, the electric light,” said Levin. “Yes. Oh, and
where’s Vronsky now?” he asked suddenly, laying down the soap.
“Vronsky?” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, checking his yawn;
“he’s in Petersburg. He left soon after you did, and he’s not
once been in Moscow since. And do you know, Kostya, I’ll tell you the
truth,” he went on, leaning his elbow on the table, and propping on his
hand his handsome ruddy face, in which his moist, good-natured, sleepy eyes
shone like stars. “It’s your own fault. You took fright at the
sight of your rival. But, as I told you at the time, I couldn’t say which
had the better chance. Why didn’t you fight it out? I told you at the
time that....” He yawned inwardly, without opening his mouth.
“Does he know, or doesn’t he, that I did make an offer?”
Levin wondered, gazing at him. “Yes, there’s something humbugging,
diplomatic in his face,” and feeling he was blushing, he looked Stepan
Arkadyevitch straight in the face without speaking.
“If there was anything on her side at the time, it was nothing but a
superficial attraction,” pursued Oblonsky. “His being such a
perfect aristocrat, don’t you know, and his future position in society,
had an influence not with her, but with her mother.”
Levin scowled. The humiliation of his rejection stung him to the heart, as
though it were a fresh wound he had only just received. But he was at home, and
the walls of home are a support.
“Stay, stay,” he began, interrupting Oblonsky. “You talk of
his being an aristocrat. But allow me to ask what it consists in, that
aristocracy of Vronsky or of anybody else, beside which I can be looked down
upon? You consider Vronsky an aristocrat, but I don’t. A man whose father
crawled up from nothing at all by intrigue, and whose mother—God knows
whom she wasn’t mixed up with.... No, excuse me, but I consider myself
aristocratic, and people like me, who can point back in the past to three or
four honorable generations of their family, of the highest degree of breeding
(talent and intellect, of course that’s another matter), and have never
curried favor with anyone, never depended on anyone for anything, like my
father and my grandfather. And I know many such. You think it mean of me to
count the trees in my forest, while you make Ryabinin a present of thirty
thousand; but you get rents from your lands and I don’t know what, while
I don’t and so I prize what’s come to me from my ancestors or been
won by hard work.... We are aristocrats, and not those who can only exist by
favor of the powerful of this world, and who can be bought for twopence
halfpenny.”
“Well, but whom are you attacking? I agree with you,” said Stepan
Arkadyevitch, sincerely and genially; though he was aware that in the class of
those who could be bought for twopence halfpenny Levin was reckoning him too.
Levin’s warmth gave him genuine pleasure. “Whom are you attacking?
Though a good deal is not true that you say about Vronsky, but I won’t
talk about that. I tell you straight out, if I were you, I should go back with
me to Moscow, and....”
“No; I don’t know whether you know it or not, but I don’t
care. And I tell you—I did make an offer and was rejected, and Katerina
Alexandrovna is nothing now to me but a painful and humiliating
reminiscence.”
“What ever for? What nonsense!”
“But we won’t talk about it. Please forgive me, if I’ve been
nasty,” said Levin. Now that he had opened his heart, he became as he had
been in the morning. “You’re not angry with me, Stiva? Please
don’t be angry,” he said, and smiling, he took his hand.
“Of course not; not a bit, and no reason to be. I’m glad
we’ve spoken openly. And do you know, stand-shooting in the morning is
unusually good—why not go? I couldn’t sleep the night anyway, but I
might go straight from shooting to the station.”
“Capital.”
Although all Vronsky’s inner life was absorbed in his passion, his
external life unalterably and inevitably followed along the old accustomed
lines of his social and regimental ties and interests. The interests of his
regiment took an important place in Vronsky’s life, both because he was
fond of the regiment, and because the regiment was fond of him. They were not
only fond of Vronsky in his regiment, they respected him too, and were proud of
him; proud that this man, with his immense wealth, his brilliant education and
abilities, and the path open before him to every kind of success, distinction,
and ambition, had disregarded all that, and of all the interests of life had
the interests of his regiment and his comrades nearest to his heart. Vronsky
was aware of his comrades’ view of him, and in addition to his liking for
the life, he felt bound to keep up that reputation.
It need not be said that he did not speak of his love to any of his comrades,
nor did he betray his secret even in the wildest drinking bouts (though indeed
he was never so drunk as to lose all control of himself). And he shut up any of
his thoughtless comrades who attempted to allude to his connection. But in
spite of that, his love was known to all the town; everyone guessed with more
or less confidence at his relations with Madame Karenina. The majority of the
younger men envied him for just what was the most irksome factor in his
love—the exalted position of Karenin, and the consequent publicity of
their connection in society.
The greater number of the young women, who envied Anna and had long been weary
of hearing her called virtuous, rejoiced at the fulfillment of their
predictions, and were only waiting for a decisive turn in public opinion to
fall upon her with all the weight of their scorn. They were already making
ready their handfuls of mud to fling at her when the right moment arrived. The
greater number of the middle-aged people and certain great personages were
displeased at the prospect of the impending scandal in society.

1835
Amongst the novel objects that attracted my attention during my stay in the
United States, nothing struck me more forcibly than the general equality of
conditions. I readily discovered the prodigious influence which this primary
fact exercises on the whole course of society, by giving a certain direction to
public opinion, and a certain tenor to the laws; by imparting new maxims to the
governing powers, and peculiar habits to the governed. I speedily perceived
that the influence of this fact extends far beyond the political character and
the laws of the country, and that it has no less empire over civil society than
over the Government; it creates opinions, engenders sentiments, suggests the
ordinary practices of life, and modifies whatever it does not produce. The more
I advanced in the study of American society, the more I perceived that the
equality of conditions is the fundamental fact from which all others seem to be
derived, and the central point at which all my observations constantly
terminated.
I then turned my thoughts to our own hemisphere, where I imagined that I
discerned something analogous to the spectacle which the New World presented to
me. I observed that the equality of conditions is daily progressing towards
those extreme limits which it seems to have reached in the United States, and
that the democracy which governs the American communities appears to be rapidly
rising into power in Europe. I hence conceived the idea of the book which is
now before the reader.
It is evident to all alike that a great democratic revolution is going on
amongst us; but there are two opinions as to its nature and consequences. To
some it appears to be a novel accident, which as such may still be checked; to
others it seems irresistible, because it is the most uniform, the most ancient,
and the most permanent tendency which is to be found in history. Let us
recollect the situation of France seven hundred years ago, when the territory
was divided amongst a small number of families, who were the owners of the soil
and the rulers of the inhabitants; the right of governing descended with the
family inheritance from generation to generation; force was the only means by
which man could act on man, and landed property was the sole source of power.
Soon, however, the political power of the clergy was founded, and began to
exert itself: the clergy opened its ranks to all classes, to the poor and the
rich, the villein and the lord; equality penetrated into the Government through
the Church, and the being who as a serf must have vegetated in perpetual
bondage took his place as a priest in the midst of nobles, and not infrequently
above the heads of kings.
The different relations of men became more complicated and more numerous as
society gradually became more stable and more civilized. Thence the want of
civil laws was felt; and the order of legal functionaries soon rose from the
obscurity of the tribunals and their dusty chambers, to appear at the court of
the monarch, by the side of the feudal barons in their ermine and their mail.
Whilst the kings were ruining themselves by their great enterprises, and the
nobles exhausting their resources by private wars, the lower orders were
enriching themselves by commerce. The influence of money began to be
perceptible in State affairs. The transactions of business opened a new road to
power, and the financier rose to a station of political influence in which he
was at once flattered and despised. Gradually the spread of mental
acquirements, and the increasing taste for literature and art, opened chances
of success to talent; science became a means of government, intelligence led to
social power, and the man of letters took a part in the affairs of the State.
The value attached to the privileges of birth decreased in the exact proportion
in which new paths were struck out to advancement. In the eleventh century
nobility was beyond all price; in the thirteenth it might be purchased; it was
conferred for the first time in 1270; and equality was thus introduced into the
Government by the aristocracy itself.
In the course of these seven hundred years it sometimes happened that in order
to resist the authority of the Crown, or to diminish the power of their rivals,
the nobles granted a certain share of political rights to the people. Or, more
frequently, the king permitted the lower orders to enjoy a degree of power,
with the intention of repressing the aristocracy. In France the kings have
always been the most active and the most constant of levellers. When they were
strong and ambitious they spared no pains to raise the people to the level of
the nobles; when they were temperate or weak they allowed the people to rise
above themselves. Some assisted the democracy by their talents, others by their
vices. Louis XI and Louis XIV reduced every rank beneath the throne to the same
subjection; Louis XV descended, himself and all his Court, into the dust.
As soon as land was held on any other than a feudal tenure, and personal
property began in its turn to confer influence and power, every improvement
which was introduced in commerce or manufacture was a fresh element of the
equality of conditions. Henceforward every new discovery, every new want which
it engendered, and every new desire which craved satisfaction, was a step
towards the universal level. The taste for luxury, the love of war, the sway of
fashion, and the most superficial as well as the deepest passions of the human
heart, co-operated to enrich the poor and to impoverish the rich.
From the time when the exercise of the intellect became the source of strength
and of wealth, it is impossible not to consider every addition to science,
every fresh truth, and every new idea as a germ of power placed within the
reach of the people. Poetry, eloquence, and memory, the grace of wit, the glow
of imagination, the depth of thought, and all the gifts which are bestowed by
Providence with an equal hand, turned to the advantage of the democracy; and
even when they were in the possession of its adversaries they still served its
cause by throwing into relief the natural greatness of man; its conquests
spread, therefore, with those of civilization and knowledge, and literature
became an arsenal where the poorest and the weakest could always find weapons
to their hand.
In perusing the pages of our history, we shall scarcely meet with a single
great event, in the lapse of seven hundred years, which has not turned to the
advantage of equality. The Crusades and the wars of the English decimated the
nobles and divided their possessions; the erection of communities introduced an
element of democratic liberty into the bosom of feudal monarchy; the invention
of fire-arms equalized the villein and the noble on the field of battle;
printing opened the same resources to the minds of all classes; the post was
organized so as to bring the same information to the door of the poor
man’s cottage and to the gate of the palace; and Protestantism proclaimed
that all men are alike able to find the road to heaven. The discovery of
America offered a thousand new paths to fortune, and placed riches and power
within the reach of the adventurous and the obscure. If we examine what has
happened in France at intervals of fifty years, beginning with the eleventh
century, we shall invariably perceive that a twofold revolution has taken place
in the state of society. The noble has gone down on the social ladder, and the
roturier has gone up; the one descends as the other rises. Every half century
brings them nearer to each other, and they will very shortly meet.
Nor is this phenomenon at all peculiar to France. Whithersoever we turn our
eyes we shall witness the same continual revolution throughout the whole of
Christendom. The various occurrences of national existence have everywhere
turned to the advantage of democracy; all men have aided it by their exertions:
those who have intentionally labored in its cause, and those who have served it
unwittingly; those who have fought for it and those who have declared
themselves its opponents, have all been driven along in the same track, have
all labored to one end, some ignorantly and some unwillingly; all have been
blind instruments in the hands of God.
The gradual development of the equality of conditions is therefore a
providential fact, and it possesses all the characteristics of a divine decree:
it is universal, it is durable, it constantly eludes all human interference,
and all events as well as all men contribute to its progress. Would it, then,
be wise to imagine that a social impulse which dates from so far back can be
checked by the efforts of a generation? Is it credible that the democracy which
has annihilated the feudal system and vanquished kings will respect the citizen
and the capitalist? Will it stop now that it has grown so strong and its
adversaries so weak? None can say which way we are going, for all terms of
comparison are wanting: the equality of conditions is more complete in the
Christian countries of the present day than it has been at any time or in any
part of the world; so that the extent of what already exists prevents us from
foreseeing what may be yet to come.
The whole book which is here offered to the public has been written under the
impression of a kind of religious dread produced in the author’s mind by
the contemplation of so irresistible a revolution, which has advanced for
centuries in spite of such amazing obstacles, and which is still proceeding in
the midst of the ruins it has made. It is not necessary that God himself should
speak in order to disclose to us the unquestionable signs of His will; we can
discern them in the habitual course of nature, and in the invariable tendency
of events: I know, without a special revelation, that the planets move in the
orbits traced by the Creator’s finger. If the men of our time were led by
attentive observation and by sincere reflection to acknowledge that the gradual
and progressive development of social equality is at once the past and future
of their history, this solitary truth would confer the sacred character of a
Divine decree upon the change. To attempt to check democracy would be in that
case to resist the will of God; and the nations would then be constrained to
make the best of the social lot awarded to them by Providence.
The Christian nations of our age seem to me to present a most alarming
spectacle; the impulse which is bearing them along is so strong that it cannot
be stopped, but it is not yet so rapid that it cannot be guided: their fate is
in their hands; yet a little while and it may be so no longer. The first duty
which is at this time imposed upon those who direct our affairs is to educate
the democracy; to warm its faith, if that be possible; to purify its morals; to
direct its energies; to substitute a knowledge of business for its
inexperience, and an acquaintance with its true interests for its blind
propensities; to adapt its government to time and place, and to modify it in
compliance with the occurrences and the actors of the age. A new science of
politics is indispensable to a new world. This, however, is what we think of
least; launched in the middle of a rapid stream, we obstinately fix our eyes on
the ruins which may still be described upon the shore we have left, whilst the
current sweeps us along, and drives us backwards towards the gulf.
In no country in Europe has the great social revolution which I have been
describing made such rapid progress as in France; but it has always been borne
on by chance. The heads of the State have never had any forethought for its
exigencies, and its victories have been obtained without their consent or
without their knowledge. The most powerful, the most intelligent, and the most
moral classes of the nation have never attempted to connect themselves with it
in order to guide it. The people has consequently been abandoned to its wild
propensities, and it has grown up like those outcasts who receive their
education in the public streets, and who are unacquainted with aught but the
vices and wretchedness of society. The existence of a democracy was seemingly
unknown, when on a sudden it took possession of the supreme power. Everything
was then submitted to its caprices; it was worshipped as the idol of strength;
until, when it was enfeebled by its own excesses, the legislator conceived the
rash project of annihilating its power, instead of instructing it and
correcting its vices; no attempt was made to fit it to govern, but all were
bent on excluding it from the government.
The consequence of this has been that the democratic revolution has been
effected only in the material parts of society, without that concomitant change
in laws, ideas, customs, and manners which was necessary to render such a
revolution beneficial. We have gotten a democracy, but without the conditions
which lessen its vices and render its natural advantages more prominent; and
although we already perceive the evils it brings, we are ignorant of the
benefits it may confer.
While the power of the Crown, supported by the aristocracy, peaceably governed
the nations of Europe, society possessed, in the midst of its wretchedness,
several different advantages which can now scarcely be appreciated or
conceived. The power of a part of his subjects was an insurmountable barrier to
the tyranny of the prince; and the monarch, who felt the almost divine
character which he enjoyed in the eyes of the multitude, derived a motive for
the just use of his power from the respect which he inspired. High as they were
placed above the people, the nobles could not but take that calm and benevolent
interest in its fate which the shepherd feels towards his flock; and without
acknowledging the poor as their equals, they watched over the destiny of those
whose welfare Providence had entrusted to their care. The people never having
conceived the idea of a social condition different from its own, and
entertaining no expectation of ever ranking with its chiefs, received benefits
from them without discussing their rights. It grew attached to them when they
were clement and just, and it submitted without resistance or servility to
their exactions, as to the inevitable visitations of the arm of God. Custom,
and the manners of the time, had moreover created a species of law in the midst
of violence, and established certain limits to oppression. As the noble never
suspected that anyone would attempt to deprive him of the privileges which he
believed to be legitimate, and as the serf looked upon his own inferiority as a
consequence of the immutable order of nature, it is easy to imagine that a
mutual exchange of good-will took place between two classes so differently
gifted by fate. Inequality and wretchedness were then to be found in society;
but the souls of neither rank of men were degraded. Men are not corrupted by
the exercise of power or debased by the habit of obedience, but by the exercise
of a power which they believe to be illegal and by obedience to a rule which
they consider to be usurped and oppressive. On one side was wealth, strength,
and leisure, accompanied by the refinements of luxury, the elegance of taste,
the pleasures of wit, and the religion of art. On the other was labor and a
rude ignorance; but in the midst of this coarse and ignorant multitude it was
not uncommon to meet with energetic passions, generous sentiments, profound
religious convictions, and independent virtues. The body of a State thus
organized might boast of its stability, its power, and, above all, of its
glory.
But the scene is now changed, and gradually the two ranks mingle; the divisions
which once severed mankind are lowered, property is divided, power is held in
common, the light of intelligence spreads, and the capacities of all classes
are equally cultivated; the State becomes democratic, and the empire of
democracy is slowly and peaceably introduced into the institutions and the
manners of the nation. I can conceive a society in which all men would profess
an equal attachment and respect for the laws of which they are the common
authors; in which the authority of the State would be respected as necessary,
though not as divine; and the loyalty of the subject to its chief magistrate
would not be a passion, but a quiet and rational persuasion. Every individual
being in the possession of rights which he is sure to retain, a kind of manly
reliance and reciprocal courtesy would arise between all classes, alike removed
from pride and meanness. The people, well acquainted with its true interests,
would allow that in order to profit by the advantages of society it is
necessary to satisfy its demands. In this state of things the voluntary
association of the citizens might supply the individual exertions of the
nobles, and the community would be alike protected from anarchy and from
oppression.
I admit that, in a democratic State thus constituted, society will not be
stationary; but the impulses of the social body may be regulated and directed
forwards; if there be less splendor than in the halls of an aristocracy, the
contrast of misery will be less frequent also; the pleasures of enjoyment may
be less excessive, but those of comfort will be more general; the sciences may
be less perfectly cultivated, but ignorance will be less common; the
impetuosity of the feelings will be repressed, and the habits of the nation
softened; there will be more vices and fewer crimes. In the absence of
enthusiasm and of an ardent faith, great sacrifices may be obtained from the
members of a commonwealth by an appeal to their understandings and their
experience; each individual will feel the same necessity for uniting with his
fellow-citizens to protect his own weakness; and as he knows that if they are
to assist he must co-operate, he will readily perceive that his personal
interest is identified with the interest of the community. The nation, taken as
a whole, will be less brilliant, less glorious, and perhaps less strong; but
the majority of the citizens will enjoy a greater degree of prosperity, and the
people will remain quiet, not because it despairs of amelioration, but because
it is conscious of the advantages of its condition. If all the consequences of
this state of things were not good or useful, society would at least have
appropriated all such as were useful and good; and having once and for ever
renounced the social advantages of aristocracy, mankind would enter into
possession of all the benefits which democracy can afford.
But here it may be asked what we have adopted in the place of those
institutions, those ideas, and those customs of our forefathers which we have
abandoned. The spell of royalty is broken, but it has not been succeeded by the
majesty of the laws; the people has learned to despise all authority, but fear
now extorts a larger tribute of obedience than that which was formerly paid by
reverence and by love.
I perceive that we have destroyed those independent beings which were able to
cope with tyranny single-handed; but it is the Government that has inherited
the privileges of which families, corporations, and individuals have been
deprived; the weakness of the whole community has therefore succeeded that
influence of a small body of citizens, which, if it was sometimes oppressive,
was often conservative. The division of property has lessened the distance
which separated the rich from the poor; but it would seem that the nearer they
draw to each other, the greater is their mutual hatred, and the more vehement
the envy and the dread with which they resist each other’s claims to
power; the notion of Right is alike insensible to both classes, and Force
affords to both the only argument for the present, and the only guarantee for
the future. The poor man retains the prejudices of his forefathers without
their faith, and their ignorance without their virtues; he has adopted the
doctrine of self-interest as the rule of his actions, without understanding the
science which controls it, and his egotism is no less blind than his
devotedness was formerly. If society is tranquil, it is not because it relies
upon its strength and its well-being, but because it knows its weakness and its
infirmities; a single effort may cost it its life; everybody feels the evil,
but no one has courage or energy enough to seek the cure; the desires, the
regret, the sorrows, and the joys of the time produce nothing that is visible
or permanent, like the passions of old men which terminate in impotence.
We have, then, abandoned whatever advantages the old state of things afforded,
without receiving any compensation from our present condition; we have
destroyed an aristocracy, and we seem inclined to survey its ruins with
complacency, and to fix our abode in the midst of them.
The phenomena which the intellectual world presents are not less deplorable.
The democracy of France, checked in its course or abandoned to its lawless
passions, has overthrown whatever crossed its path, and has shaken all that it
has not destroyed. Its empire on society has not been gradually introduced or
peaceably established, but it has constantly advanced in the midst of disorder
and the agitation of a conflict. In the heat of the struggle each partisan is
hurried beyond the limits of his opinions by the opinions and the excesses of
his opponents, until he loses sight of the end of his exertions, and holds a
language which disguises his real sentiments or secret instincts. Hence arises
the strange confusion which we are witnessing. I cannot recall to my mind a
passage in history more worthy of sorrow and of pity than the scenes which are
happening under our eyes; it is as if the natural bond which unites the
opinions of man to his tastes and his actions to his principles was now broken;
the sympathy which has always been acknowledged between the feelings and the
ideas of mankind appears to be dissolved, and all the laws of moral analogy to
be abolished.
Zealous Christians may be found amongst us whose minds are nurtured in the love
and knowledge of a future life, and who readily espouse the cause of human
liberty as the source of all moral greatness. Christianity, which has declared
that all men are equal in the sight of God, will not refuse to acknowledge that
all citizens are equal in the eye of the law. But, by a singular concourse of
events, religion is entangled in those institutions which democracy assails,
and it is not unfrequently brought to reject the equality it loves, and to
curse that cause of liberty as a foe which it might hallow by its alliance.
By the side of these religious men I discern others whose looks are turned to
the earth more than to Heaven; they are the partisans of liberty, not only as
the source of the noblest virtues, but more especially as the root of all solid
advantages; and they sincerely desire to extend its sway, and to impart its
blessings to mankind. It is natural that they should hasten to invoke the
assistance of religion, for they must know that liberty cannot be established
without morality, nor morality without faith; but they have seen religion in
the ranks of their adversaries, and they inquire no further; some of them
attack it openly, and the remainder are afraid to defend it.
In former ages slavery has been advocated by the venal and slavish-minded,
whilst the independent and the warm-hearted were struggling without hope to
save the liberties of mankind. But men of high and generous characters are now
to be met with, whose opinions are at variance with their inclinations, and who
praise that servility which they have themselves never known. Others, on the
contrary, speak in the name of liberty, as if they were able to feel its
sanctity and its majesty, and loudly claim for humanity those rights which they
have always disowned. There are virtuous and peaceful individuals whose pure
morality, quiet habits, affluence, and talents fit them to be the leaders of
the surrounding population; their love of their country is sincere, and they
are prepared to make the greatest sacrifices to its welfare, but they confound
the abuses of civilization with its benefits, and the idea of evil is
inseparable in their minds from that of novelty.
Not far from this class is another party, whose object is to materialize
mankind, to hit upon what is expedient without heeding what is just, to acquire
knowledge without faith, and prosperity apart from virtue; assuming the title
of the champions of modern civilization, and placing themselves in a station
which they usurp with insolence, and from which they are driven by their own
unworthiness. Where are we then? The religionists are the enemies of liberty,
and the friends of liberty attack religion; the high-minded and the noble
advocate subjection, and the meanest and most servile minds preach
independence; honest and enlightened citizens are opposed to all progress,
whilst men without patriotism and without principles are the apostles of
civilization and of intelligence. Has such been the fate of the centuries which
have preceded our own? and has man always inhabited a world like the present,
where nothing is linked together, where virtue is without genius, and genius
without honor; where the love of order is confounded with a taste for
oppression, and the holy rites of freedom with a contempt of law; where the
light thrown by conscience on human actions is dim, and where nothing seems to
be any longer forbidden or allowed, honorable or shameful, false or true? I
cannot, however, believe that the Creator made man to leave him in an endless
struggle with the intellectual miseries which surround us: God destines a
calmer and a more certain future to the communities of Europe; I am
unacquainted with His designs, but I shall not cease to believe in them because
I cannot fathom them, and I had rather mistrust my own capacity than His
justice.
There is a country in the world where the great revolution which I am speaking
of seems nearly to have reached its natural limits; it has been effected with
ease and simplicity, say rather that this country has attained the consequences
of the democratic revolution which we are undergoing without having experienced
the revolution itself. The emigrants who fixed themselves on the shores of
America in the beginning of the seventeenth century severed the democratic
principle from all the principles which repressed it in the old communities of
Europe, and transplanted it unalloyed to the New World. It has there been
allowed to spread in perfect freedom, and to put forth its consequences in the
laws by influencing the manners of the country.
It appears to me beyond a doubt that sooner or later we shall arrive, like the
Americans, at an almost complete equality of conditions. But I do not conclude
from this that we shall ever be necessarily led to draw the same political
consequences which the Americans have derived from a similar social
organization. I am far from supposing that they have chosen the only form of
government which a democracy may adopt; but the identity of the efficient cause
of laws and manners in the two countries is sufficient to account for the
immense interest we have in becoming acquainted with its effects in each of
them.
It is not, then, merely to satisfy a legitimate curiosity that I have examined
America; my wish has been to find instruction by which we may ourselves profit.
Whoever should imagine that I have intended to write a panegyric will perceive
that such was not my design; nor has it been my object to advocate any form of
government in particular, for I am of opinion that absolute excellence is
rarely to be found in any legislation; I have not even affected to discuss
whether the social revolution, which I believe to be irresistible, is
advantageous or prejudicial to mankind; I have acknowledged this revolution as
a fact already accomplished or on the eve of its accomplishment; and I have
selected the nation, from amongst those which have undergone it, in which its
development has been the most peaceful and the most complete, in order to
discern its natural consequences, and, if it be possible, to distinguish the
means by which it may be rendered profitable. I confess that in America I saw
more than America; I sought the image of democracy itself, with its
inclinations, its character, its prejudices, and its passions, in order to
learn what we have to fear or to hope from its progress.
In the first part of this work I have attempted to show the tendency given to
the laws by the democracy of America, which is abandoned almost without
restraint to its instinctive propensities, and to exhibit the course it
prescribes to the Government and the influence it exercises on affairs. I have
sought to discover the evils and the advantages which it produces. I have
examined the precautions used by the Americans to direct it, as well as those
which they have not adopted, and I have undertaken to point out the causes
which enable it to govern society. I do not know whether I have succeeded in
making known what I saw in America, but I am certain that such has been my
sincere desire, and that I have never, knowingly, moulded facts to ideas,
instead of ideas to facts.
Whenever a point could be established by the aid of written documents, I have
had recourse to the original text, and to the most authentic and approved
works. I have cited my authorities in the notes, and anyone may refer to them.
Whenever an opinion, a political custom, or a remark on the manners of the
country was concerned, I endeavored to consult the most enlightened men I met
with. If the point in question was important or doubtful, I was not satisfied
with one testimony, but I formed my opinion on the evidence of several
witnesses. Here the reader must necessarily believe me upon my word. I could
frequently have quoted names which are either known to him, or which deserve to
be so, in proof of what I advance; but I have carefully abstained from this
practice. A stranger frequently hears important truths at the fire-side of his
host, which the latter would perhaps conceal from the ear of friendship; he
consoles himself with his guest for the silence to which he is restricted, and
the shortness of the traveller’s stay takes away all fear of his
indiscretion. I carefully noted every conversation of this nature as soon as it
occurred, but these notes will never leave my writing-case; I had rather injure
the success of my statements than add my name to the list of those strangers
who repay the generous hospitality they have received by subsequent chagrin and
annoyance.
I am aware that, notwithstanding my care, nothing will be easier than to
criticise this book, if anyone ever chooses to criticise it. Those readers who
may examine it closely will discover the fundamental idea which connects the
several parts together. But the diversity of the subjects I have had to treat
is exceedingly great, and it will not be difficult to oppose an isolated fact
to the body of facts which I quote, or an isolated idea to the body of ideas I
put forth. I hope to be read in the spirit which has guided my labors, and that
my book may be judged by the general impression it leaves, as I have formed my
own judgment not on any single reason, but upon the mass of evidence. It must
not be forgotten that the author who wishes to be understood is obliged to push
all his ideas to their utmost theoretical consequences, and often to the verge
of what is false or impracticable; for if it be necessary sometimes to quit the
rules of logic in active life, such is not the case in discourse, and a man
finds that almost as many difficulties spring from inconsistency of language as
usually arise from inconsistency of conduct.
I conclude by pointing out myself what many readers will consider the principal
defect of the work. This book is written to favor no particular views, and in
composing it I have entertained no designs of serving or attacking any party; I
have undertaken not to see differently, but to look further than parties, and
whilst they are busied for the morrow I have turned my thoughts to the Future.

Exterior Form Of North America
North America presents in its external form certain general features which it
is easy to discriminate at the first glance. A sort of methodical order seems
to have regulated the separation of land and water, mountains and valleys. A
simple, but grand, arrangement is discoverable amidst the confusion of objects
and the prodigious variety of scenes. This continent is divided, almost
equally, into two vast regions, one of which is bounded on the north by the
Arctic Pole, and by the two great oceans on the east and west. It stretches
towards the south, forming a triangle whose irregular sides meet at length
below the great lakes of Canada. The second region begins where the other
terminates, and includes all the remainder of the continent. The one slopes
gently towards the Pole, the other towards the Equator.
The territory comprehended in the first region descends towards the north with
so imperceptible a slope that it may almost be said to form a level plain.
Within the bounds of this immense tract of country there are neither high
mountains nor deep valleys. Streams meander through it irregularly: great
rivers mix their currents, separate and meet again, disperse and form vast
marshes, losing all trace of their channels in the labyrinth of waters they
have themselves created; and thus, at length, after innumerable windings, fall
into the Polar Seas. The great lakes which bound this first region are not
walled in, like most of those in the Old World, between hills and rocks. Their
banks are flat, and rise but a few feet above the level of their waters; each
of them thus forming a vast bowl filled to the brim. The slightest change in
the structure of the globe would cause their waters to rush either towards the
Pole or to the tropical sea.
The second region is more varied on its surface, and better suited for the
habitation of man. Two long chains of mountains divide it from one extreme to
the other; the Alleghany ridge takes the form of the shores of the Atlantic
Ocean; the other is parallel with the Pacific. The space which lies between
these two chains of mountains contains 1,341,649 square miles. *a Its surface
is therefore about six times as great as that of France. This vast territory,
however, forms a single valley, one side of which descends gradually from the
rounded summits of the Alleghanies, while the other rises in an uninterrupted
course towards the tops of the Rocky Mountains. At the bottom of the valley
flows an immense river, into which the various streams issuing from the
mountains fall from all parts. In memory of their native land, the French
formerly called this river the St. Louis. The Indians, in their pompous
language, have named it the Father of Waters, or the Mississippi.
a
[ Darby’s “View of the United States.”]
The Mississippi takes its source above the limit of the two great regions of
which I have spoken, not far from the highest point of the table-land where
they unite. Near the same spot rises another river, *b which empties itself
into the Polar seas. The course of the Mississippi is at first dubious: it
winds several times towards the north, from whence it rose; and at length,
after having been delayed in lakes and marshes, it flows slowly onwards to the
south. Sometimes quietly gliding along the argillaceous bed which nature has
assigned to it, sometimes swollen by storms, the Mississippi waters 2,500 miles
in its course. *c At the distance of 1,364 miles from its mouth this river
attains an average depth of fifteen feet; and it is navigated by vessels of 300
tons burden for a course of nearly 500 miles. Fifty-seven large navigable
rivers contribute to swell the waters of the Mississippi; amongst others, the
Missouri, which traverses a space of 2,500 miles; the Arkansas of 1,300 miles,
the Red River 1,000 miles, four whose course is from 800 to 1,000 miles in
length, viz., the Illinois, the St. Peter’s, the St. Francis, and the
Moingona; besides a countless multitude of rivulets which unite from all parts
their tributary streams.

c 
[ Warden’s “Description of the United States.”]
The valley which is watered by the Mississippi seems formed to be the bed of
this mighty river, which, like a god of antiquity, dispenses both good and evil
in its course. On the shores of the stream nature displays an inexhaustible
fertility; in proportion as you recede from its banks, the powers of vegetation
languish, the soil becomes poor, and the plants that survive have a sickly
growth. Nowhere have the great convulsions of the globe left more evident
traces than in the valley of the Mississippi; the whole aspect of the country
shows the powerful effects of water, both by its fertility and by its
barrenness. The waters of the primeval ocean accumulated enormous beds of
vegetable mould in the valley, which they levelled as they retired. Upon the
right shore of the river are seen immense plains, as smooth as if the
husbandman had passed over them with his roller. As you approach the mountains
the soil becomes more and more unequal and sterile; the ground is, as it were,
pierced in a thousand places by primitive rocks, which appear like the bones of
a skeleton whose flesh is partly consumed. The surface of the earth is covered
with a granite sand and huge irregular masses of stone, among which a few
plants force their growth, and give the appearance of a green field covered
with the ruins of a vast edifice. These stones and this sand discover, on
examination, a perfect analogy with those which compose the arid and broken
summits of the Rocky Mountains. The flood of waters which washed the soil to
the bottom of the valley afterwards carried away portions of the rocks
themselves; and these, dashed and bruised against the neighboring cliffs, were
left scattered like wrecks at their feet. *d The valley of the Mississippi is,
upon the whole, the most magnificent dwelling-place prepared by God for
man’s abode; and yet it may be said that at present it is but a mighty
desert.
d 
[ See Appendix, A.]
On the eastern side of the Alleghanies, between the base of these mountains and
the Atlantic Ocean, there lies a long ridge of rocks and sand, which the sea
appears to have left behind as it retired. The mean breadth of this territory
does not exceed one hundred miles; but it is about nine hundred miles in
length. This part of the American continent has a soil which offers every
obstacle to the husbandman, and its vegetation is scanty and unvaried.
Upon this inhospitable coast the first united efforts of human industry were
made. The tongue of arid land was the cradle of those English colonies which
were destined one day to become the United States of America. The centre of
power still remains here; whilst in the backwoods the true elements of the
great people to whom the future control of the continent belongs are gathering
almost in secrecy together.
When the Europeans first landed on the shores of the West Indies, and
afterwards on the coast of South America, they thought themselves transported
into those fabulous regions of which poets had sung. The sea sparkled with
phosphoric light, and the extraordinary transparency of its waters discovered
to the view of the navigator all that had hitherto been hidden in the deep
abyss. *e Here and there appeared little islands perfumed with odoriferous
plants, and resembling baskets of flowers floating on the tranquil surface of
the ocean. Every object which met the sight, in this enchanting region, seemed
prepared to satisfy the wants or contribute to the pleasures of man. Almost all
the trees were loaded with nourishing fruits, and those which were useless as
food delighted the eye by the brilliancy and variety of their colors. In groves
of fragrant lemon-trees, wild figs, flowering myrtles, acacias, and oleanders,
which were hung with festoons of various climbing plants, covered with flowers,
a multitude of birds unknown in Europe displayed their bright plumage,
glittering with purple and azure, and mingled their warbling with the harmony
of a world teeming with life and motion. *f Underneath this brilliant exterior
death was concealed. But the air of these climates had so enervating an
influence that man, absorbed by present enjoyment, was rendered regardless of
the future.
e 
[ Malte Brun tells us (vol. v. p. 726) that the water of the Caribbean Sea is
so transparent that corals and fish are discernible at a depth of sixty
fathoms. The ship seemed to float in air, the navigator became giddy as his eye
penetrated through the crystal flood, and beheld submarine gardens, or beds of
shells, or gilded fishes gliding among tufts and thickets of seaweed.]
f 
[ See Appendix, B.]
North America appeared under a very different aspect; there everything was
grave, serious, and solemn: it seemed created to be the domain of intelligence,
as the South was that of sensual delight. A turbulent and foggy ocean washed
its shores. It was girt round by a belt of granite rocks, or by wide tracts of
sand. The foliage of its woods was dark and gloomy, for they were composed of
firs, larches, evergreen oaks, wild olive-trees, and laurels. Beyond this outer
belt lay the thick shades of the central forest, where the largest trees which
are produced in the two hemispheres grow side by side. The plane, the catalpa,
the sugar-maple, and the Virginian poplar mingled their branches with those of
the oak, the beech, and the lime. In these, as in the forests of the Old World,
destruction was perpetually going on. The ruins of vegetation were heaped upon
each other; but there was no laboring hand to remove them, and their decay was
not rapid enough to make room for the continual work of reproduction. Climbing
plants, grasses, and other herbs forced their way through the mass of dying
trees; they crept along their bending trunks, found nourishment in their dusty
cavities, and a passage beneath the lifeless bark. Thus decay gave its
assistance to life, and their respective productions were mingled together. The
depths of these forests were gloomy and obscure, and a thousand rivulets,
undirected in their course by human industry, preserved in them a constant
moisture. It was rare to meet with flowers, wild fruits, or birds beneath their
shades. The fall of a tree overthrown by age, the rushing torrent of a
cataract, the lowing of the buffalo, and the howling of the wind were the only
sounds which broke the silence of nature.
To the east of the great river, the woods almost disappeared; in their stead
were seen prairies of immense extent. Whether Nature in her infinite variety
had denied the germs of trees to these fertile plains, or whether they had once
been covered with forests, subsequently destroyed by the hand of man, is a
question which neither tradition nor scientific research has been able to
resolve.
These immense deserts were not, however, devoid of human inhabitants. Some
wandering tribes had been for ages scattered among the forest shades or the
green pastures of the prairie. From the mouth of the St. Lawrence to the delta
of the Mississippi, and from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean, these savages
possessed certain points of resemblance which bore witness of their common
origin; but at the same time they differed from all other known races of men:
*g they were neither white like the Europeans, nor yellow like most of the
Asiatics, nor black like the negroes. Their skin was reddish brown, their hair
long and shining, their lips thin, and their cheekbones very prominent. The
languages spoken by the North American tribes are various as far as regarded
their words, but they were subject to the same grammatical rules. These rules
differed in several points from such as had been observed to govern the origin
of language. The idiom of the Americans seemed to be the product of new
combinations, and bespoke an effort of the understanding of which the Indians
of our days would be incapable. *h
g 
[ With the progress of discovery some resemblance has been found to exist
between the physical conformation, the language, and the habits of the Indians
of North America, and those of the Tongous, Mantchous, Mongols, Tartars, and
other wandering tribes of Asia. The land occupied by these tribes is not very
distant from Behring’s Strait, which allows of the supposition, that at a
remote period they gave inhabitants to the desert continent of America. But
this is a point which has not yet been clearly elucidated by science. See Malte
Brun, vol. v.; the works of Humboldt; Fischer, “Conjecture sur
l’Origine des Americains”; Adair, “History of the American
Indians.”]
h 
[ See Appendix, C.]
The social state of these tribes differed also in many respects from all that
was seen in the Old World. They seemed to have multiplied freely in the midst
of their deserts without coming in contact with other races more civilized than
their own. Accordingly, they exhibited none of those indistinct, incoherent
notions of right and wrong, none of that deep corruption of manners, which is
usually joined with ignorance and rudeness among nations which, after advancing
to civilization, have relapsed into a state of barbarism. The Indian was
indebted to no one but himself; his virtues, his vices, and his prejudices were
his own work; he had grown up in the wild independence of his nature.
If, in polished countries, the lowest of the people are rude and uncivil, it is
not merely because they are poor and ignorant, but that, being so, they are in
daily contact with rich and enlightened men. The sight of their own hard lot
and of their weakness, which is daily contrasted with the happiness and power
of some of their fellow-creatures, excites in their hearts at the same time the
sentiments of anger and of fear: the consciousness of their inferiority and of
their dependence irritates while it humiliates them. This state of mind
displays itself in their manners and language; they are at once insolent and
servile. The truth of this is easily proved by observation; the people are more
rude in aristocratic countries than elsewhere, in opulent cities than in rural
districts. In those places where the rich and powerful are assembled together
the weak and the indigent feel themselves oppressed by their inferior
condition. Unable to perceive a single chance of regaining their equality, they
give up to despair, and allow themselves to fall below the dignity of human
nature.
This unfortunate effect of the disparity of conditions is not observable in
savage life: the Indians, although they are ignorant and poor, are equal and
free. At the period when Europeans first came among them the natives of North
America were ignorant of the value of riches, and indifferent to the enjoyments
which civilized man procures to himself by their means. Nevertheless there was
nothing coarse in their demeanor; they practised an habitual reserve and a kind
of aristocratic politeness. Mild and hospitable when at peace, though merciless
in war beyond any known degree of human ferocity, the Indian would expose
himself to die of hunger in order to succor the stranger who asked admittance
by night at the door of his hut; yet he could tear in pieces with his hands the
still quivering limbs of his prisoner. The famous republics of antiquity never
gave examples of more unshaken courage, more haughty spirits, or more
intractable love of independence than were hidden in former times among the
wild forests of the New World. *i The Europeans produced no great impression
when they landed upon the shores of North America; their presence engendered
neither envy nor fear. What influence could they possess over such men as we
have described? The Indian could live without wants, suffer without complaint,
and pour out his death-song at the stake. *j Like all the other members of the
great human family, these savages believed in the existence of a better world,
and adored under different names, God, the creator of the universe. Their
notions on the great intellectual truths were in general simple and
philosophical. *k

[ We learn from President Jefferson’s “Notes upon Virginia,”
p. 148, that among the Iroquois, when attacked by a superior force, aged men
refused to fly or to survive the destruction of their country; and they braved
death like the ancient Romans when their capital was sacked by the Gauls.
Further on, p. 150, he tells us that there is no example of an Indian who,
having fallen into the hands of his enemies, begged for his life; on the
contrary, the captive sought to obtain death at the hands of his conquerors by
the use of insult and provocation.]

[ See Appendix, D.]
Although we have here traced the character of a primitive people, yet it cannot
be doubted that another people, more civilized and more advanced in all
respects, had preceded it in the same regions.
An obscure tradition which prevailed among the Indians to the north of the
Atlantic informs us that these very tribes formerly dwelt on the west side of
the Mississippi. Along the banks of the Ohio, and throughout the central
valley, there are frequently found, at this day, tumuli raised by the hands of
men. On exploring these heaps of earth to their centre, it is usual to meet
with human bones, strange instruments, arms and utensils of all kinds, made of
metal, or destined for purposes unknown to the present race. The Indians of our
time are unable to give any information relative to the history of this unknown
people. Neither did those who lived three hundred years ago, when America was
first discovered, leave any accounts from which even an hypothesis could be
formed. Tradition—that perishable, yet ever renewed monument of the
pristine world—throws no light upon the subject. It is an undoubted fact,
however, that in this part of the globe thousands of our fellow-beings had
lived. When they came hither, what was their origin, their destiny, their
history, and how they perished, no one can tell. How strange does it appear
that nations have existed, and afterwards so completely disappeared from the
earth that the remembrance of their very names is effaced; their languages are
lost; their glory is vanished like a sound without an echo; though perhaps
there is not one which has not left behind it some tomb in memory of its
passage! The most durable monument of human labor is that which recalls the
wretchedness and nothingness of man.
Although the vast country which we have been describing was inhabited by many
indigenous tribes, it may justly be said at the time of its discovery by
Europeans to have formed one great desert. The Indians occupied without
possessing it. It is by agricultural labor that man appropriates the soil, and
the early inhabitants of North America lived by the produce of the chase. Their
implacable prejudices, their uncontrolled passions, their vices, and still more
perhaps their savage virtues, consigned them to inevitable destruction. The
ruin of these nations began from the day when Europeans landed on their shores;
it has proceeded ever since, and we are now witnessing the completion of it.
They seem to have been placed by Providence amidst the riches of the New World
to enjoy them for a season, and then surrender them. Those coasts, so admirably
adapted for commerce and industry; those wide and deep rivers; that
inexhaustible valley of the Mississippi; the whole continent, in short, seemed
prepared to be the abode of a great nation, yet unborn.
In that land the great experiment was to be made, by civilized man, of the
attempt to construct society upon a new basis; and it was there, for the first
time, that theories hitherto unknown, or deemed impracticable, were to exhibit
a spectacle for which the world had not been prepared by the history of the
past.

Origin Of The Anglo-Americans, And Its Importance In Relation To Their Future
Condition.
After the birth of a human being his early years are obscurely spent in the
toils or pleasures of childhood. As he grows up the world receives him, when
his manhood begins, and he enters into contact with his fellows. He is then
studied for the first time, and it is imagined that the germ of the vices and
the virtues of his maturer years is then formed. This, if I am not mistaken, is
a great error. We must begin higher up; we must watch the infant in its
mother’s arms; we must see the first images which the external world
casts upon the dark mirror of his mind; the first occurrences which he
witnesses; we must hear the first words which awaken the sleeping powers of
thought, and stand by his earliest efforts, if we would understand the
prejudices, the habits, and the passions which will rule his life. The entire
man is, so to speak, to be seen in the cradle of the child.
The growth of nations presents something analogous to this: they all bear some
marks of their origin; and the circumstances which accompanied their birth and
contributed to their rise affect the whole term of their being. If we were able
to go back to the elements of states, and to examine the oldest monuments of
their history, I doubt not that we should discover the primal cause of the
prejudices, the habits, the ruling passions, and, in short, of all that
constitutes what is called the national character; we should then find the
explanation of certain customs which now seem at variance with the prevailing
manners; of such laws as conflict with established principles; and of such
incoherent opinions as are here and there to be met with in society, like those
fragments of broken chains which we sometimes see hanging from the vault of an
edifice, and supporting nothing. This might explain the destinies of certain
nations, which seem borne on by an unknown force to ends of which they
themselves are ignorant. But hitherto facts have been wanting to researches of
this kind: the spirit of inquiry has only come upon communities in their latter
days; and when they at length contemplated their origin, time had already
obscured it, or ignorance and pride adorned it with truth-concealing fables.
America is the only country in which it has been possible to witness the
natural and tranquil growth of society, and where the influences exercised on
the future condition of states by their origin is clearly distinguishable. At
the period when the peoples of Europe landed in the New World their national
characteristics were already completely formed; each of them had a physiognomy
of its own; and as they had already attained that stage of civilization at
which men are led to study themselves, they have transmitted to us a faithful
picture of their opinions, their manners, and their laws. The men of the
sixteenth century are almost as well known to us as our contemporaries.
America, consequently, exhibits in the broad light of day the phenomena which
the ignorance or rudeness of earlier ages conceals from our researches. Near
enough to the time when the states of America were founded, to be accurately
acquainted with their elements, and sufficiently removed from that period to
judge of some of their results, the men of our own day seem destined to see
further than their predecessors into the series of human events. Providence has
given us a torch which our forefathers did not possess, and has allowed us to
discern fundamental causes in the history of the world which the obscurity of
the past concealed from them. If we carefully examine the social and political
state of America, after having studied its history, we shall remain perfectly
convinced that not an opinion, not a custom, not a law, I may even say not an
event, is upon record which the origin of that people will not explain. The
readers of this book will find the germ of all that is to follow in the present
chapter, and the key to almost the whole work.
The emigrants who came, at different periods to occupy the territory now
covered by the American Union differed from each other in many respects; their
aim was not the same, and they governed themselves on different principles.
These men had, however, certain features in common, and they were all placed in
an analogous situation. The tie of language is perhaps the strongest and the
most durable that can unite mankind. All the emigrants spoke the same tongue;
they were all offsets from the same people. Born in a country which had been
agitated for centuries by the struggles of faction, and in which all parties
had been obliged in their turn to place themselves under the protection of the
laws, their political education had been perfected in this rude school, and
they were more conversant with the notions of right and the principles of true
freedom than the greater part of their European contemporaries. At the period
of their first emigrations the parish system, that fruitful germ of free
institutions, was deeply rooted in the habits of the English; and with it the
doctrine of the sovereignty of the people had been introduced into the bosom of
the monarchy of the House of Tudor.
The religious quarrels which have agitated the Christian world were then rife.
England had plunged into the new order of things with headlong vehemence. The
character of its inhabitants, which had always been sedate and reflective,
became argumentative and austere. General information had been increased by
intellectual debate, and the mind had received a deeper cultivation. Whilst
religion was the topic of discussion, the morals of the people were reformed.
All these national features are more or less discoverable in the physiognomy of
those adventurers who came to seek a new home on the opposite shores of the
Atlantic.
Another remark, to which we shall hereafter have occasion to recur, is
applicable not only to the English, but to the French, the Spaniards, and all
the Europeans who successively established themselves in the New World. All
these European colonies contained the elements, if not the development, of a
complete democracy. Two causes led to this result. It may safely be advanced,
that on leaving the mother-country the emigrants had in general no notion of
superiority over one another. The happy and the powerful do not go into exile,
and there are no surer guarantees of equality among men than poverty and
misfortune. It happened, however, on several occasions, that persons of rank
were driven to America by political and religious quarrels. Laws were made to
establish a gradation of ranks; but it was soon found that the soil of America
was opposed to a territorial aristocracy. To bring that refractory land into
cultivation, the constant and interested exertions of the owner himself were
necessary; and when the ground was prepared, its produce was found to be
insufficient to enrich a master and a farmer at the same time. The land was
then naturally broken up into small portions, which the proprietor cultivated
for himself. Land is the basis of an aristocracy, which clings to the soil that
supports it; for it is not by privileges alone, nor by birth, but by landed
property handed down from generation to generation, that an aristocracy is
constituted. A nation may present immense fortunes and extreme wretchedness,
but unless those fortunes are territorial there is no aristocracy, but simply
the class of the rich and that of the poor.
All the British colonies had then a great degree of similarity at the epoch of
their settlement. All of them, from their first beginning, seemed destined to
witness the growth, not of the aristocratic liberty of their mother-country,
but of that freedom of the middle and lower orders of which the history of the
world had as yet furnished no complete example.
In this general uniformity several striking differences were however
discernible, which it is necessary to point out. Two branches may be
distinguished in the Anglo-American family, which have hitherto grown up
without entirely commingling; the one in the South, the other in the North.
Virginia received the first English colony; the emigrants took possession of it
in 1607. The idea that mines of gold and silver are the sources of national
wealth was at that time singularly prevalent in Europe; a fatal delusion, which
has done more to impoverish the nations which adopted it, and has cost more
lives in America, than the united influence of war and bad laws. The men sent
to Virginia *a were seekers of gold, adventurers, without resources and without
character, whose turbulent and restless spirit endangered the infant colony, *b
and rendered its progress uncertain. The artisans and agriculturists arrived
afterwards; and, although they were a more moral and orderly race of men, they
were in nowise above the level of the inferior classes in England. *c No lofty
conceptions, no intellectual system, directed the foundation of these new
settlements. The colony was scarcely established when slavery was introduced,
*d and this was the main circumstance which has exercised so prodigious an
influence on the character, the laws, and all the future prospects of the
South. Slavery, as we shall afterwards show, dishonors labor; it introduces
idleness into society, and with idleness, ignorance and pride, luxury and
distress. It enervates the powers of the mind, and benumbs the activity of man.
The influence of slavery, united to the English character, explains the manners
and the social condition of the Southern States.

conditions, that the adventurers should pay to the Crown a fifth of the produce
of all gold and silver mines. See Marshall’s “Life of

adventurers, says Stith (“History of Virginia”), were unprincipled
young men of family, whom their parents were glad to ship off, discharged
servants, fraudulent bankrupts, or debauchees; and others of the same class,
people more apt to pillage and destroy than to assist the settlement, were the
seditious chiefs, who easily led this band into every kind of extravagance and
excess. See for the history of Virginia the following works:—

[ It was not till some time later that a certain number of rich English
capitalists came to fix themselves in the colony.]

[ Slavery was introduced about the year 1620 by a Dutch vessel which landed
twenty negroes on the banks of the river James. See Chalmer.]
In the North, the same English foundation was modified by the most opposite
shades of character; and here I may be allowed to enter into some details. The
two or three main ideas which constitute the basis of the social theory of the
United States were first combined in the Northern English colonies, more
generally denominated the States of New England. *e The principles of New
England spread at first to the neighboring states; they then passed
successively to the more distant ones; and at length they imbued the whole
Confederation. They now extend their influence beyond its limits over the whole
American world. The civilization of New England has been like a beacon lit upon
a hill, which, after it has diffused its warmth around, tinges the distant
horizon with its glow.
e 
[ The States of New England are those situated to the east of the Hudson; they
are now six in number: 1, Connecticut; 2, Rhode Island; 3, Massachusetts; 4,
Vermont; 5, New Hampshire; 6, Maine.]
The foundation of New England was a novel spectacle, and all the circumstances
attending it were singular and original. The large majority of colonies have
been first inhabited either by men without education and without resources,
driven by their poverty and their misconduct from the land which gave them
birth, or by speculators and adventurers greedy of gain. Some settlements
cannot even boast so honorable an origin; St. Domingo was founded by
buccaneers; and the criminal courts of England originally supplied the
population of Australia.
The settlers who established themselves on the shores of New England all
belonged to the more independent classes of their native country. Their union
on the soil of America at once presented the singular phenomenon of a society
containing neither lords nor common people, neither rich nor poor. These men
possessed, in proportion to their number, a greater mass of intelligence than
is to be found in any European nation of our own time. All, without a single
exception, had received a good education, and many of them were known in Europe
for their talents and their acquirements. The other colonies had been founded
by adventurers without family; the emigrants of New England brought with them
the best elements of order and morality—they landed in the desert
accompanied by their wives and children. But what most especially distinguished
them was the aim of their undertaking. They had not been obliged by necessity
to leave their country; the social position they abandoned was one to be
regretted, and their means of subsistence were certain. Nor did they cross the
Atlantic to improve their situation or to increase their wealth; the call which
summoned them from the comforts of their homes was purely intellectual; and in
facing the inevitable sufferings of exile their object was the triumph of an
idea.
The emigrants, or, as they deservedly styled themselves, the Pilgrims, belonged
to that English sect the austerity of whose principles had acquired for them
the name of Puritans. Puritanism was not merely a religious doctrine, but it
corresponded in many points with the most absolute democratic and republican
theories. It was this tendency which had aroused its most dangerous
adversaries. Persecuted by the Government of the mother-country, and disgusted
by the habits of a society opposed to the rigor of their own principles, the
Puritans went forth to seek some rude and unfrequented part of the world, where
they could live according to their own opinions, and worship God in freedom.
A few quotations will throw more light upon the spirit of these pious
adventures than all we can say of them. Nathaniel Morton, *f the historian of
the first years of the settlement, thus opens his subject:
f 
[ “New England’s Memorial,” p. 13; Boston, 1826. See also
“Hutchinson’s History,” vol. ii. p. 440.]
“Gentle Reader,—I have for some length of time looked upon it as a
duty incumbent, especially on the immediate successors of those that have had
so large experience of those many memorable and signal demonstrations of
God’s goodness, viz., the first beginners of this Plantation in New
England, to commit to writing his gracious dispensations on that behalf; having
so many inducements thereunto, not onely otherwise but so plentifully in the
Sacred Scriptures: that so, what we have seen, and what our fathers have told
us (Psalm lxxviii. 3, 4), we may not hide from our children, showing to the
generations to come the praises of the Lord; that especially the seed of
Abraham his servant, and the children of Jacob his chosen (Psalm cv. 5, 6), may
remember his marvellous works in the beginning and progress of the planting of
New England, his wonders and the judgments of his mouth; how that God brought a
vine into this wilderness; that he cast out the heathen, and planted it; that
he made room for it and caused it to take deep root; and it filled the land
(Psalm lxxx. 8, 9). And not onely so, but also that he hath guided his people
by his strength to his holy habitation and planted them in the mountain of his
inheritance in respect of precious Gospel enjoyments: and that as especially
God may have the glory of all unto whom it is most due; so also some rays of
glory may reach the names of those blessed Saints that were the main
instruments and the beginning of this happy enterprise.”
It is impossible to read this opening paragraph without an involuntary feeling
of religious awe; it breathes the very savor of Gospel antiquity. The sincerity
of the author heightens his power of language. The band which to his eyes was a
mere party of adventurers gone forth to seek their fortune beyond seas appears
to the reader as the germ of a great nation wafted by Providence to a
predestined shore.
The author thus continues his narrative of the departure of the first
pilgrims:—
“So they left that goodly and pleasant city of Leyden, *g which had been
their resting-place for above eleven years; but they knew that they were
pilgrims and strangers here below, and looked not much on these things, but
lifted up their eyes to Heaven, their dearest country, where God hath prepared
for them a city (Heb. xi. 16), and therein quieted their spirits. When they
came to Delfs-Haven they found the ship and all things ready; and such of their
friends as could not come with them followed after them, and sundry came from
Amsterdam to see them shipt, and to take their leaves of them. One night was
spent with little sleep with the most, but with friendly entertainment and
Christian discourse, and other real expressions of true Christian love. The
next day they went on board, and their friends with them, where truly doleful
was the sight of that sad and mournful parting, to hear what sighs and sobs and
prayers did sound amongst them; what tears did gush from every eye, and pithy
speeches pierced each other’s heart, that sundry of the Dutch strangers
that stood on the Key as spectators could not refrain from tears. But the tide
(which stays for no man) calling them away, that were thus loth to depart,
their Reverend Pastor falling down on his knees, and they all with him, with
watery cheeks commended them with most fervent prayers unto the Lord and his
blessing; and then, with mutual embraces and many tears they took their leaves
one of another, which proved to be the last leave to many of them.”
g 
[ The emigrants were, for the most part, godly Christians from the North of
England, who had quitted their native country because they were “studious
of reformation, and entered into covenant to walk with one another according to
the primitive pattern of the Word of God.” They emigrated to Holland, and
settled in the city of Leyden in 1610, where they abode, being lovingly
respected by the Dutch, for many years: they left it in 1620 for several
reasons, the last of which was, that their posterity would in a few generations
become Dutch, and so lose their interest in the English nation; they being
desirous rather to enlarge His Majesty’s dominions, and to live under
their natural prince.—Translator’s Note.]
The emigrants were about 150 in number, including the women and the children.
Their object was to plant a colony on the shores of the Hudson; but after
having been driven about for some time in the Atlantic Ocean, they were forced
to land on that arid coast of New England which is now the site of the town of
Plymouth. The rock is still shown on which the pilgrims disembarked. *h
h 
[ This rock is become an object of veneration in the United States. I have seen
bits of it carefully preserved in several towns of the Union. Does not this
sufficiently show how entirely all human power and greatness is in the soul of
man? Here is a stone which the feet of a few outcasts pressed for an instant,
and this stone becomes famous; it is treasured by a great nation, its very dust
is shared as a relic: and what is become of the gateways of a thousand
palaces?]
“But before we pass on,” continues our historian, “let the
reader with me make a pause and seriously consider this poor people’s
present condition, the more to be raised up to admiration of God’s
goodness towards them in their preservation: for being now passed the vast
ocean, and a sea of troubles before them in expectation, they had now no
friends to welcome them, no inns to entertain or refresh them, no houses, or
much less towns to repair unto to seek for succour: and for the season it was
winter, and they that know the winters of the country know them to be sharp and
violent, subject to cruel and fierce storms, dangerous to travel to known
places, much more to search unknown coasts. Besides, what could they see but a
hideous and desolate wilderness, full of wilde beasts, and wilde men? and what
multitudes of them there were, they then knew not: for which way soever they
turned their eyes (save upward to Heaven) they could have but little solace or
content in respect of any outward object; for summer being ended, all things
stand in appearance with a weather-beaten face, and the whole country full of
woods and thickets, represented a wild and savage hew; if they looked behind
them, there was the mighty ocean which they had passed, and was now as a main
bar or gulph to separate them from all the civil parts of the world.”
It must not be imagined that the piety of the Puritans was of a merely
speculative kind, or that it took no cognizance of the course of worldly
affairs. Puritanism, as I have already remarked, was scarcely less a political
than a religious doctrine. No sooner had the emigrants landed on the barren
coast described by Nathaniel Morton than it was their first care to constitute
a society, by passing the following Act:
“In the name of God. Amen. We, whose names are underwritten, the loyal
subjects of our dread Sovereign Lord King James, etc., etc., Having undertaken
for the glory of God, and advancement of the Christian Faith, and the honour of
our King and country, a voyage to plant the first colony in the northern parts
of Virginia; Do by these presents solemnly and mutually, in the presence of God
and one another, covenant and combine ourselves together into a civil body
politick, for our better ordering and preservation, and furtherance of the ends
aforesaid: and by virtue hereof do enact, constitute and frame such just and
equal laws, ordinances, acts, constitutions, and officers, from time to time,
as shall be thought most meet and convenient for the general good of the
Colony: unto which we promise all due submission and obedience,” etc. *i
i 
[ The emigrants who founded the State of Rhode Island in 1638, those who landed
at New Haven in 1637, the first settlers in Connecticut in 1639, and the
founders of Providence in 1640, began in like manner by drawing up a social
contract, which was acceded to by all the interested parties. See
“Pitkin’s History,” pp. 42 and 47.]
This happened in 1620, and from that time forwards the emigration went on. The
religious and political passions which ravaged the British Empire during the
whole reign of Charles I drove fresh crowds of sectarians every year to the
shores of America. In England the stronghold of Puritanism was in the middle
classes, and it was from the middle classes that the majority of the emigrants
came. The population of New England increased rapidly; and whilst the hierarchy
of rank despotically classed the inhabitants of the mother-country, the colony
continued to present the novel spectacle of a community homogeneous in all its
parts. A democracy, more perfect than any which antiquity had dreamt of,
started in full size and panoply from the midst of an ancient feudal society.
The English Government was not dissatisfied with an emigration which removed
the elements of fresh discord and of further revolutions. On the contrary,
everything was done to encourage it, and great exertions were made to mitigate
the hardships of those who sought a shelter from the rigor of their
country’s laws on the soil of America. It seemed as if New England was a
region given up to the dreams of fancy and the unrestrained experiments of
innovators.
The English colonies (and this is one of the main causes of their prosperity)
have always enjoyed more internal freedom and more political independence than
the colonies of other nations; but this principle of liberty was nowhere more
extensively applied than in the States of New England.
It was generally allowed at that period that the territories of the New World
belonged to that European nation which had been the first to discover them.
Nearly the whole coast of North America thus became a British possession
towards the end of the sixteenth century. The means used by the English
Government to people these new domains were of several kinds; the King
sometimes appointed a governor of his own choice, who ruled a portion of the
New World in the name and under the immediate orders of the Crown; *j this is
the colonial system adopted by other countries of Europe. Sometimes grants of
certain tracts were made by the Crown to an individual or to a company, *k in
which case all the civil and political power fell into the hands of one or more
persons, who, under the inspection and control of the Crown, sold the lands and
governed the inhabitants. Lastly, a third system consisted in allowing a
certain number of emigrants to constitute a political society under the
protection of the mother-country, and to govern themselves in whatever was not
contrary to her laws. This mode of colonization, so remarkably favorable to
liberty, was only adopted in New England. *l
j 
[ This was the case in the State of New York.]
k 
[ Maryland, the Carolinas, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey were in this situation.
See “Pitkin’s History,” vol. i. pp. 11-31.]
l 
[ See the work entitled “Historical Collection of State Papers and other
authentic Documents intended as materials for a History of the United States of
America, by Ebenezer Hasard. Philadelphia, 1792,” for a great number of
documents relating to the commencement of the colonies, which are valuable from
their contents and their authenticity: amongst them are the various charters
granted by the King of England, and the first acts of the local governments.
See also the analysis of all these charters given by Mr. Story, Judge of the
Supreme Court of the United States, in the Introduction to his
“Commentary on the Constitution of the United States.” It results
from these documents that the principles of representative government and the
external forms of political liberty were introduced into all the colonies at
their origin. These principles were more fully acted upon in the North than in
the South, but they existed everywhere.]
In 1628 *m a charter of this kind was granted by Charles I to the emigrants who
went to form the colony of Massachusetts. But, in general, charters were not
given to the colonies of New England till they had acquired a certain
existence. Plymouth, Providence, New Haven, the State of Connecticut, and that
of Rhode Island *n were founded without the co-operation and almost without the
knowledge of the mother-country. The new settlers did not derive their
incorporation from the seat of the empire, although they did not deny its
supremacy; they constituted a society of their own accord, and it was not till
thirty or forty years afterwards, under Charles II. that their existence was
legally recognized by a royal charter.
m 
[ See “Pitkin’s History,” p, 35. See the “History of
the Colony of Massachusetts Bay,” by Hutchinson, vol. i. p. 9.] [Footnote
n: See “Pitkin’s History,” pp. 42, 47.]
This frequently renders its it difficult to detect the link which connected the
emigrants with the land of their forefathers in studying the earliest
historical and legislative records of New England. They exercised the rights of
sovereignty; they named their magistrates, concluded peace or declared war,
made police regulations, and enacted laws as if their allegiance was due only
to God. *o Nothing can be more curious and, at the same time more instructive,
than the legislation of that period; it is there that the solution of the great
social problem which the United States now present to the world is to be found.
o 
[ The inhabitants of Massachusetts had deviated from the forms which are
preserved in the criminal and civil procedure of England; in 1650 the decrees
of justice were not yet headed by the royal style. See Hutchinson, vol. i. p.
452.]
Amongst these documents we shall notice, as especially characteristic, the code
of laws promulgated by the little State of Connecticut in 1650. *p The
legislators of Connecticut *q begin with the penal laws, and, strange to say,
they borrow their provisions from the text of Holy Writ. “Whosoever shall
worship any other God than the Lord,” says the preamble of the Code,
“shall surely be put to death.” This is followed by ten or twelve
enactments of the same kind, copied verbatim from the books of Exodus,
Leviticus, and Deuteronomy. Blasphemy, sorcery, adultery, *r and rape were
punished with death; an outrage offered by a son to his parents was to be
expiated by the same penalty. The legislation of a rude and half-civilized
people was thus applied to an enlightened and moral community. The consequence
was that the punishment of death was never more frequently prescribed by the
statute, and never more rarely enforced towards the guilty.
p 
[ Code of 1650, p. 28; Hartford, 1830.]
q 
[ See also in “Hutchinson’s History,” vol. i. pp. 435, 456,
the analysis of the penal code adopted in 1648 by the Colony of Massachusetts:
this code is drawn up on the same principles as that of Connecticut.]
r 
[ Adultery was also punished with death by the law of Massachusetts: and
Hutchinson, vol. i. p. 441, says that several persons actually suffered for
this crime. He quotes a curious anecdote on this subject, which occurred in the
year 1663. A married woman had had criminal intercourse with a young man; her
husband died, and she married the lover. Several years had elapsed, when the
public began to suspect the previous intercourse of this couple: they were
thrown into prison, put upon trial, and very narrowly escaped capital
punishment.]
The chief care of the legislators, in this body of penal laws, was the
maintenance of orderly conduct and good morals in the community: they
constantly invaded the domain of conscience, and there was scarcely a sin which
was not subject to magisterial censure. The reader is aware of the rigor with
which these laws punished rape and adultery; intercourse between unmarried
persons was likewise severely repressed. The judge was empowered to inflict a
pecuniary penalty, a whipping, or marriage *s on the misdemeanants; and if the
records of the old courts of New Haven may be believed, prosecutions of this
kind were not unfrequent. We find a sentence bearing date the first of May,
1660, inflicting a fine and reprimand on a young woman who was accused of using
improper language, and of allowing herself to be kissed. *t The Code of 1650
abounds in preventive measures. It punishes idleness and drunkenness with
severity. *u Innkeepers are forbidden to furnish more than a certain quantity
of liquor to each consumer; and simple lying, whenever it may be injurious, *v
is checked by a fine or a flogging. In other places, the legislator, entirely
forgetting the great principles of religious toleration which he had himself
upheld in Europe, renders attendance on divine service compulsory, *w and goes
so far as to visit with severe punishment, ** and even with death, the
Christians who chose to worship God according to a ritual differing from his
own. *x Sometimes indeed the zeal of his enactments induces him to descend to
the most frivolous particulars: thus a law is to be found in the same Code
which prohibits the use of tobacco. *y It must not be forgotten that these
fantastical and vexatious laws were not imposed by authority, but that they
were freely voted by all the persons interested, and that the manners of the
community were even more austere and more puritanical than the laws. In 1649 a
solemn association was formed in Boston to check the worldly luxury of long
hair. *z
s 
[ Code of 1650, p. 48. It seems sometimes to have happened that the judges
superadded these punishments to each other, as is seen in a sentence pronounced
in 1643 (p. 114, “New Haven Antiquities”), by which Margaret
Bedford, convicted of loose conduct, was condemned to be whipped, and
afterwards to marry Nicholas Jemmings, her accomplice.]

the law against the Quakers, passed on October 14, 1656: “Whereas,”
says the preamble, “an accursed race of heretics called Quakers has
sprung up,” etc. The clauses of the statute inflict a heavy fine on all
captains of ships who should import Quakers into the country. The Quakers who
may be found there shall be whipped and imprisoned with hard labor. Those
members of the sect who should defend their opinions shall be first fined, then
imprisoned, and finally driven out of the province.—“Historical

These errors are no doubt discreditable to human reason; they attest the
inferiority of our nature, which is incapable of laying firm hold upon what is
true and just, and is often reduced to the alternative of two excesses. In
strict connection with this penal legislation, which bears such striking marks
of a narrow sectarian spirit, and of those religious passions which had been
warmed by persecution and were still fermenting among the people, a body of
political laws is to be found, which, though written two hundred years ago, is
still ahead of the liberties of our age. The general principles which are the
groundwork of modern constitutions—principles which were imperfectly
known in Europe, and not completely triumphant even in Great Britain, in the
seventeenth century—were all recognized and determined by the laws of New
England: the intervention of the people in public affairs, the free voting of
taxes, the responsibility of authorities, personal liberty, and trial by jury,
were all positively established without discussion. From these fruitful
principles consequences have been derived and applications have been made such
as no nation in Europe has yet ventured to attempt.
In Connecticut the electoral body consisted, from its origin, of the whole
number of citizens; and this is readily to be understood, *a when we recollect
that this people enjoyed an almost perfect equality of fortune, and a still
greater uniformity of opinions. *b In Connecticut, at this period, all the
executive functionaries were elected, including the Governor of the State. *c
The citizens above the age of sixteen were obliged to bear arms; they formed a
national militia, which appointed its own officers, and was to hold itself at
all times in readiness to march for the defence of the country. *d

[ Constitution of 1638, p. 12.]
In the laws of Connecticut, as well as in all those of New England, we find the
germ and gradual development of that township independence which is the life
and mainspring of American liberty at the present day. The political existence
of the majority of the nations of Europe commenced in the superior ranks of
society, and was gradually and imperfectly communicated to the different
members of the social body. In America, on the other hand, it may be said that
the township was organized before the county, the county before the State, the
State before the Union. In New England townships were completely and
definitively constituted as early as 1650. The independence of the township was
the nucleus round which the local interests, passions, rights, and duties
collected and clung. It gave scope to the activity of a real political life
most thoroughly democratic and republican. The colonies still recognized the
supremacy of the mother-country; monarchy was still the law of the State; but
the republic was already established in every township. The towns named their
own magistrates of every kind, rated themselves, and levied their own taxes. *e
In the parish of New England the law of representation was not adopted, but the
affairs of the community were discussed, as at Athens, in the market-place, by
a general assembly of the citizens.
e 
[ Code of 1650, p. 80.]
In studying the laws which were promulgated at this first era of the American
republics, it is impossible not to be struck by the remarkable acquaintance
with the science of government and the advanced theory of legislation which
they display. The ideas there formed of the duties of society towards its
members are evidently much loftier and more comprehensive than those of the
European legislators at that time: obligations were there imposed which were
elsewhere slighted. In the States of New England, from the first, the condition
of the poor was provided for; *f strict measures were taken for the maintenance
of roads, and surveyors were appointed to attend to them; *g registers were
established in every parish, in which the results of public deliberations, and
the births, deaths, and marriages of the citizens were entered; *h clerks were
directed to keep these registers; *i officers were charged with the
administration of vacant inheritances, and with the arbitration of litigated
landmarks; and many others were created whose chief functions were the
maintenance of public order in the community. *j The law enters into a thousand
useful provisions for a number of social wants which are at present very
inadequately felt in France. [Footnote f: Ibid., p. 78.]
g 
[ Ibid., p. 49.]
h 
[ See “Hutchinson’s History,” vol. i. p. 455.]
i 
[ Code of 1650, p. 86.]
j 
[ Ibid., p. 40.]
But it is by the attention it pays to Public Education that the original
character of American civilization is at once placed in the clearest light.
“It being,” says the law, “one chief project of Satan to keep
men from the knowledge of the Scripture by persuading from the use of tongues,
to the end that learning may not be buried in the graves of our forefathers, in
church and commonwealth, the Lord assisting our endeavors. . . .” *k Here
follow clauses establishing schools in every township, and obliging the
inhabitants, under pain of heavy fines, to support them. Schools of a superior
kind were founded in the same manner in the more populous districts. The
municipal authorities were bound to enforce the sending of children to school
by their parents; they were empowered to inflict fines upon all who refused
compliance; and in case of continued resistance society assumed the place of
the parent, took possession of the child, and deprived the father of those
natural rights which he used to so bad a purpose. The reader will undoubtedly
have remarked the preamble of these enactments: in America religion is the road
to knowledge, and the observance of the divine laws leads man to civil freedom.
k 
[ Ibid., p. 90.]
If, after having cast a rapid glance over the state of American society in
1650, we turn to the condition of Europe, and more especially to that of the
Continent, at the same period, we cannot fail to be struck with astonishment.
On the Continent of Europe, at the beginning of the seventeenth century,
absolute monarchy had everywhere triumphed over the ruins of the oligarchical
and feudal liberties of the Middle Ages. Never were the notions of right more
completely confounded than in the midst of the splendor and literature of
Europe; never was there less political activity among the people; never were
the principles of true freedom less widely circulated; and at that very time
those principles, which were scorned or unknown by the nations of Europe, were
proclaimed in the deserts of the New World, and were accepted as the future
creed of a great people. The boldest theories of the human reason were put into
practice by a community so humble that not a statesman condescended to attend
to it; and a legislation without a precedent was produced offhand by the
imagination of the citizens. In the bosom of this obscure democracy, which had
as yet brought forth neither generals, nor philosophers, nor authors, a man
might stand up in the face of a free people and pronounce the following fine
definition of liberty. *l
l 
[ Mather’s “Magnalia Christi Americana,” vol. ii. p. 13. This
speech was made by Winthrop; he was accused of having committed arbitrary
actions during his magistracy, but after having made the speech of which the
above is a fragment, he was acquitted by acclamation, and from that time
forwards he was always re-elected governor of the State. See Marshal, vol. i.
p. 166.]
“Nor would I have you to mistake in the point of your own liberty. There
is a liberty of a corrupt nature which is effected both by men and beasts to do
what they list, and this liberty is inconsistent with authority, impatient of
all restraint; by this liberty ‘sumus omnes deteriores’: ’tis
the grand enemy of truth and peace, and all the ordinances of God are bent
against it. But there is a civil, a moral, a federal liberty which is the
proper end and object of authority; it is a liberty for that only which is just
and good: for this liberty you are to stand with the hazard of your very lives
and whatsoever crosses it is not authority, but a distemper thereof. This
liberty is maintained in a way of subjection to authority; and the authority
set over you will, in all administrations for your good, be quietly submitted
unto by all but such as have a disposition to shake off the yoke and lose their
true liberty, by their murmuring at the honor and power of authority.”
The remarks I have made will suffice to display the character of Anglo-American
civilization in its true light. It is the result (and this should be constantly
present to the mind of two distinct elements), which in other places have been
in frequent hostility, but which in America have been admirably incorporated
and combined with one another. I allude to the spirit of Religion and the
spirit of Liberty.
The settlers of New England were at the same time ardent sectarians and daring
innovators. Narrow as the limits of some of their religious opinions were, they
were entirely free from political prejudices. Hence arose two tendencies,
distinct but not opposite, which are constantly discernible in the manners as
well as in the laws of the country.
It might be imagined that men who sacrificed their friends, their family, and
their native land to a religious conviction were absorbed in the pursuit of the
intellectual advantages which they purchased at so dear a rate. The energy,
however, with which they strove for the acquirement of wealth, moral enjoyment,
and the comforts as well as liberties of the world, is scarcely inferior to
that with which they devoted themselves to Heaven.
Political principles and all human laws and institutions were moulded and
altered at their pleasure; the barriers of the society in which they were born
were broken down before them; the old principles which had governed the world
for ages were no more; a path without a turn and a field without an horizon
were opened to the exploring and ardent curiosity of man: but at the limits of
the political world he checks his researches, he discreetly lays aside the use
of his most formidable faculties, he no longer consents to doubt or to
innovate, but carefully abstaining from raising the curtain of the sanctuary,
he yields with submissive respect to truths which he will not discuss. Thus, in
the moral world everything is classed, adapted, decided, and foreseen; in the
political world everything is agitated, uncertain, and disputed: in the one is
a passive, though a voluntary, obedience; in the other an independence scornful
of experience and jealous of authority.
These two tendencies, apparently so discrepant, are far from conflicting; they
advance together, and mutually support each other. Religion perceives that
civil liberty affords a noble exercise to the faculties of man, and that the
political world is a field prepared by the Creator for the efforts of the
intelligence. Contented with the freedom and the power which it enjoys in its
own sphere, and with the place which it occupies, the empire of religion is
never more surely established than when it reigns in the hearts of men
unsupported by aught beside its native strength. Religion is no less the
companion of liberty in all its battles and its triumphs; the cradle of its
infancy, and the divine source of its claims. The safeguard of morality is
religion, and morality is the best security of law and the surest pledge of
freedom. *m

Reasons Of Certain Anomalies Which The Laws And Customs Of The Anglo-Americans
Present
Remains of aristocratic institutions in the midst of a complete
democracy—Why?—Distinction carefully to be drawn between what is of
Puritanical and what is of English origin.
The reader is cautioned not to draw too general or too absolute an inference
from what has been said. The social condition, the religion, and the manners of
the first emigrants undoubtedly exercised an immense influence on the destiny
of their new country. Nevertheless they were not in a situation to found a
state of things solely dependent on themselves: no man can entirely shake off
the influence of the past, and the settlers, intentionally or involuntarily,
mingled habits and notions derived from their education and from the traditions
of their country with those habits and notions which were exclusively their
own. To form a judgment on the Anglo-Americans of the present day it is
therefore necessary to distinguish what is of Puritanical and what is of
English origin.
Laws and customs are frequently to be met with in the United States which
contrast strongly with all that surrounds them. These laws seem to be drawn up
in a spirit contrary to the prevailing tenor of the American legislation; and
these customs are no less opposed to the tone of society. If the English
colonies had been founded in an age of darkness, or if their origin was already
lost in the lapse of years, the problem would be insoluble.
I shall quote a single example to illustrate what I advance. The civil and
criminal procedure of the Americans has only two means of
action—committal and bail. The first measure taken by the magistrate is
to exact security from the defendant, or, in case of refusal, to incarcerate
him: the ground of the accusation and the importance of the charges against him
are then discussed. It is evident that a legislation of this kind is hostile to
the poor man, and favorable only to the rich. The poor man has not always a
security to produce, even in a civil cause; and if he is obliged to wait for
justice in prison, he is speedily reduced to distress. The wealthy individual,
on the contrary, always escapes imprisonment in civil causes; nay, more, he may
readily elude the punishment which awaits him for a delinquency by breaking his
bail. So that all the penalties of the law are, for him, reducible to fines. *n
Nothing can be more aristocratic than this system of legislation. Yet in
America it is the poor who make the law, and they usually reserve the greatest
social advantages to themselves. The explanation of the phenomenon is to be
found in England; the laws of which I speak are English, *o and the Americans
have retained them, however repugnant they may be to the tenor of their
legislation and the mass of their ideas. Next to its habits, the thing which a
nation is least apt to change is its civil legislation. Civil laws are only
familiarly known to legal men, whose direct interest it is to maintain them as
they are, whether good or bad, simply because they themselves are conversant
with them. The body of the nation is scarcely acquainted with them; it merely
perceives their action in particular cases; but it has some difficulty in
seizing their tendency, and obeys them without premeditation. I have quoted one
instance where it would have been easy to adduce a great number of others. The
surface of American society is, if I may use the expression, covered with a
layer of democracy, from beneath which the old aristocratic colors sometimes
peep.

[ Crimes no doubt exist for which bail is inadmissible, but they are few in
number.]

[ See Blackstone; and Delolme, book I chap. x.]
A Social condition is commonly the result of circumstances, sometimes of laws,
oftener still of these two causes united; but wherever it exists, it may justly
be considered as the source of almost all the laws, the usages, and the ideas
which regulate the conduct of nations; whatever it does not produce it
modifies. It is therefore necessary, if we would become acquainted with the
legislation and the manners of a nation, to begin by the study of its social
condition.
The Striking Characteristic Of The Social Condition Of The Anglo-Americans In
Its Essential Democracy.
The first emigrants of New England—Their equality—Aristocratic laws
introduced in the South—Period of the Revolution—Change in the law
of descent—Effects produced by this change—Democracy carried to its
utmost limits in the new States of the West—Equality of education.
Many important observations suggest themselves upon the social condition of the
Anglo-Americans, but there is one which takes precedence of all the rest. The
social condition of the Americans is eminently democratic; this was its
character at the foundation of the Colonies, and is still more strongly marked
at the present day. I have stated in the preceding chapter that great equality
existed among the emigrants who settled on the shores of New England. The germ
of aristocracy was never planted in that part of the Union. The only influence
which obtained there was that of intellect; the people were used to reverence
certain names as the emblems of knowledge and virtue. Some of their
fellow-citizens acquired a power over the rest which might truly have been
called aristocratic, if it had been capable of transmission from father to son.
This was the state of things to the east of the Hudson: to the south-west of
that river, and in the direction of the Floridas, the case was different. In
most of the States situated to the south-west of the Hudson some great English
proprietors had settled, who had imported with them aristocratic principles and
the English law of descent. I have explained the reasons why it was impossible
ever to establish a powerful aristocracy in America; these reasons existed with
less force to the south-west of the Hudson. In the South, one man, aided by
slaves, could cultivate a great extent of country: it was therefore common to
see rich landed proprietors. But their influence was not altogether
aristocratic as that term is understood in Europe, since they possessed no
privileges; and the cultivation of their estates being carried on by slaves,
they had no tenants depending on them, and consequently no patronage. Still,
the great proprietors south of the Hudson constituted a superior class, having
ideas and tastes of its own, and forming the centre of political action. This
kind of aristocracy sympathized with the body of the people, whose passions and
interests it easily embraced; but it was too weak and too short-lived to excite
either love or hatred for itself. This was the class which headed the
insurrection in the South, and furnished the best leaders of the American
revolution.
At the period of which we are now speaking society was shaken to its centre:
the people, in whose name the struggle had taken place, conceived the desire of
exercising the authority which it had acquired; its democratic tendencies were
awakened; and having thrown off the yoke of the mother-country, it aspired to
independence of every kind. The influence of individuals gradually ceased to be
felt, and custom and law united together to produce the same result.
But the law of descent was the last step to equality. I am surprised that
ancient and modern jurists have not attributed to this law a greater influence
on human affairs. *a It is true that these laws belong to civil affairs; but
they ought nevertheless to be placed at the head of all political institutions;
for, whilst political laws are only the symbol of a nation’s condition,
they exercise an incredible influence upon its social state. They have,
moreover, a sure and uniform manner of operating upon society, affecting, as it
were, generations yet unborn.
a 
[ I understand by the law of descent all those laws whose principal object is
to regulate the distribution of property after the death of its owner. The law
of entail is of this number; it certainly prevents the owner from disposing of
his possessions before his death; but this is solely with the view of
preserving them entire for the heir. The principal object, therefore, of the
law of entail is to regulate the descent of property after the death of its
owner: its other provisions are merely means to this end.]
Through their means man acquires a kind of preternatural power over the future
lot of his fellow-creatures. When the legislator has regulated the law of
inheritance, he may rest from his labor. The machine once put in motion will go
on for ages, and advance, as if self-guided, towards a given point. When framed
in a particular manner, this law unites, draws together, and vests property and
power in a few hands: its tendency is clearly aristocratic. On opposite
principles its action is still more rapid; it divides, distributes, and
disperses both property and power. Alarmed by the rapidity of its progress,
those who despair of arresting its motion endeavor to obstruct it by
difficulties and impediments; they vainly seek to counteract its effect by
contrary efforts; but it gradually reduces or destroys every obstacle, until by
its incessant activity the bulwarks of the influence of wealth are ground down
to the fine and shifting sand which is the basis of democracy. When the law of
inheritance permits, still more when it decrees, the equal division of a
father’s property amongst all his children, its effects are of two kinds:
it is important to distinguish them from each other, although they tend to the
same end.
In virtue of the law of partible inheritance, the death of every proprietor
brings about a kind of revolution in property; not only do his possessions
change hands, but their very nature is altered, since they are parcelled into
shares, which become smaller and smaller at each division. This is the direct
and, as it were, the physical effect of the law. It follows, then, that in
countries where equality of inheritance is established by law, property, and
especially landed property, must have a tendency to perpetual diminution. The
effects, however, of such legislation would only be perceptible after a lapse
of time, if the law was abandoned to its own working; for supposing the family
to consist of two children (and in a country people as France is the average
number is not above three), these children, sharing amongst them the fortune of
both parents, would not be poorer than their father or mother.
But the law of equal division exercises its influence not merely upon the
property itself, but it affects the minds of the heirs, and brings their
passions into play. These indirect consequences tend powerfully to the
destruction of large fortunes, and especially of large domains. Among nations
whose law of descent is founded upon the right of primogeniture landed estates
often pass from generation to generation without undergoing division, the
consequence of which is that family feeling is to a certain degree incorporated
with the estate. The family represents the estate, the estate the family; whose
name, together with its origin, its glory, its power, and its virtues, is thus
perpetuated in an imperishable memorial of the past and a sure pledge of the
future.
When the equal partition of property is established by law, the intimate
connection is destroyed between family feeling and the preservation of the
paternal estate; the property ceases to represent the family; for as it must
inevitably be divided after one or two generations, it has evidently a constant
tendency to diminish, and must in the end be completely dispersed. The sons of
the great landed proprietor, if they are few in number, or if fortune befriends
them, may indeed entertain the hope of being as wealthy as their father, but
not that of possessing the same property as he did; the riches must necessarily
be composed of elements different from his.
Now, from the moment that you divest the landowner of that interest in the
preservation of his estate which he derives from association, from tradition,
and from family pride, you may be certain that sooner or later he will dispose
of it; for there is a strong pecuniary interest in favor of selling, as
floating capital produces higher interest than real property, and is more
readily available to gratify the passions of the moment.
Great landed estates which have once been divided never come together again;
for the small proprietor draws from his land a better revenue, in proportion,
than the large owner does from his, and of course he sells it at a higher rate.
*b The calculations of gain, therefore, which decide the rich man to sell his
domain will still more powerfully influence him against buying small estates to
unite them into a large one.
b 
[ I do not mean to say that the small proprietor cultivates his land better,
but he cultivates it with more ardor and care; so that he makes up by his labor
for his want of skill.]
What is called family pride is often founded upon an illusion of self-love. A
man wishes to perpetuate and immortalize himself, as it were, in his
great-grandchildren. Where the esprit de famille ceases to act individual
selfishness comes into play. When the idea of family becomes vague,
indeterminate, and uncertain, a man thinks of his present convenience; he
provides for the establishment of his succeeding generation, and no more.
Either a man gives up the idea of perpetuating his family, or at any rate he
seeks to accomplish it by other means than that of a landed estate. Thus not
only does the law of partible inheritance render it difficult for families to
preserve their ancestral domains entire, but it deprives them of the
inclination to attempt it, and compels them in some measure to co-operate with
the law in their own extinction.
The law of equal distribution proceeds by two methods: by acting upon things,
it acts upon persons; by influencing persons, it affects things. By these means
the law succeeds in striking at the root of landed property, and dispersing
rapidly both families and fortunes. *c
c 
[ Land being the most stable kind of property, we find, from time to time, rich
individuals who are disposed to make great sacrifices in order to obtain it,
and who willingly forfeit a considerable part of their income to make sure of
the rest. But these are accidental cases. The preference for landed property is
no longer found habitually in any class but among the poor. The small
landowner, who has less information, less imagination, and fewer passions than
the great one, is generally occupied with the desire of increasing his estate:
and it often happens that by inheritance, by marriage, or by the chances of
trade, he is gradually furnished with the means. Thus, to balance the tendency
which leads men to divide their estates, there exists another, which incites
them to add to them. This tendency, which is sufficient to prevent estates from
being divided ad infinitum, is not strong enough to create great territorial
possessions, certainly not to keep them up in the same family.]
Most certainly it is not for us Frenchmen of the nineteenth century, who daily
witness the political and social changes which the law of partition is bringing
to pass, to question its influence. It is perpetually conspicuous in our
country, overthrowing the walls of our dwellings and removing the landmarks of
our fields. But although it has produced great effects in France, much still
remains for it to do. Our recollections, opinions, and habits present powerful
obstacles to its progress.
In the United States it has nearly completed its work of destruction, and there
we can best study its results. The English laws concerning the transmission of
property were abolished in almost all the States at the time of the Revolution.
The law of entail was so modified as not to interrupt the free circulation of
property. *d The first generation having passed away, estates began to be
parcelled out, and the change became more and more rapid with the progress of
time. At this moment, after a lapse of a little more than sixty years, the
aspect of society is totally altered; the families of the great landed
proprietors are almost all commingled with the general mass. In the State of
New York, which formerly contained many of these, there are but two who still
keep their heads above the stream, and they must shortly disappear. The sons of
these opulent citizens are become merchants, lawyers, or physicians. Most of
them have lapsed into obscurity. The last trace of hereditary ranks and
distinctions is destroyed—the law of partition has reduced all to one
level. [Footnote d: See Appendix, G.]
I do not mean that there is any deficiency of wealthy individuals in the United
States; I know of no country, indeed, where the love of money has taken
stronger hold on the affections of men, and where the profounder contempt is
expressed for the theory of the permanent equality of property. But wealth
circulates with inconceivable rapidity, and experience shows that it is rare to
find two succeeding generations in the full enjoyment of it.
This picture, which may perhaps be thought to be overcharged, still gives a
very imperfect idea of what is taking place in the new States of the West and
South-west. At the end of the last century a few bold adventurers began to
penetrate into the valleys of the Mississippi, and the mass of the population
very soon began to move in that direction: communities unheard of till then
were seen to emerge from the wilds: States whose names were not in existence a
few years before claimed their place in the American Union; and in the Western
settlements we may behold democracy arrived at its utmost extreme. In these
States, founded off-hand, and, as it were, by chance, the inhabitants are but
of yesterday. Scarcely known to one another, the nearest neighbors are ignorant
of each other’s history. In this part of the American continent,
therefore, the population has not experienced the influence of great names and
great wealth, nor even that of the natural aristocracy of knowledge and virtue.
None are there to wield that respectable power which men willingly grant to the
remembrance of a life spent in doing good before their eyes. The new States of
the West are already inhabited, but society has no existence among them. *e
e 
[ This may have been true in 1832, but is not so in 1874, when great cities
like Chicago and San Francisco have sprung up in the Western States. But as yet
the Western States exert no powerful influence on American
society.—-Translator’s Note.]
It is not only the fortunes of men which are equal in America; even their
requirements partake in some degree of the same uniformity. I do not believe
that there is a country in the world where, in proportion to the population,
there are so few uninstructed and at the same time so few learned individuals.
Primary instruction is within the reach of everybody; superior instruction is
scarcely to be obtained by any. This is not surprising; it is in fact the
necessary consequence of what we have advanced above. Almost all the Americans
are in easy circumstances, and can therefore obtain the first elements of human
knowledge.
In America there are comparatively few who are rich enough to live without a
profession. Every profession requires an apprenticeship, which limits the time
of instruction to the early years of life. At fifteen they enter upon their
calling, and thus their education ends at the age when ours begins. Whatever is
done afterwards is with a view to some special and lucrative object; a science
is taken up as a matter of business, and the only branch of it which is
attended to is such as admits of an immediate practical application. In America
most of the rich men were formerly poor; most of those who now enjoy leisure
were absorbed in business during their youth; the consequence of which is, that
when they might have had a taste for study they had no time for it, and when
time is at their disposal they have no longer the inclination.
There is no class, then, in America, in which the taste for intellectual
pleasures is transmitted with hereditary fortune and leisure, and by which the
labors of the intellect are held in honor. Accordingly there is an equal want
of the desire and the power of application to these objects.
A middle standard is fixed in America for human knowledge. All approach as near
to it as they can; some as they rise, others as they descend. Of course, an
immense multitude of persons are to be found who entertain the same number of
ideas on religion, history, science, political economy, legislation, and
government. The gifts of intellect proceed directly from God, and man cannot
prevent their unequal distribution. But in consequence of the state of things
which we have here represented it happens that, although the capacities of men
are widely different, as the Creator has doubtless intended they should be,
they are submitted to the same method of treatment.
In America the aristocratic element has always been feeble from its birth; and
if at the present day it is not actually destroyed, it is at any rate so
completely disabled that we can scarcely assign to it any degree of influence
in the course of affairs. The democratic principle, on the contrary, has gained
so much strength by time, by events, and by legislation, as to have become not
only predominant but all-powerful. There is no family or corporate authority,
and it is rare to find even the influence of individual character enjoy any
durability.
America, then, exhibits in her social state a most extraordinary phenomenon.
Men are there seen on a greater equality in point of fortune and intellect, or,
in other words, more equal in their strength, than in any other country of the
world, or in any age of which history has preserved the remembrance.
Political Consequences Of The Social Condition Of The Anglo-Americans
The political consequences of such a social condition as this are easily
deducible. It is impossible to believe that equality will not eventually find
its way into the political world as it does everywhere else. To conceive of men
remaining forever unequal upon one single point, yet equal on all others, is
impossible; they must come in the end to be equal upon all. Now I know of only
two methods of establishing equality in the political world; every citizen must
be put in possession of his rights, or rights must be granted to no one. For
nations which are arrived at the same stage of social existence as the
Anglo-Americans, it is therefore very difficult to discover a medium between
the sovereignty of all and the absolute power of one man: and it would be vain
to deny that the social condition which I have been describing is equally
liable to each of these consequences.
There is, in fact, a manly and lawful passion for equality which excites men to
wish all to be powerful and honored. This passion tends to elevate the humble
to the rank of the great; but there exists also in the human heart a depraved
taste for equality, which impels the weak to attempt to lower the powerful to
their own level, and reduces men to prefer equality in slavery to inequality
with freedom. Not that those nations whose social condition is democratic
naturally despise liberty; on the contrary, they have an instinctive love of
it. But liberty is not the chief and constant object of their desires; equality
is their idol: they make rapid and sudden efforts to obtain liberty, and if
they miss their aim resign themselves to their disappointment; but nothing can
satisfy them except equality, and rather than lose it they resolve to perish.
On the other hand, in a State where the citizens are nearly on an equality, it
becomes difficult for them to preserve their independence against the
aggressions of power. No one among them being strong enough to engage in the
struggle with advantage, nothing but a general combination can protect their
liberty. And such a union is not always to be found.
From the same social position, then, nations may derive one or the other of two
great political results; these results are extremely different from each other,
but they may both proceed from the same cause.
The Anglo-Americans are the first nations who, having been exposed to this
formidable alternative, have been happy enough to escape the dominion of
absolute power. They have been allowed by their circumstances, their origin,
their intelligence, and especially by their moral feeling, to establish and
maintain the sovereignty of the people.
It predominates over the whole of society in America—Application made of
this principle by the Americans even before their Revolution—Development
given to it by that Revolution—Gradual and irresistible extension of the
elective qualification.
The Principle Of The Sovereignty Of The People In America
Whenever the political laws of the United States are to be discussed, it is
with the doctrine of the sovereignty of the people that we must begin. The
principle of the sovereignty of the people, which is to be found, more or less,
at the bottom of almost all human institutions, generally remains concealed
from view. It is obeyed without being recognized, or if for a moment it be
brought to light, it is hastily cast back into the gloom of the sanctuary.
“The will of the nation” is one of those expressions which have
been most profusely abused by the wily and the despotic of every age. To the
eyes of some it has been represented by the venal suffrages of a few of the
satellites of power; to others by the votes of a timid or an interested
minority; and some have even discovered it in the silence of a people, on the
supposition that the fact of submission established the right of command.
In America the principle of the sovereignty of the people is not either barren
or concealed, as it is with some other nations; it is recognized by the customs
and proclaimed by the laws; it spreads freely, and arrives without impediment
at its most remote consequences. If there be a country in the world where the
doctrine of the sovereignty of the people can be fairly appreciated, where it
can be studied in its application to the affairs of society, and where its
dangers and its advantages may be foreseen, that country is assuredly America.
I have already observed that, from their origin, the sovereignty of the people
was the fundamental principle of the greater number of British colonies in
America. It was far, however, from then exercising as much influence on the
government of society as it now does. Two obstacles, the one external, the
other internal, checked its invasive progress. It could not ostensibly disclose
itself in the laws of colonies which were still constrained to obey the
mother-country: it was therefore obliged to spread secretly, and to gain ground
in the provincial assemblies, and especially in the townships.
American society was not yet prepared to adopt it with all its consequences.
The intelligence of New England, and the wealth of the country to the south of
the Hudson (as I have shown in the preceding chapter), long exercised a sort of
aristocratic influence, which tended to retain the exercise of social authority
in the hands of a few. The public functionaries were not universally elected,
and the citizens were not all of them electors. The electoral franchise was
everywhere placed within certain limits, and made dependent on a certain
qualification, which was exceedingly low in the North and more considerable in
the South.
The American revolution broke out, and the doctrine of the sovereignty of the
people, which had been nurtured in the townships and municipalities, took
possession of the State: every class was enlisted in its cause; battles were
fought, and victories obtained for it, until it became the law of laws.
A no less rapid change was effected in the interior of society, where the law
of descent completed the abolition of local influences.
At the very time when this consequence of the laws and of the revolution was
apparent to every eye, victory was irrevocably pronounced in favor of the
democratic cause. All power was, in fact, in its hands, and resistance was no
longer possible. The higher orders submitted without a murmur and without a
struggle to an evil which was thenceforth inevitable. The ordinary fate of
falling powers awaited them; each of their several members followed his own
interests; and as it was impossible to wring the power from the hands of a
people which they did not detest sufficiently to brave, their only aim was to
secure its good-will at any price. The most democratic laws were consequently
voted by the very men whose interests they impaired; and thus, although the
higher classes did not excite the passions of the people against their order,
they accelerated the triumph of the new state of things; so that by a singular
change the democratic impulse was found to be most irresistible in the very
States where the aristocracy had the firmest hold. The State of Maryland, which
had been founded by men of rank, was the first to proclaim universal suffrage,
and to introduce the most democratic forms into the conduct of its government.
When a nation modifies the elective qualification, it may easily be foreseen
that sooner or later that qualification will be entirely abolished. There is no
more invariable rule in the history of society: the further electoral rights
are extended, the greater is the need of extending them; for after each
concession the strength of the democracy increases, and its demands increase
with its strength. The ambition of those who are below the appointed rate is
irritated in exact proportion to the great number of those who are above it.
The exception at last becomes the rule, concession follows concession, and no
stop can be made short of universal suffrage.
At the present day the principle of the sovereignty of the people has acquired,
in the United States, all the practical development which the imagination can
conceive. It is unencumbered by those fictions which have been thrown over it
in other countries, and it appears in every possible form according to the
exigency of the occasion. Sometimes the laws are made by the people in a body,
as at Athens; and sometimes its representatives, chosen by universal suffrage,
transact business in its name, and almost under its immediate control.
In some countries a power exists which, though it is in a degree foreign to the
social body, directs it, and forces it to pursue a certain track. In others the
ruling force is divided, being partly within and partly without the ranks of
the people. But nothing of the kind is to be seen in the United States; there
society governs itself for itself. All power centres in its bosom; and scarcely
an individual is to be meet with who would venture to conceive, or, still less,
to express, the idea of seeking it elsewhere. The nation participates in the
making of its laws by the choice of its legislators, and in the execution of
them by the choice of the agents of the executive government; it may almost be
said to govern itself, so feeble and so restricted is the share left to the
administration, so little do the authorities forget their popular origin and
the power from which they emanate. *a [Footnote a: See Appendix, H.]
Necessity Of Examining The Condition Of The States Before That Of The Union At
Large.
It is proposed to examine in the following chapter what is the form of
government established in America on the principle of the sovereignty of the
people; what are its resources, its hindrances, its advantages, and its
dangers. The first difficulty which presents itself arises from the complex
nature of the constitution of the United States, which consists of two distinct
social structures, connected and, as it were, encased one within the other; two
governments, completely separate and almost independent, the one fulfilling the
ordinary duties and responding to the daily and indefinite calls of a
community, the other circumscribed within certain limits, and only exercising
an exceptional authority over the general interests of the country. In short,
there are twenty-four small sovereign nations, whose agglomeration constitutes
the body of the Union. To examine the Union before we have studied the States
would be to adopt a method filled with obstacles. The form of the Federal
Government of the United States was the last which was adopted; and it is in
fact nothing more than a modification or a summary of those republican
principles which were current in the whole community before it existed, and
independently of its existence. Moreover, the Federal Government is, as I have
just observed, the exception; the Government of the States is the rule. The
author who should attempt to exhibit the picture as a whole before he had
explained its details would necessarily fall into obscurity and repetition.
The great political principles which govern American society at this day
undoubtedly took their origin and their growth in the State. It is therefore
necessary to become acquainted with the State in order to possess a clue to the
remainder. The States which at present compose the American Union all present
the same features, as far as regards the external aspect of their institutions.
Their political or administrative existence is centred in three focuses of
action, which may not inaptly be compared to the different nervous centres
which convey motion to the human body. The township is the lowest in order,
then the county, and lastly the State; and I propose to devote the following
chapter to the examination of these three divisions.
The American System Of Townships And Municipal Bodies
Why the Author begins the examination of the political institutions with the
township—Its existence in all nations—Difficulty of establishing
and preserving municipal independence—Its importance—Why the Author
has selected the township system of New England as the main topic of his
discussion.
It is not undesignedly that I begin this subject with the Township. The village
or township is the only association which is so perfectly natural that wherever
a number of men are collected it seems to constitute itself.
The town, or tithing, as the smallest division of a community, must necessarily
exist in all nations, whatever their laws and customs may be: if man makes
monarchies and establishes republics, the first association of mankind seems
constituted by the hand of God. But although the existence of the township is
coeval with that of man, its liberties are not the less rarely respected and
easily destroyed. A nation is always able to establish great political
assemblies, because it habitually contains a certain number of individuals
fitted by their talents, if not by their habits, for the direction of affairs.
The township is, on the contrary, composed of coarser materials, which are less
easily fashioned by the legislator. The difficulties which attend the
consolidation of its independence rather augment than diminish with the
increasing enlightenment of the people. A highly civilized community spurns the
attempts of a local independence, is disgusted at its numerous blunders, and is
apt to despair of success before the experiment is completed. Again, no
immunities are so ill protected from the encroachments of the supreme power as
those of municipal bodies in general: they are unable to struggle,
single-handed, against a strong or an enterprising government, and they cannot
defend their cause with success unless it be identified with the customs of the
nation and supported by public opinion. Thus until the independence of
townships is amalgamated with the manners of a people it is easily destroyed,
and it is only after a long existence in the laws that it can be thus
amalgamated. Municipal freedom is not the fruit of human device; it is rarely
created; but it is, as it were, secretly and spontaneously engendered in the
midst of a semi-barbarous state of society. The constant action of the laws and
the national habits, peculiar circumstances, and above all time, may
consolidate it; but there is certainly no nation on the continent of Europe
which has experienced its advantages. Nevertheless local assemblies of citizens
constitute the strength of free nations. Town-meetings are to liberty what
primary schools are to science; they bring it within the people’s reach,
they teach men how to use and how to enjoy it. A nation may establish a system
of free government, but without the spirit of municipal institutions it cannot
have the spirit of liberty. The transient passions and the interests of an
hour, or the chance of circumstances, may have created the external forms of
independence; but the despotic tendency which has been repelled will, sooner or
later, inevitably reappear on the surface.
In order to explain to the reader the general principles on which the political
organization of the counties and townships of the United States rests, I have
thought it expedient to choose one of the States of New England as an example,
to examine the mechanism of its constitution, and then to cast a general glance
over the country. The township and the county are not organized in the same
manner in every part of the Union; it is, however, easy to perceive that the
same principles have guided the formation of both of them throughout the Union.
I am inclined to believe that these principles have been carried further in New
England than elsewhere, and consequently that they offer greater facilities to
the observations of a stranger. The institutions of New England form a complete
and regular whole; they have received the sanction of time, they have the
support of the laws, and the still stronger support of the manners of the
community, over which they exercise the most prodigious influence; they
consequently deserve our attention on every account.
Limits Of The Township
The township of New England is a division which stands between the commune and
the canton of France, and which corresponds in general to the English tithing,
or town. Its average population is from two to three thousand; *a so that, on
the one hand, the interests of its inhabitants are not likely to conflict, and,
on the other, men capable of conducting its affairs are always to be found
among its citizens.
a 
[ In 1830 there were 305 townships in the State of Massachusetts, and 610,014
inhabitants, which gives an average of about 2,000 inhabitants to each
township.]
Authorities Of The Township In New England
The people the source of all power here as elsewhere—Manages its own
affairs—No corporation—The greater part of the authority vested in
the hands of the Selectmen—How the Selectmen
act—Town-meeting—Enumeration of the public officers of the
township—Obligatory and remunerated functions.
In the township, as well as everywhere else, the people is the only source of
power; but in no stage of government does the body of citizens exercise a more
immediate influence. In America the people is a master whose exigencies demand
obedience to the utmost limits of possibility.
In New England the majority acts by representatives in the conduct of the
public business of the State; but if such an arrangement be necessary in
general affairs, in the townships, where the legislative and administrative
action of the government is in more immediate contact with the subject, the
system of representation is not adopted. There is no corporation; but the body
of electors, after having designated its magistrates, directs them in
everything that exceeds the simple and ordinary executive business of the
State. *b
b 
[ The same rules are not applicable to the great towns, which generally have a
mayor, and a corporation divided into two bodies; this, however, is an
exception which requires the sanction of a law.—See the Act of February
22, 1822, for appointing the authorities of the city of Boston. It frequently
happens that small towns as well as cities are subject to a peculiar
administration. In 1832, 104 townships in the State of New York were governed
in this manner.—Williams’ Register.]
This state of things is so contrary to our ideas, and so different from our
customs, that it is necessary for me to adduce some examples to explain it
thoroughly.
The public duties in the township are extremely numerous and minutely divided,
as we shall see further on; but the larger proportion of administrative power
is vested in the hands of a small number of individuals, called “the
Selectmen.” *c The general laws of the State impose a certain number of
obligations on the selectmen, which they may fulfil without the authorization
of the body they represent, but which they can only neglect on their own
responsibility. The law of the State obliges them, for instance, to draw up the
list of electors in their townships; and if they omit this part of their
functions, they are guilty of a misdemeanor. In all the affairs, however, which
are determined by the town-meeting, the selectmen are the organs of the popular
mandate, as in France the Maire executes the decree of the municipal council.
They usually act upon their own responsibility, and merely put in practice
principles which have been previously recognized by the majority. But if any
change is to be introduced in the existing state of things, or if they wish to
undertake any new enterprise, they are obliged to refer to the source of their
power. If, for instance, a school is to be established, the selectmen convoke
the whole body of the electors on a certain day at an appointed place; they
explain the urgency of the case; they give their opinion on the means of
satisfying it, on the probable expense, and the site which seems to be most
favorable. The meeting is consulted on these several points; it adopts the
principle, marks out the site, votes the rate, and confides the execution of
its resolution to the selectmen.
c 
[ Three selectmen are appointed in the small townships, and nine in the large
ones. See “The Town-Officer,” p. 186. See also the principal laws
of the State of Massachusetts relative to the selectmen:
Act of February 20, 1786, vol. i. p. 219; February 24, 1796, vol. i. p. 488;
March 7, 1801, vol. ii. p. 45; June 16, 1795, vol. i. p. 475; March 12, 1808,
vol. ii. p. 186; February 28, 1787, vol. i. p. 302; June 22, 1797, vol. i. p.
539.]
The selectmen have alone the right of calling a town-meeting, but they may be
requested to do so: if ten citizens are desirous of submitting a new project to
the assent of the township, they may demand a general convocation of the
inhabitants; the selectmen are obliged to comply, but they have only the right
of presiding at the meeting. *d
d 
[ See Laws of Massachusetts, vol. i. p. 150, Act of March 25, 1786.]
The selectmen are elected every year in the month of April or of May. The
town-meeting chooses at the same time a number of other municipal magistrates,
who are entrusted with important administrative functions. The assessors rate
the township; the collectors receive the rate. A constable is appointed to keep
the peace, to watch the streets, and to forward the execution of the laws; the
town-clerk records all the town votes, orders, grants, births, deaths, and
marriages; the treasurer keeps the funds; the overseer of the poor performs the
difficult task of superintending the action of the poor-laws; committee-men are
appointed to attend to the schools and to public instruction; and the
road-surveyors, who take care of the greater and lesser thoroughfares of the
township, complete the list of the principal functionaries. They are, however,
still further subdivided; and amongst the municipal officers are to be found
parish commissioners, who audit the expenses of public worship; different
classes of inspectors, some of whom are to direct the citizens in case of fire;
tithing-men, listers, haywards, chimney-viewers, fence-viewers to maintain the
bounds of property, timber-measurers, and sealers of weights and measures. *e
e 
[ All these magistrates actually exist; their different functions are all
detailed in a book called “The Town-Officer,” by Isaac Goodwin,
Worcester, 1827; and in the “Collection of the General Laws of
Massachusetts,” 3 vols., Boston, 1823.]
There are nineteen principal officers in a township. Every inhabitant is
constrained, on the pain of being fined, to undertake these different
functions; which, however, are almost all paid, in order that the poorer
citizens may be able to give up their time without loss. In general the
American system is not to grant a fixed salary to its functionaries. Every
service has its price, and they are remunerated in proportion to what they have
done.
Existence Of The Township
Every one the best judge of his own interest—Corollary of the principle
of the sovereignty of the people—Application of those doctrines in the
townships of America—The township of New England is sovereign in all that
concerns itself alone: subject to the State in all other matters—Bond of
the township and the State—In France the Government lends its agent to
the Commune—In America the reverse occurs.
I have already observed that the principle of the sovereignty of the people
governs the whole political system of the Anglo-Americans. Every page of this
book will afford new instances of the same doctrine. In the nations by which
the sovereignty of the people is recognized every individual possesses an equal
share of power, and participates alike in the government of the State. Every
individual is, therefore, supposed to be as well informed, as virtuous, and as
strong as any of his fellow-citizens. He obeys the government, not because he
is inferior to the authorities which conduct it, or that he is less capable
than his neighbor of governing himself, but because he acknowledges the utility
of an association with his fellow-men, and because he knows that no such
association can exist without a regulating force. If he be a subject in all
that concerns the mutual relations of citizens, he is free and responsible to
God alone for all that concerns himself. Hence arises the maxim that every one
is the best and the sole judge of his own private interest, and that society
has no right to control a man’s actions, unless they are prejudicial to
the common weal, or unless the common weal demands his co-operation. This
doctrine is universally admitted in the United States. I shall hereafter
examine the general influence which it exercises on the ordinary actions of
life; I am now speaking of the nature of municipal bodies.
The township, taken as a whole, and in relation to the government of the
country, may be looked upon as an individual to whom the theory I have just
alluded to is applied. Municipal independence is therefore a natural
consequence of the principle of the sovereignty of the people in the United
States: all the American republics recognize it more or less; but circumstances
have peculiarly favored its growth in New England.
In this part of the Union the impulsion of political activity was given in the
townships; and it may almost be said that each of them originally formed an
independent nation. When the Kings of England asserted their supremacy, they
were contented to assume the central power of the State. The townships of New
England remained as they were before; and although they are now subject to the
State, they were at first scarcely dependent upon it. It is important to
remember that they have not been invested with privileges, but that they have,
on the contrary, forfeited a portion of their independence to the State. The
townships are only subordinate to the State in those interests which I shall
term social, as they are common to all the citizens. They are independent in
all that concerns themselves; and amongst the inhabitants of New England I
believe that not a man is to be found who would acknowledge that the State has
any right to interfere in their local interests. The towns of New England buy
and sell, sue or are sued, augment or diminish their rates, without the
slightest opposition on the part of the administrative authority of the State.
They are bound, however, to comply with the demands of the community. If the
State is in need of money, a town can neither give nor withhold the supplies.
If the State projects a road, the township cannot refuse to let it cross its
territory; if a police regulation is made by the State, it must be enforced by
the town. A uniform system of instruction is organized all over the country,
and every town is bound to establish the schools which the law ordains. In
speaking of the administration of the United States I shall have occasion to
point out the means by which the townships are compelled to obey in these
different cases: I here merely show the existence of the obligation. Strict as
this obligation is, the government of the State imposes it in principle only,
and in its performance the township resumes all its independent rights. Thus,
taxes are voted by the State, but they are levied and collected by the
township; the existence of a school is obligatory, but the township builds,
pays, and superintends it. In France the State-collector receives the local
imposts; in America the town-collector receives the taxes of the State. Thus
the French Government lends its agents to the commune; in America the township
is the agent of the Government. This fact alone shows the extent of the
differences which exist between the two nations.
Public Spirit Of The Townships Of New England
How the township of New England wins the affections of its
inhabitants—Difficulty of creating local public spirit in
Europe—The rights and duties of the American township favorable to
it—Characteristics of home in the United States—Manifestations of
public spirit in New England—Its happy effects.
In America, not only do municipal bodies exist, but they are kept alive and
supported by public spirit. The township of New England possesses two
advantages which infallibly secure the attentive interest of mankind, namely,
independence and authority. Its sphere is indeed small and limited, but within
that sphere its action is unrestrained; and its independence gives to it a real
importance which its extent and population may not always ensure.
It is to be remembered that the affections of men generally lie on the side of
authority. Patriotism is not durable in a conquered nation. The New Englander
is attached to his township, not only because he was born in it, but because it
constitutes a social body of which he is a member, and whose government claims
and deserves the exercise of his sagacity. In Europe the absence of local
public spirit is a frequent subject of regret to those who are in power;
everyone agrees that there is no surer guarantee of order and tranquility, and
yet nothing is more difficult to create. If the municipal bodies were made
powerful and independent, the authorities of the nation might be disunited and
the peace of the country endangered. Yet, without power and independence, a
town may contain good subjects, but it can have no active citizens. Another
important fact is that the township of New England is so constituted as to
excite the warmest of human affections, without arousing the ambitious passions
of the heart of man. The officers of the country are not elected, and their
authority is very limited. Even the State is only a second-rate community,
whose tranquil and obscure administration offers no inducement sufficient to
draw men away from the circle of their interests into the turmoil of public
affairs. The federal government confers power and honor on the men who conduct
it; but these individuals can never be very numerous. The high station of the
Presidency can only be reached at an advanced period of life, and the other
federal functionaries are generally men who have been favored by fortune, or
distinguished in some other career. Such cannot be the permanent aim of the
ambitious. But the township serves as a centre for the desire of public esteem,
the want of exciting interests, and the taste for authority and popularity, in
the midst of the ordinary relations of life; and the passions which commonly
embroil society change their character when they find a vent so near the
domestic hearth and the family circle.
In the American States power has been disseminated with admirable skill for the
purpose of interesting the greatest possible number of persons in the common
weal. Independently of the electors who are from time to time called into
action, the body politic is divided into innumerable functionaries and
officers, who all, in their several spheres, represent the same powerful whole
in whose name they act. The local administration thus affords an unfailing
source of profit and interest to a vast number of individuals.
The American system, which divides the local authority among so many citizens,
does not scruple to multiply the functions of the town officers. For in the
United States it is believed, and with truth, that patriotism is a kind of
devotion which is strengthened by ritual observance. In this manner the
activity of the township is continually perceptible; it is daily manifested in
the fulfilment of a duty or the exercise of a right, and a constant though
gentle motion is thus kept up in society which animates without disturbing it.
The American attaches himself to his home as the mountaineer clings to his
hills, because the characteristic features of his country are there more
distinctly marked than elsewhere. The existence of the townships of New England
is in general a happy one. Their government is suited to their tastes, and
chosen by themselves. In the midst of the profound peace and general comfort
which reign in America the commotions of municipal discord are unfrequent. The
conduct of local business is easy. The political education of the people has
long been complete; say rather that it was complete when the people first set
foot upon the soil. In New England no tradition exists of a distinction of
ranks; no portion of the community is tempted to oppress the remainder; and the
abuses which may injure isolated individuals are forgotten in the general
contentment which prevails. If the government is defective (and it would no
doubt be easy to point out its deficiencies), the fact that it really emanates
from those it governs, and that it acts, either ill or well, casts the
protecting spell of a parental pride over its faults. No term of comparison
disturbs the satisfaction of the citizen: England formerly governed the mass of
the colonies, but the people was always sovereign in the township where its
rule is not only an ancient but a primitive state.
The native of New England is attached to his township because it is independent
and free: his co-operation in its affairs ensures his attachment to its
interest; the well-being it affords him secures his affection; and its welfare
is the aim of his ambition and of his future exertions: he takes a part in
every occurrence in the place; he practises the art of government in the small
sphere within his reach; he accustoms himself to those forms which can alone
ensure the steady progress of liberty; he imbibes their spirit; he acquires a
taste for order, comprehends the union or the balance of powers, and collects
clear practical notions on the nature of his duties and the extent of his
rights.
The Counties Of New England
The division of the countries in America has considerable analogy with that of
the arrondissements of France. The limits of the counties are arbitrarily laid
down, and the various districts which they contain have no necessary
connection, no common tradition or natural sympathy; their object is simply to
facilitate the administration of justice.
The extent of the township was too small to contain a system of judicial
institutions; each county has, however, a court of justice, *f a sheriff to
execute its decrees, and a prison for criminals. There are certain wants which
are felt alike by all the townships of a county; it is therefore natural that
they should be satisfied by a central authority. In the State of Massachusetts
this authority is vested in the hands of several magistrates, who are appointed
by the Governor of the State, with the advice *g of his council. *h The
officers of the county have only a limited and occasional authority, which is
applicable to certain predetermined cases. The State and the townships possess
all the power requisite to conduct public business. The budget of the county is
drawn up by its officers, and is voted by the legislature, but there is no
assembly which directly or indirectly represents the county. It has, therefore,
properly speaking, no political existence.
f 
[ See the Act of February 14, 1821, Laws of Massachusetts, vol. i. p. 551.]
g 
[ See the Act of February 20, 1819, Laws of Massachusetts, vol. ii. p. 494.]
h 
[ The council of the Governor is an elective body.] A twofold tendency may be
discerned in the American constitutions, which impels the legislator to
centralize the legislative and to disperse the executive power. The township of
New England has in itself an indestructible element of independence; and this
distinct existence could only be fictitiously introduced into the county, where
its utility has not been felt. But all the townships united have but one
representation, which is the State, the centre of the national authority:
beyond the action of the township and that of the nation, nothing can be said
to exist but the influence of individual exertion.
Administration In New England
Administration not perceived in America—Why?—The Europeans believe
that liberty is promoted by depriving the social authority of some of its
rights; the Americans, by dividing its exercise—Almost all the
administration confined to the township, and divided amongst the
town-officers—No trace of an administrative body to be perceived, either
in the township or above it—The reason of this—How it happens that
the administration of the State is uniform—Who is empowered to enforce
the obedience of the township and the county to the law—The introduction
of judicial power into the administration—Consequence of the extension of
the elective principle to all functionaries—The Justice of the Peace in
New England—By whom appointed—County officer: ensures the
administration of the townships—Court of Sessions—Its
action—Right of inspection and indictment disseminated like the other
administrative functions—Informers encouraged by the division of fines.
Nothing is more striking to an European traveller in the United States than the
absence of what we term the Government, or the Administration. Written laws
exist in America, and one sees that they are daily executed; but although
everything is in motion, the hand which gives the impulse to the social machine
can nowhere be discovered. Nevertheless, as all peoples are obliged to have
recourse to certain grammatical forms, which are the foundation of human
language, in order to express their thoughts; so all communities are obliged to
secure their existence by submitting to a certain dose of authority, without
which they fall a prey to anarchy. This authority may be distributed in several
ways, but it must always exist somewhere.
There are two methods of diminishing the force of authority in a nation: The
first is to weaken the supreme power in its very principle, by forbidding or
preventing society from acting in its own defence under certain circumstances.
To weaken authority in this manner is what is generally termed in Europe to lay
the foundations of freedom. The second manner of diminishing the influence of
authority does not consist in stripping society of any of its rights, nor in
paralyzing its efforts, but in distributing the exercise of its privileges in
various hands, and in multiplying functionaries, to each of whom the degree of
power necessary for him to perform his duty is entrusted. There may be nations
whom this distribution of social powers might lead to anarchy; but in itself it
is not anarchical. The action of authority is indeed thus rendered less
irresistible and less perilous, but it is not totally suppressed.
The revolution of the United States was the result of a mature and dignified
taste for freedom, and not of a vague or ill-defined craving for independence.
It contracted no alliance with the turbulent passions of anarchy; but its
course was marked, on the contrary, by an attachment to whatever was lawful and
orderly.
It was never assumed in the United States that the citizen of a free country
has a right to do whatever he pleases; on the contrary, social obligations were
there imposed upon him more various than anywhere else. No idea was ever
entertained of attacking the principles or of contesting the rights of society;
but the exercise of its authority was divided, to the end that the office might
be powerful and the officer insignificant, and that the community should be at
once regulated and free. In no country in the world does the law hold so
absolute a language as in America, and in no country is the right of applying
it vested in so many hands. The administrative power in the United States
presents nothing either central or hierarchical in its constitution, which
accounts for its passing, unperceived. The power exists, but its representative
is not to be perceived.
We have already seen that the independent townships of New England protect
their own private interests; and the municipal magistrates are the persons to
whom the execution of the laws of the State is most frequently entrusted. *i
Besides the general laws, the State sometimes passes general police
regulations; but more commonly the townships and town officers, conjointly with
justices of the peace, regulate the minor details of social life, according to
the necessities of the different localities, and promulgate such enactments as
concern the health of the community, and the peace as well as morality of the
citizens. *j Lastly, these municipal magistrates provide, of their own accord
and without any delegated powers, for those unforeseen emergencies which
frequently occur in society. *k
i 
[ See “The Town-Officer,” especially at the words Selectmen,
Assessors, Collectors, Schools, Surveyors of Highways. I take one example in a
thousand: the State prohibits travelling on the Sunday; the tything-men, who
are town-officers, are specially charged to keep watch and to execute the law.
See the Laws of Massachusetts, vol. i. p. 410.
The selectmen draw up the lists of electors for the election of the Governor,
and transmit the result of the ballot to the Secretary of the State. See Act of
February 24, 1796: Id., vol. i. p. 488.]
j 
[ Thus, for instance, the selectmen authorize the construction of drains, point
out the proper sites for slaughter-houses and other trades which are a nuisance
to the neighborhood. See the Act of June 7, 1785: Id., vol. i. p. 193.]
k 
[ The selectmen take measures for the security of the public in case of
contagious diseases, conjointly with the justices of the peace. See Act of June
22, 1797, vol. i. p. 539.]
It results from what we have said that in the State of Massachusetts the
administrative authority is almost entirely restricted to the township, *l but
that it is distributed among a great number of individuals. In the French
commune there is properly but one official functionary, namely, the Maire; and
in New England we have seen that there are nineteen. These nineteen
functionaries do not in general depend upon one another. The law carefully
prescribes a circle of action to each of these magistrates; and within that
circle they have an entire right to perform their functions independently of
any other authority. Above the township scarcely any trace of a series of
official dignitaries is to be found. It sometimes happens that the county
officers alter a decision of the townships or town magistrates, *m but in
general the authorities of the county have no right to interfere with the
authorities of the township, *n except in such matters as concern the county.
l 
[ I say almost, for there are various circumstances in the annals of a township
which are regulated by the justice of the peace in his individual capacity, or
by the justices of the peace assembled in the chief town of the county; thus
licenses are granted by the justices. See the Act of February 28, 1787, vol. i.
p. 297.]
m 
[ Thus licenses are only granted to such persons as can produce a certificate
of good conduct from the selectmen. If the selectmen refuse to give the
certificate, the party may appeal to the justices assembled in the Court of
Sessions, and they may grant the license. See Act of March 12, 1808, vol. ii.
p. 186.
The townships have the right to make by-laws, and to enforce them by fines
which are fixed by law; but these by-laws must be approved by the Court of
Sessions. See Act of March 23, 1786, vol. i. p. 254.]
n 
[ In Massachusetts the county magistrates are frequently called upon to
investigate the acts of the town magistrates; but it will be shown further on
that this investigation is a consequence, not of their administrative, but of
their judicial power.]
The magistrates of the township, as well as those of the county, are bound to
communicate their acts to the central government in a very small number of
predetermined cases. *o But the central government is not represented by an
individual whose business it is to publish police regulations and ordinances
enforcing the execution of the laws; to keep up a regular communication with
the officers of the township and the county; to inspect their conduct, to
direct their actions, or to reprimand their faults. There is no point which
serves as a centre to the radii of the administration.
o 
[ The town committees of schools are obliged to make an annual report to the
Secretary of the State on the condition of the school. See Act of March 10,
1827, vol. iii. p. 183.]
What, then, is the uniform plan on which the government is conducted, and how
is the compliance of the counties and their magistrates or the townships and
their officers enforced? In the States of New England the legislative authority
embraces more subjects than it does in France; the legislator penetrates to the
very core of the administration; the law descends to the most minute details;
the same enactment prescribes the principle and the method of its application,
and thus imposes a multitude of strict and rigorously defined obligations on
the secondary functionaries of the State. The consequence of this is that if
all the secondary functionaries of the administration conform to the law,
society in all its branches proceeds with the greatest uniformity: the
difficulty remains of compelling the secondary functionaries of the
administration to conform to the law. It may be affirmed that, in general,
society has only two methods of enforcing the execution of the laws at its
disposal: a discretionary power may be entrusted to a superior functionary of
directing all the others, and of cashiering them in case of disobedience; or
the courts of justice may be authorized to inflict judicial penalties on the
offender: but these two methods are not always available.
The right of directing a civil officer presupposes that of cashiering him if he
does not obey orders, and of rewarding him by promotion if he fulfils his
duties with propriety. But an elected magistrate can neither be cashiered nor
promoted. All elective functions are inalienable until their term is expired.
In fact, the elected magistrate has nothing either to expect or to fear from
his constituents; and when all public offices are filled by ballot there can be
no series of official dignities, because the double right of commanding and of
enforcing obedience can never be vested in the same individual, and because the
power of issuing an order can never be joined to that of inflicting a
punishment or bestowing a reward.
The communities therefore in which the secondary functionaries of the
government are elected are perforce obliged to make great use of judicial
penalties as a means of administration. This is not evident at first sight; for
those in power are apt to look upon the institution of elective functionaries
as one concession, and the subjection of the elected magistrate to the judges
of the land as another. They are equally averse to both these innovations; and
as they are more pressingly solicited to grant the former than the latter, they
accede to the election of the magistrate, and leave him independent of the
judicial power. Nevertheless, the second of these measures is the only thing
that can possibly counterbalance the first; and it will be found that an
elective authority which is not subject to judicial power will, sooner or
later, either elude all control or be destroyed. The courts of justice are the
only possible medium between the central power and the administrative bodies;
they alone can compel the elected functionary to obey, without violating the
rights of the elector. The extension of judicial power in the political world
ought therefore to be in the exact ratio of the extension of elective offices:
if these two institutions do not go hand in hand, the State must fall into
anarchy or into subjection.
It has always been remarked that habits of legal business do not render men apt
to the exercise of administrative authority. The Americans have borrowed from
the English, their fathers, the idea of an institution which is unknown upon
the continent of Europe: I allude to that of the Justices of the Peace. The
Justice of the Peace is a sort of mezzo termine between the magistrate and the
man of the world, between the civil officer and the judge. A justice of the
peace is a well-informed citizen, though he is not necessarily versed in the
knowledge of the laws. His office simply obliges him to execute the police
regulations of society; a task in which good sense and integrity are of more
avail than legal science. The justice introduces into the administration a
certain taste for established forms and publicity, which renders him a most
unserviceable instrument of despotism; and, on the other hand, he is not
blinded by those superstitions which render legal officers unfit members of a
government. The Americans have adopted the system of the English justices of
the peace, but they have deprived it of that aristocratic character which is
discernible in the mother-country. The Governor of Massachusetts *p appoints a
certain number of justices of the peace in every county, whose functions last
seven years. *q He further designates three individuals from amongst the whole
body of justices who form in each county what is called the Court of Sessions.
The justices take a personal share in public business; they are sometimes
entrusted with administrative functions in conjunction with elected officers,
*r they sometimes constitute a tribunal, before which the magistrates summarily
prosecute a refractory citizen, or the citizens inform against the abuses of
the magistrate. But it is in the Court of Sessions that they exercise their
most important functions. This court meets twice a year in the county town; in
Massachusetts it is empowered to enforce the obedience of the greater number *s
of public officers. *t It must be observed, that in the State of Massachusetts
the Court of Sessions is at the same time an administrative body, properly so
called, and a political tribunal. It has been asserted that the county is a
purely administrative division. The Court of Sessions presides over that small
number of affairs which, as they concern several townships, or all the
townships of the county in common, cannot be entrusted to any one of them in
particular. *u In all that concerns county business the duties of the Court of
Sessions are purely administrative; and if in its investigations it
occasionally borrows the forms of judicial procedure, it is only with a view to
its own information, *v or as a guarantee to the community over which it
presides. But when the administration of the township is brought before it, it
always acts as a judicial body, and in some few cases as an official assembly.

[ We shall hereafter learn what a Governor is: I shall content myself with
remarking in this place that he represents the executive power of the whole
State.]

[ See the Constitution of Massachusetts, chap. II. sect. 1. Section 9; chap.
III. Section 3.]
r 
[ Thus, for example, a stranger arrives in a township from a country where a
contagious disease prevails, and he falls ill. Two justices of the peace can,
with the assent of the selectmen, order the sheriff of the county to remove and
take care of him.—Act of June 22, 1797, vol. i. p. 540.
In general the justices interfere in all the important acts of the
administration, and give them a semi-judicial character.] [Footnote s: I say
the greater number, because certain administrative misdemeanors are brought
before ordinary tribunals. If, for instance, a township refuses to make the
necessary expenditure for its schools or to name a school-committee, it is
liable to a heavy fine. But this penalty is pronounced by the Supreme Judicial
Court or the Court of Common Pleas. See Act of March 10, 1827, Laws of
Massachusetts, vol. iii. p. 190. Or when a township neglects to provide the
necessary war-stores.—Act of February 21, 1822: Id., vol. ii. p. 570.]
t 
[ In their individual capacity the justices of the peace take a part in the
business of the counties and townships.] [Footnote u: These affairs may be
brought under the following heads:—1. The erection of prisons and courts
of justice. 2. The county budget, which is afterwards voted by the State. 3.
The distribution of the taxes so voted. 4. Grants of certain patents. 5. The
laying down and repairs of the country roads.]
v 
[ Thus, when a road is under consideration, almost all difficulties are
disposed of by the aid of the jury.]
The first difficulty is to procure the obedience of an authority as entirely
independent of the general laws of the State as the township is. We have stated
that assessors are annually named by the town-meetings to levy the taxes. If a
township attempts to evade the payment of the taxes by neglecting to name its
assessors, the Court of Sessions condemns it to a heavy penalty. *w The fine is
levied on each of the inhabitants; and the sheriff of the county, who is the
officer of justice, executes the mandate. Thus it is that in the United States
the authority of the Government is mysteriously concealed under the forms of a
judicial sentence; and its influence is at the same time fortified by that
irresistible power with which men have invested the formalities of law.
w 
[ See Act of February 20, 1786, Laws of Massachusetts, vol. i. p. 217.]
These proceedings are easy to follow and to understand. The demands made upon a
township are in general plain and accurately defined; they consist in a simple
fact without any complication, or in a principle without its application in
detail. *x But the difficulty increases when it is not the obedience of the
township, but that of the town officers which is to be enforced. All the
reprehensible actions of which a public functionary may be guilty are reducible
to the following heads:
x 
[ There is an indirect method of enforcing the obedience of a township. Suppose
that the funds which the law demands for the maintenance of the roads have not
been voted, the town surveyor is then authorized, ex officio, to levy the
supplies. As he is personally responsible to private individuals for the state
of the roads, and indictable before the Court of Sessions, he is sure to employ
the extraordinary right which the law gives him against the township. Thus by
threatening the officer the Court of Sessions exacts compliance from the town.
See Act of March 5, 1787, Id., vol. i. p. 305.]
He may execute the law without energy or zeal;
He may neglect to execute the law;
He may do what the law enjoins him not to do.
The last two violations of duty can alone come under the cognizance of a
tribunal; a positive and appreciable fact is the indispensable foundation of an
action at law. Thus, if the selectmen omit to fulfil the legal formalities
usual at town elections, they may be condemned to pay a fine; *y but when the
public officer performs his duty without ability, and when he obeys the letter
of the law without zeal or energy, he is at least beyond the reach of judicial
interference. The Court of Sessions, even when it is invested with its official
powers, is in this case unable to compel him to a more satisfactory obedience.
The fear of removal is the only check to these quasi-offences; and as the Court
of Sessions does not originate the town authorities, it cannot remove
functionaries whom it does not appoint. Moreover, a perpetual investigation
would be necessary to convict the officer of negligence or lukewarmness; and
the Court of Sessions sits but twice a year and then only judges such offences
as are brought before its notice. The only security of that active and
enlightened obedience which a court of justice cannot impose upon public
officers lies in the possibility of their arbitrary removal. In France this
security is sought for in powers exercised by the heads of the administration;
in America it is sought for in the principle of election.
y 
[ Laws of Massachusetts, vol. ii. p. 45.]
Thus, to recapitulate in a few words what I have been showing: If a public
officer in New England commits a crime in the exercise of his functions, the
ordinary courts of justice are always called upon to pass sentence upon him. If
he commits a fault in his official capacity, a purely administrative tribunal
is empowered to punish him; and, if the affair is important or urgent, the
judge supplies the omission of the functionary. *z Lastly, if the same
individual is guilty of one of those intangible offences of which human justice
has no cognizance, he annually appears before a tribunal from which there is no
appeal, which can at once reduce him to insignificance and deprive him of his
charge. This system undoubtedly possesses great advantages, but its execution
is attended with a practical difficulty which it is important to point out.
z 
[ If, for instance, a township persists in refusing to name its assessors, the
Court of Sessions nominates them; and the magistrates thus appointed are
invested with the same authority as elected officers. See the Act quoted above,
February 20, 1787.]
I have already observed that the administrative tribunal, which is called the
Court of Sessions, has no right of inspection over the town officers. It can
only interfere when the conduct of a magistrate is specially brought under its
notice; and this is the delicate part of the system. The Americans of New
England are unacquainted with the office of public prosecutor in the Court of
Sessions, *a and it may readily be perceived that it could not have been
established without difficulty. If an accusing magistrate had merely been
appointed in the chief town of each county, and if he had been unassisted by
agents in the townships, he would not have been better acquainted with what was
going on in the county than the members of the Court of Sessions. But to
appoint agents in each township would have been to centre in his person the
most formidable of powers, that of a judicial administration. Moreover, laws
are the children of habit, and nothing of the kind exists in the legislation of
England. The Americans have therefore divided the offices of inspection and of
prosecution, as well as all the other functions of the administration. Grand
jurors are bound by the law to apprise the court to which they belong of all
the misdemeanors which may have been committed in their county. *b There are
certain great offences which are officially prosecuted by the States; *c but
more frequently the task of punishing delinquents devolves upon the fiscal
officer, whose province it is to receive the fine: thus the treasurer of the
township is charged with the prosecution of such administrative offences as
fall under his notice. But a more special appeal is made by American
legislation to the private interest of the citizen; *d and this great principle
is constantly to be met with in studying the laws of the United States.
American legislators are more apt to give men credit for intelligence than for
honesty, and they rely not a little on personal cupidity for the execution of
the laws. When an individual is really and sensibly injured by an
administrative abuse, it is natural that his personal interest should induce
him to prosecute. But if a legal formality be required, which, however
advantageous to the community, is of small importance to individuals,
plaintiffs may be less easily found; and thus, by a tacit agreement, the laws
may fall into disuse. Reduced by their system to this extremity, the Americans
are obliged to encourage informers by bestowing on them a portion of the
penalty in certain cases, *e and to insure the execution of the laws by the
dangerous expedient of degrading the morals of the people. The only
administrative authority above the county magistrates is, properly speaking,
that of the Government.
a 
[ I say the Court of Sessions, because in common courts there is a magistrate
who exercises some of the functions of a public prosecutor.]
b 
[ The grand-jurors are, for instance, bound to inform the court of the bad
state of the roads.—Laws of Massachusetts, vol. i. p. 308.]
c 
[ If, for instance, the treasurer of the county holds back his
accounts.—Laws of Massachusetts, vol. i. p. 406.] [Footnote d: Thus, if a
private individual breaks down or is wounded in consequence of the badness of a
road, he can sue the township or the county for damages at the
sessions.—Laws of Massachusetts, vol. i. p. 309.]
e 
[ In cases of invasion or insurrection, if the town-officers neglect to furnish
the necessary stores and ammunition for the militia, the township may be
condemned to a fine of from $200 to $500. It may readily be imagined that in
such a case it might happen that no one cared to prosecute; hence the law adds
that all the citizens may indict offences of this kind, and that half of the
fine shall belong to the plaintiff. See Act of March 6, 1810, vol. ii. p. 236.
The same clause is frequently to be met with in the law of Massachusetts. Not
only are private individuals thus incited to prosecute the public officers, but
the public officers are encouraged in the same manner to bring the disobedience
of private individuals to justice. If a citizen refuses to perform the work
which has been assigned to him upon a road, the road surveyor may prosecute
him, and he receives half the penalty for himself. See the Laws above quoted,
vol. i. p. 308.]
General Remarks On The Administration Of The United States Differences of the
States of the Union in their system of administration—Activity and
perfection of the local authorities decrease towards the South—Power of
the magistrate increases; that of the elector diminishes—Administration
passes from the township to the county—States of New York, Ohio,
Pennsylvania—Principles of administration applicable to the whole
Union—Election of public officers, and inalienability of their
functions—Absence of gradation of ranks—Introduction of judicial
resources into the administration.
I have already premised that, after having examined the constitution of the
township and the county of New England in detail, I should take a general view
of the remainder of the Union. Townships and a local activity exist in every
State; but in no part of the confederation is a township to be met with
precisely similar to those of New England. The more we descend towards the
South, the less active does the business of the township or parish become; the
number of magistrates, of functions, and of rights decreases; the population
exercises a less immediate influence on affairs; town meetings are less
frequent, and the subjects of debate less numerous. The power of the elected
magistrate is augmented and that of the elector diminished, whilst the public
spirit of the local communities is less awakened and less influential. *f These
differences may be perceived to a certain extent in the State of New York; they
are very sensible in Pennsylvania; but they become less striking as we advance
to the northwest. The majority of the emigrants who settle in the northwestern
States are natives of New England, and they carry the habits of their mother
country with them into that which they adopt. A township in Ohio is by no means
dissimilar from a township in Massachusetts.
f 
[ For details see the Revised Statutes of the State of New York, part i. chap.
xi. vol. i. pp. 336-364, entitled, “Of the Powers, Duties, and Privileges
of Towns.”
See in the Digest of the Laws of Pennsylvania, the words Assessors, Collector,
Constables, Overseer of the Poor, Supervisors of Highways; and in the Acts of a
general nature of the State of Ohio, the Act of February 25, 1834, relating to
townships, p. 412; besides the peculiar dispositions relating to divers
town-officers, such as Township’s Clerk, Trustees, Overseers of the Poor,
Fence Viewers, Appraisers of Property, Township’s Treasurer, Constables,
Supervisors of Highways.]
We have seen that in Massachusetts the mainspring of public administration lies
in the township. It forms the common centre of the interests and affections of
the citizens. But this ceases to be the case as we descend to States in which
knowledge is less generally diffused, and where the township consequently
offers fewer guarantees of a wise and active administration. As we leave New
England, therefore, we find that the importance of the town is gradually
transferred to the county, which becomes the centre of administration, and the
intermediate power between the Government and the citizen. In Massachusetts the
business of the county is conducted by the Court of Sessions, which is composed
of a quorum named by the Governor and his council; but the county has no
representative assembly, and its expenditure is voted by the national
legislature. In the great State of New York, on the contrary, and in those of
Ohio and Pennsylvania, the inhabitants of each county choose a certain number
of representatives, who constitute the assembly of the county. *g The county
assembly has the right of taxing the inhabitants to a certain extent; and in
this respect it enjoys the privileges of a real legislative body: at the same
time it exercises an executive power in the county, frequently directs the
administration of the townships, and restricts their authority within much
narrower bounds than in Massachusetts.
g 
[ See the Revised Statutes of the State of New York, part i. chap. xi. vol. i.
p. 340. Id. chap. xii. p. 366; also in the Acts of the State of Ohio, an act
relating to county commissioners, February 25, 1824, p. 263. See the Digest of
the Laws of Pennsylvania, at the words County-rates and Levies, p. 170. In the
State of New York each township elects a representative, who has a share in the
administration of the county as well as in that of the township.]
Such are the principal differences which the systems of county and town
administration present in the Federal States. Were it my intention to examine
the provisions of American law minutely, I should have to point out still
further differences in the executive details of the several communities. But
what I have already said may suffice to show the general principles on which
the administration of the United States rests. These principles are differently
applied; their consequences are more or less numerous in various localities;
but they are always substantially the same. The laws differ, and their outward
features change, but their character does not vary. If the township and the
county are not everywhere constituted in the same manner, it is at least true
that in the United States the county and the township are always based upon the
same principle, namely, that everyone is the best judge of what concerns
himself alone, and the most proper person to supply his private wants. The
township and the county are therefore bound to take care of their special
interests: the State governs, but it does not interfere with their
administration. Exceptions to this rule may be met with, but not a contrary
principle.
The first consequence of this doctrine has been to cause all the magistrates to
be chosen either by or at least from amongst the citizens. As the officers are
everywhere elected or appointed for a certain period, it has been impossible to
establish the rules of a dependent series of authorities; there are almost as
many independent functionaries as there are functions, and the executive power
is disseminated in a multitude of hands. Hence arose the indispensable
necessity of introducing the control of the courts of justice over the
administration, and the system of pecuniary penalties, by which the secondary
bodies and their representatives are constrained to obey the laws. This system
obtains from one end of the Union to the other. The power of punishing the
misconduct of public officers, or of performing the part of the executive in
urgent cases, has not, however, been bestowed on the same judges in all the
States. The Anglo-Americans derived the institution of justices of the peace
from a common source; but although it exists in all the States, it is not
always turned to the same use. The justices of the peace everywhere participate
in the administration of the townships and the counties, *h either as public
officers or as the judges of public misdemeanors, but in most of the States the
more important classes of public offences come under the cognizance of the
ordinary tribunals.
h 
[ In some of the Southern States the county courts are charged with all the
details of the administration. See the Statutes of the State of Tennessee,
arts. Judiciary, Taxes, etc.]
The election of public officers, or the inalienability of their functions, the
absence of a gradation of powers, and the introduction of a judicial control
over the secondary branches of the administration, are the universal
characteristics of the American system from Maine to the Floridas. In some
States (and that of New York has advanced most in this direction) traces of a
centralized administration begin to be discernible. In the State of New York
the officers of the central government exercise, in certain cases, a sort of
inspection or control over the secondary bodies. *i
i 
[ For instance, the direction of public instruction centres in the hands of the
Government. The legislature names the members of the University, who are
denominated Regents; the Governor and Lieutentant-Governor of the State are
necessarily of the number.—Revised Statutes, vol. i. p. 455. The Regents
of the University annually visit the colleges and academies, and make their
report to the legislature. Their superintendence is not inefficient, for
several reasons: the colleges in order to become corporations stand in need of
a charter, which is only granted on the recommendation of the Regents; every
year funds are distributed by the State for the encouragement of learning, and
the Regents are the distributors of this money. See chap. xv.
“Instruction,” Revised Statutes, vol. i. p. 455.
The school-commissioners are obliged to send an annual report to the
Superintendent of the Republic.—Id. p. 488.
A similar report is annually made to the same person on the number and
condition of the poor.—Id. p. 631.]
At other times they constitute a court of appeal for the decision of affairs.
*j In the State of New York judicial penalties are less used than in other
parts as a means of administration, and the right of prosecuting the offences
of public officers is vested in fewer hands. *k The same tendency is faintly
observable in some other States; *l but in general the prominent feature of the
administration in the United States is its excessive local independence.
j 
[ If any one conceives himself to be wronged by the school-commissioners (who
are town-officers), he can appeal to the superintendent of the primary schools,
whose decision is final.—Revised Statutes, vol. i. p. 487.
Provisions similar to those above cited are to be met with from time to time in
the laws of the State of New York; but in general these attempts at
centralization are weak and unproductive. The great authorities of the State
have the right of watching and controlling the subordinate agents, without that
of rewarding or punishing them. The same individual is never empowered to give
an order and to punish disobedience; he has therefore the right of commanding,
without the means of exacting compliance. In 1830 the Superintendent of Schools
complained in his Annual Report addressed to the legislature that several
school-commissioners had neglected, notwithstanding his application, to furnish
him with the accounts which were due. He added that if this omission continued
he should be obliged to prosecute them, as the law directs, before the proper
tribunals.]
k 
[ Thus the district-attorney is directed to recover all fines below the sum of
fifty dollars, unless such a right has been specially awarded to another
magistrate.—Revised Statutes, vol. i. p. 383.]
l 
[ Several traces of centralization may be discovered in Massachusetts; for
instance, the committees of the town-schools are directed to make an annual
report to the Secretary of State. See Laws of Massachusetts, vol. i. p. 367.]
Of The State
I have described the townships and the administration; it now remains for me to
speak of the State and the Government. This is ground I may pass over rapidly,
without fear of being misunderstood; for all I have to say is to be found in
written forms of the various constitutions, which are easily to be procured.
These constitutions rest upon a simple and rational theory; their forms have
been adopted by all constitutional nations, and are become familiar to us. In
this place, therefore, it is only necessary for me to give a short analysis; I
shall endeavor afterwards to pass judgment upon what I now describe.
Division of the Legislative Body into two Houses—Senate—House of
Representatives—Different functions of these two Bodies.
The legislative power of the State is vested in two assemblies, the first of
which generally bears the name of the Senate. The Senate is commonly a
legislative body; but it sometimes becomes an executive and judicial one. It
takes a part in the government in several ways, according to the constitution
of the different States; *m but it is in the nomination of public functionaries
that it most commonly assumes an executive power. It partakes of judicial power
in the trial of certain political offences, and sometimes also in the decision
of certain civil cases. *n The number of its members is always small. The other
branch of the legislature, which is usually called the House of
Representatives, has no share whatever in the administration, and only takes a
part in the judicial power inasmuch as it impeaches public functionaries before
the Senate. The members of the two Houses are nearly everywhere subject to the
same conditions of election. They are chosen in the same manner, and by the
same citizens. The only difference which exists between them is, that the term
for which the Senate is chosen is in general longer than that of the House of
Representatives. The latter seldom remain in office longer than a year; the
former usually sit two or three years. By granting to the senators the
privilege of being chosen for several years, and being renewed seriatim, the
law takes care to preserve in the legislative body a nucleus of men already
accustomed to public business, and capable of exercising a salutary influence
upon the junior members.
m 
[ In Massachusetts the Senate is not invested with any administrative
functions.]
n 
[ As in the State of New York.]
The Americans, plainly, did not desire, by this separation of the legislative
body into two branches, to make one house hereditary and the other elective;
one aristocratic and the other democratic. It was not their object to create in
the one a bulwark to power, whilst the other represented the interests and
passions of the people. The only advantages which result from the present
constitution of the United States are the division of the legislative power and
the consequent check upon political assemblies; with the creation of a tribunal
of appeal for the revision of the laws.
Time and experience, however, have convinced the Americans that if these are
its only advantages, the division of the legislative power is still a principle
of the greatest necessity. Pennsylvania was the only one of the United States
which at first attempted to establish a single House of Assembly, and Franklin
himself was so far carried away by the necessary consequences of the principle
of the sovereignty of the people as to have concurred in the measure; but the
Pennsylvanians were soon obliged to change the law, and to create two Houses.
Thus the principle of the division of the legislative power was finally
established, and its necessity may henceforward be regarded as a demonstrated
truth. This theory, which was nearly unknown to the republics of
antiquity—which was introduced into the world almost by accident, like so
many other great truths—and misunderstood by several modern nations, is
at length become an axiom in the political science of the present age.
[See Benjamin Franklin]
The Executive Power Of The State
Office of Governor in an American State—The place he occupies in relation
to the Legislature—His rights and his duties—His dependence on the
people.
The executive power of the State may with truth be said to be represented by
the Governor, although he enjoys but a portion of its rights. The supreme
magistrate, under the title of Governor, is the official moderator and
counsellor of the legislature. He is armed with a veto or suspensive power,
which allows him to stop, or at least to retard, its movements at pleasure. He
lays the wants of the country before the legislative body, and points out the
means which he thinks may be usefully employed in providing for them; he is the
natural executor of its decrees in all the undertakings which interest the
nation at large. *o In the absence of the legislature, the Governor is bound to
take all necessary steps to guard the State against violent shocks and
unforeseen dangers. The whole military power of the State is at the disposal of
the Governor. He is the commander of the militia, and head of the armed force.
When the authority, which is by general consent awarded to the laws, is
disregarded, the Governor puts himself at the head of the armed force of the
State, to quell resistance, and to restore order. Lastly, the Governor takes no
share in the administration of townships and counties, except it be indirectly
in the nomination of Justices of the Peace, which nomination he has not the
power to cancel. *p The Governor is an elected magistrate, and is generally
chosen for one or two years only; so that he always continues to be strictly
dependent upon the majority who returned him.
o 
[ Practically speaking, it is not always the Governor who executes the plans of
the Legislature; it often happens that the latter, in voting a measure, names
special agents to superintend the execution of it.]
p 
[ In some of the States the justices of the peace are not elected by the
Governor.]
Political Effects Of The System Of Local Administration In The United States
Necessary distinction between the general centralization of Government and the
centralization of the local administration—Local administration not
centralized in the United States: great general centralization of the
Government—Some bad consequences resulting to the United States from the
local administration—Administrative advantages attending this order of
things—The power which conducts the Government is less regular, less
enlightened, less learned, but much greater than in Europe—Political
advantages of this order of things—In the United States the interests of
the country are everywhere kept in view—Support given to the Government
by the community—Provincial institutions more necessary in proportion as
the social condition becomes more democratic—Reason of this.
Centralization is become a word of general and daily use, without any precise
meaning being attached to it. Nevertheless, there exist two distinct kinds of
centralization, which it is necessary to discriminate with accuracy. Certain
interests are common to all parts of a nation, such as the enactment of its
general laws and the maintenance of its foreign relations. Other interests are
peculiar to certain parts of the nation; such, for instance, as the business of
different townships. When the power which directs the general interests is
centred in one place, or vested in the same persons, it constitutes a central
government. In like manner the power of directing partial or local interests,
when brought together into one place, constitutes what may be termed a central
administration.
Upon some points these two kinds of centralization coalesce; but by classifying
the objects which fall more particularly within the province of each of them,
they may easily be distinguished. It is evident that a central government
acquires immense power when united to administrative centralization. Thus
combined, it accustoms men to set their own will habitually and completely
aside; to submit, not only for once, or upon one point, but in every respect,
and at all times. Not only, therefore, does this union of power subdue them
compulsorily, but it affects them in the ordinary habits of life, and
influences each individual, first separately and then collectively.
These two kinds of centralization mutually assist and attract each other; but
they must not be supposed to be inseparable. It is impossible to imagine a more
completely central government than that which existed in France under Louis
XIV.; when the same individual was the author and the interpreter of the laws,
and the representative of France at home and abroad, he was justified in
asserting that the State was identified with his person. Nevertheless, the
administration was much less centralized under Louis XIV. than it is at the
present day.
In England the centralization of the government is carried to great perfection;
the State has the compact vigor of a man, and by the sole act of its will it
puts immense engines in motion, and wields or collects the efforts of its
authority. Indeed, I cannot conceive that a nation can enjoy a secure or
prosperous existence without a powerful centralization of government. But I am
of opinion that a central administration enervates the nations in which it
exists by incessantly diminishing their public spirit. If such an
administration succeeds in condensing at a given moment, on a given point, all
the disposable resources of a people, it impairs at least the renewal of those
resources. It may ensure a victory in the hour of strife, but it gradually
relaxes the sinews of strength. It may contribute admirably to the transient
greatness of a man, but it cannot ensure the durable prosperity of a nation.
If we pay proper attention, we shall find that whenever it is said that a State
cannot act because it has no central point, it is the centralization of the
government in which it is deficient. It is frequently asserted, and we are
prepared to assent to the proposition, that the German empire was never able to
bring all its powers into action. But the reason was, that the State was never
able to enforce obedience to its general laws, because the several members of
that great body always claimed the right, or found the means, of refusing their
co-operation to the representatives of the common authority, even in the
affairs which concerned the mass of the people; in other words, because there
was no centralization of government. The same remark is applicable to the
Middle Ages; the cause of all the confusion of feudal society was that the
control, not only of local but of general interests, was divided amongst a
thousand hands, and broken up in a thousand different ways; the absence of a
central government prevented the nations of Europe from advancing with energy
in any straightforward course.
We have shown that in the United States no central administration and no
dependent series of public functionaries exist. Local authority has been
carried to lengths which no European nation could endure without great
inconvenience, and which has even produced some disadvantageous consequences in
America. But in the United States the centralization of the Government is
complete; and it would be easy to prove that the national power is more compact
than it has ever been in the old nations of Europe. Not only is there but one
legislative body in each State; not only does there exist but one source of
political authority; but district assemblies and county courts have not in
general been multiplied, lest they should be tempted to exceed their
administrative duties, and interfere with the Government. In America the
legislature of each State is supreme; nothing can impede its authority; neither
privileges, nor local immunities, nor personal influence, nor even the empire
of reason, since it represents that majority which claims to be the sole organ
of reason. Its own determination is, therefore, the only limit to this action.
In juxtaposition to it, and under its immediate control, is the representative
of the executive power, whose duty it is to constrain the refractory to submit
by superior force. The only symptom of weakness lies in certain details of the
action of the Government. The American republics have no standing armies to
intimidate a discontented minority; but as no minority has as yet been reduced
to declare open war, the necessity of an army has not been felt. *q The State
usually employs the officers of the township or the county to deal with the
citizens. Thus, for instance, in New England, the assessor fixes the rate of
taxes; the collector receives them; the town-treasurer transmits the amount to
the public treasury; and the disputes which may arise are brought before the
ordinary courts of justice. This method of collecting taxes is slow as well as
inconvenient, and it would prove a perpetual hindrance to a Government whose
pecuniary demands were large. It is desirable that, in whatever materially
affects its existence, the Government should be served by officers of its own,
appointed by itself, removable at pleasure, and accustomed to rapid methods of
proceeding. But it will always be easy for the central government, organized as
it is in America, to introduce new and more efficacious modes of action,
proportioned to its wants. [Footnote q: [The Civil War of 1860-65 cruelly
belied this statement, and in the course of the struggle the North alone called
two millions and a half of men to arms; but to the honor of the United States
it must be added that, with the cessation of the contest, this army disappeared
as rapidly as it had been raised.—Translator’s Note.]]
The absence of a central government will not, then, as has often been asserted,
prove the destruction of the republics of the New World; far from supposing
that the American governments are not sufficiently centralized, I shall prove
hereafter that they are too much so. The legislative bodies daily encroach upon
the authority of the Government, and their tendency, like that of the French
Convention, is to appropriate it entirely to themselves. Under these
circumstances the social power is constantly changing hands, because it is
subordinate to the power of the people, which is too apt to forget the maxims
of wisdom and of foresight in the consciousness of its strength: hence arises
its danger; and thus its vigor, and not its impotence, will probably be the
cause of its ultimate destruction.
The system of local administration produces several different effects in
America. The Americans seem to me to have outstepped the limits of sound policy
in isolating the administration of the Government; for order, even in
second-rate affairs, is a matter of national importance. *r As the State has no
administrative functionaries of its own, stationed on different points of its
territory, to whom it can give a common impulse, the consequence is that it
rarely attempts to issue any general police regulations. The want of these
regulations is severely felt, and is frequently observed by Europeans. The
appearance of disorder which prevails on the surface leads him at first to
imagine that society is in a state of anarchy; nor does he perceive his mistake
till he has gone deeper into the subject. Certain undertakings are of
importance to the whole State; but they cannot be put in execution, because
there is no national administration to direct them. Abandoned to the exertions
of the towns or counties, under the care of elected or temporary agents, they
lead to no result, or at least to no durable benefit.
r 
[ The authority which represents the State ought not, I think, to waive the
right of inspecting the local administration, even when it does not interfere
more actively. Suppose, for instance, that an agent of the Government was
stationed at some appointed spot in the country, to prosecute the misdemeanors
of the town and county officers, would not a more uniform order be the result,
without in any way compromising the independence of the township? Nothing of
the kind, however, exists in America: there is nothing above the county-courts,
which have, as it were, only an incidental cognizance of the offences they are
meant to repress.]
The partisans of centralization in Europe are wont to maintain that the
Government directs the affairs of each locality better than the citizens could
do it for themselves; this may be true when the central power is enlightened,
and when the local districts are ignorant; when it is as alert as they are
slow; when it is accustomed to act, and they to obey. Indeed, it is evident
that this double tendency must augment with the increase of centralization, and
that the readiness of the one and the incapacity of the others must become more
and more prominent. But I deny that such is the case when the people is as
enlightened, as awake to its interests, and as accustomed to reflect on them,
as the Americans are. I am persuaded, on the contrary, that in this case the
collective strength of the citizens will always conduce more efficaciously to
the public welfare than the authority of the Government. It is difficult to
point out with certainty the means of arousing a sleeping population, and of
giving it passions and knowledge which it does not possess; it is, I am well
aware, an arduous task to persuade men to busy themselves about their own
affairs; and it would frequently be easier to interest them in the punctilios
of court etiquette than in the repairs of their common dwelling. But whenever a
central administration affects to supersede the persons most interested, I am
inclined to suppose that it is either misled or desirous to mislead. However
enlightened and however skilful a central power may be, it cannot of itself
embrace all the details of the existence of a great nation. Such vigilance
exceeds the powers of man. And when it attempts to create and set in motion so
many complicated springs, it must submit to a very imperfect result, or consume
itself in bootless efforts.
Centralization succeeds more easily, indeed, in subjecting the external actions
of men to a certain uniformity, which at least commands our regard,
independently of the objects to which it is applied, like those devotees who
worship the statue and forget the deity it represents. Centralization imparts
without difficulty an admirable regularity to the routine of business; provides
for the details of the social police with sagacity; represses the smallest
disorder and the most petty misdemeanors; maintains society in a status quo
alike secure from improvement and decline; and perpetuates a drowsy precision
in the conduct of affairs, which is hailed by the heads of the administration
as a sign of perfect order and public tranquillity: *s in short, it excels more
in prevention than in action. Its force deserts it when society is to be
disturbed or accelerated in its course; and if once the co-operation of private
citizens is necessary to the furtherance of its measures, the secret of its
impotence is disclosed. Even whilst it invokes their assistance, it is on the
condition that they shall act exactly as much as the Government chooses, and
exactly in the manner it appoints. They are to take charge of the details,
without aspiring to guide the system; they are to work in a dark and
subordinate sphere, and only to judge the acts in which they have themselves
cooperated by their results. These, however, are not conditions on which the
alliance of the human will is to be obtained; its carriage must be free and its
actions responsible, or (such is the constitution of man) the citizen had
rather remain a passive spectator than a dependent actor in schemes with which
he is unacquainted.

[ China appears to me to present the most perfect instance of that species of
well-being which a completely central administration may furnish to the nations
among which it exists. Travellers assure us that the Chinese have peace without
happiness, industry without improvement, stability without strength, and public
order without public morality. The condition of society is always tolerable,
never excellent. I am convinced that, when China is opened to European
observation, it will be found to contain the most perfect model of a central
administration which exists in the universe.]
It is undeniable that the want of those uniform regulations which control the
conduct of every inhabitant of France is not unfrequently felt in the United
States. Gross instances of social indifference and neglect are to be met with,
and from time to time disgraceful blemishes are seen in complete contrast with
the surrounding civilization. Useful undertakings which cannot succeed without
perpetual attention and rigorous exactitude are very frequently abandoned in
the end; for in America, as well as in other countries, the people is subject
to sudden impulses and momentary exertions. The European who is accustomed to
find a functionary always at hand to interfere with all he undertakes has some
difficulty in accustoming himself to the complex mechanism of the
administration of the townships. In general it may be affirmed that the lesser
details of the police, which render life easy and comfortable, are neglected in
America; but that the essential guarantees of man in society are as strong
there as elsewhere. In America the power which conducts the Government is far
less regular, less enlightened, and less learned, but an hundredfold more
authoritative than in Europe. In no country in the world do the citizens make
such exertions for the common weal; and I am acquainted with no people which
has established schools as numerous and as efficacious, places of public
worship better suited to the wants of the inhabitants, or roads kept in better
repair. Uniformity or permanence of design, the minute arrangement of details,
*t and the perfection of an ingenious administration, must not be sought for in
the United States; but it will be easy to find, on the other hand, the symptoms
of a power which, if it is somewhat barbarous, is at least robust; and of an
existence which is checkered with accidents indeed, but cheered at the same
time by animation and effort.

[ A writer of talent, who, in the comparison which he has drawn between the
finances of France and those of the United States, has proved that ingenuity
cannot always supply the place of a knowledge of facts, very justly reproaches
the Americans for the sort of confusion which exists in the accounts of the
expenditure in the townships; and after giving the model of a departmental
budget in France, he adds:—“We are indebted to centralization, that
admirable invention of a great man, for the uniform order and method which
prevail alike in all the municipal budgets, from the largest town to the
humblest commune.” Whatever may be my admiration of this result, when I
see the communes of France, with their excellent system of accounts, plunged
into the grossest ignorance of their true interests, and abandoned to so
incorrigible an apathy that they seem to vegetate rather than to live; when, on
the other hand, I observe the activity, the information, and the spirit of
enterprise which keep society in perpetual labor, in those American townships
whose budgets are drawn up with small method and with still less uniformity, I
am struck by the spectacle; for to my mind the end of a good government is to
ensure the welfare of a people, and not to establish order and regularity in
the midst of its misery and its distress. I am therefore led to suppose that
the prosperity of the American townships and the apparent confusion of their
accounts, the distress of the French communes and the perfection of their
budget, may be attributable to the same cause. At any rate I am suspicious of a
benefit which is united to so many evils, and I am not averse to an evil which
is compensated by so many benefits.]
Granting for an instant that the villages and counties of the United States
would be more usefully governed by a remote authority which they had never seen
than by functionaries taken from the midst of them—admitting, for the
sake of argument, that the country would be more secure, and the resources of
society better employed, if the whole administration centred in a single
arm—still the political advantages which the Americans derive from their
system would induce me to prefer it to the contrary plan. It profits me but
little, after all, that a vigilant authority should protect the tranquillity of
my pleasures and constantly avert all dangers from my path, without my care or
my concern, if this same authority is the absolute mistress of my liberty and
of my life, and if it so monopolizes all the energy of existence that when it
languishes everything languishes around it, that when it sleeps everything must
sleep, that when it dies the State itself must perish.
In certain countries of Europe the natives consider themselves as a kind of
settlers, indifferent to the fate of the spot upon which they live. The
greatest changes are effected without their concurrence and (unless chance may
have apprised them of the event) without their knowledge; nay more, the citizen
is unconcerned as to the condition of his village, the police of his street,
the repairs of the church or of the parsonage; for he looks upon all these
things as unconnected with himself, and as the property of a powerful stranger
whom he calls the Government. He has only a life-interest in these possessions,
and he entertains no notions of ownership or of improvement. This want of
interest in his own affairs goes so far that, if his own safety or that of his
children is endangered, instead of trying to avert the peril, he will fold his
arms, and wait till the nation comes to his assistance. This same individual,
who has so completely sacrificed his own free will, has no natural propensity
to obedience; he cowers, it is true, before the pettiest officer; but he braves
the law with the spirit of a conquered foe as soon as its superior force is
removed: his oscillations between servitude and license are perpetual. When a
nation has arrived at this state it must either change its customs and its laws
or perish: the source of public virtue is dry, and, though it may contain
subjects, the race of citizens is extinct. Such communities are a natural prey
to foreign conquests, and if they do not disappear from the scene of life, it
is because they are surrounded by other nations similar or inferior to
themselves: it is because the instinctive feeling of their country’s
claims still exists in their hearts; and because an involuntary pride in the
name it bears, or a vague reminiscence of its bygone fame, suffices to give
them the impulse of self-preservation.
Nor can the prodigious exertions made by tribes in the defence of a country to
which they did not belong be adduced in favor of such a system; for it will be
found that in these cases their main incitement was religion. The permanence,
the glory, or the prosperity of the nation were become parts of their faith,
and in defending the country they inhabited they defended that Holy City of
which they were all citizens. The Turkish tribes have never taken an active
share in the conduct of the affairs of society, but they accomplished
stupendous enterprises as long as the victories of the Sultan were the triumphs
of the Mohammedan faith. In the present age they are in rapid decay, because
their religion is departing, and despotism only remains. Montesquieu, who
attributed to absolute power an authority peculiar to itself, did it, as I
conceive, an undeserved honor; for despotism, taken by itself, can produce no
durable results. On close inspection we shall find that religion, and not fear,
has ever been the cause of the long-lived prosperity of an absolute government.
Whatever exertions may be made, no true power can be founded among men which
does not depend upon the free union of their inclinations; and patriotism and
religion are the only two motives in the world which can permanently direct the
whole of a body politic to one end.
Laws cannot succeed in rekindling the ardor of an extinguished faith, but men
may be interested in the fate of their country by the laws. By this influence
the vague impulse of patriotism, which never abandons the human heart, may be
directed and revived; and if it be connected with the thoughts, the passions,
and the daily habits of life, it may be consolidated into a durable and
rational sentiment.
Let it not be said that the time for the experiment is already past; for the
old age of nations is not like the old age of men, and every fresh generation
is a new people ready for the care of the legislator.
It is not the administrative but the political effects of the local system that
I most admire in America. In the United States the interests of the country are
everywhere kept in view; they are an object of solicitude to the people of the
whole Union, and every citizen is as warmly attached to them as if they were
his own. He takes pride in the glory of his nation; he boasts of its success,
to which he conceives himself to have contributed, and he rejoices in the
general prosperity by which he profits. The feeling he entertains towards the
State is analogous to that which unites him to his family, and it is by a kind
of egotism that he interests himself in the welfare of his country.
The European generally submits to a public officer because he represents a
superior force; but to an American he represents a right. In America it may be
said that no one renders obedience to man, but to justice and to law. If the
opinion which the citizen entertains of himself is exaggerated, it is at least
salutary; he unhesitatingly confides in his own powers, which appear to him to
be all-sufficient. When a private individual meditates an undertaking, however
directly connected it may be with the welfare of society, he never thinks of
soliciting the co-operation of the Government, but he publishes his plan,
offers to execute it himself, courts the assistance of other individuals, and
struggles manfully against all obstacles. Undoubtedly he is often less
successful than the State might have been in his position; but in the end the
sum of these private undertakings far exceeds all that the Government could
have done.
As the administrative authority is within the reach of the citizens, whom it in
some degree represents, it excites neither their jealousy nor their hatred; as
its resources are limited, every one feels that he must not rely solely on its
assistance. Thus, when the administration thinks fit to interfere, it is not
abandoned to itself as in Europe; the duties of the private citizens are not
supposed to have lapsed because the State assists in their fulfilment, but
every one is ready, on the contrary, to guide and to support it. This action of
individual exertions, joined to that of the public authorities, frequently
performs what the most energetic central administration would be unable to
execute. It would be easy to adduce several facts in proof of what I advance,
but I had rather give only one, with which I am more thoroughly acquainted. *u
In America the means which the authorities have at their disposal for the
discovery of crimes and the arrest of criminals are few. The State police does
not exist, and passports are unknown. The criminal police of the United States
cannot be compared to that of France; the magistrates and public prosecutors
are not numerous, and the examinations of prisoners are rapid and oral.
Nevertheless in no country does crime more rarely elude punishment. The reason
is, that every one conceives himself to be interested in furnishing evidence of
the act committed, and in stopping the delinquent. During my stay in the United
States I witnessed the spontaneous formation of committees for the pursuit and
prosecution of a man who had committed a great crime in a certain county. In
Europe a criminal is an unhappy being who is struggling for his life against
the ministers of justice, whilst the population is merely a spectator of the
conflict; in America he is looked upon as an enemy of the human race, and the
whole of mankind is against him.

[ See Appendix, I.]
I believe that provincial institutions are useful to all nations, but nowhere
do they appear to me to be more indispensable than amongst a democratic people.
In an aristocracy order can always be maintained in the midst of liberty, and
as the rulers have a great deal to lose order is to them a first-rate
consideration. In like manner an aristocracy protects the people from the
excesses of despotism, because it always possesses an organized power ready to
resist a despot. But a democracy without provincial institutions has no
security against these evils. How can a populace, unaccustomed to freedom in
small concerns, learn to use it temperately in great affairs? What resistance
can be offered to tyranny in a country where every private individual is
impotent, and where the citizens are united by no common tie? Those who dread
the license of the mob, and those who fear the rule of absolute power, ought
alike to desire the progressive growth of provincial liberties.
On the other hand, I am convinced that democratic nations are most exposed to
fall beneath the yoke of a central administration, for several reasons, amongst
which is the following. The constant tendency of these nations is to
concentrate all the strength of the Government in the hands of the only power
which directly represents the people, because beyond the people nothing is to
be perceived but a mass of equal individuals confounded together. But when the
same power is already in possession of all the attributes of the Government, it
can scarcely refrain from penetrating into the details of the administration,
and an opportunity of doing so is sure to present itself in the end, as was the
case in France. In the French Revolution there were two impulses in opposite
directions, which must never be confounded—the one was favorable to
liberty, the other to despotism. Under the ancient monarchy the King was the
sole author of the laws, and below the power of the sovereign certain vestiges
of provincial institutions, half destroyed, were still distinguishable. These
provincial institutions were incoherent, ill compacted, and frequently absurd;
in the hands of the aristocracy they had sometimes been converted into
instruments of oppression. The Revolution declared itself the enemy of royalty
and of provincial institutions at the same time; it confounded all that had
preceded it—despotic power and the checks to its abuses—in
indiscriminate hatred, and its tendency was at once to overthrow and to
centralize. This double character of the French Revolution is a fact which has
been adroitly handled by the friends of absolute power. Can they be accused of
laboring in the cause of despotism when they are defending that central
administration which was one of the great innovations of the Revolution? *v In
this manner popularity may be conciliated with hostility to the rights of the
people, and the secret slave of tyranny may be the professed admirer of
freedom.

[ See Appendix K.]
I have visited the two nations in which the system of provincial liberty has
been most perfectly established, and I have listened to the opinions of
different parties in those countries. In America I met with men who secretly
aspired to destroy the democratic institutions of the Union; in England I found
others who attacked the aristocracy openly, but I know of no one who does not
regard provincial independence as a great benefit. In both countries I have
heard a thousand different causes assigned for the evils of the State, but the
local system was never mentioned amongst them. I have heard citizens attribute
the power and prosperity of their country to a multitude of reasons, but they
all placed the advantages of local institutions in the foremost rank. Am I to
suppose that when men who are naturally so divided on religious opinions and on
political theories agree on one point (and that one of which they have daily
experience), they are all in error? The only nations which deny the utility of
provincial liberties are those which have fewest of them; in other words, those
who are unacquainted with the institution are the only persons who pass a
censure upon it.

Judicial Power In The United States And Its Influence On Political Society.
I have thought it essential to devote a separate chapter to the judicial
authorities of the United States, lest their great political importance should
be lessened in the reader’s eyes by a merely incidental mention of them.
Confederations have existed in other countries beside America, and republics
have not been established upon the shores of the New World alone; the
representative system of government has been adopted in several States of
Europe, but I am not aware that any nation of the globe has hitherto organized
a judicial power on the principle now adopted by the Americans. The judicial
organization of the United States is the institution which a stranger has the
greatest difficulty in understanding. He hears the authority of a judge invoked
in the political occurrences of every day, and he naturally concludes that in
the United States the judges are important political functionaries;
nevertheless, when he examines the nature of the tribunals, they offer nothing
which is contrary to the usual habits and privileges of those bodies, and the
magistrates seem to him to interfere in public affairs of chance, but by a
chance which recurs every day.
When the Parliament of Paris remonstrated, or refused to enregister an edict,
or when it summoned a functionary accused of malversation to its bar, its
political influence as a judicial body was clearly visible; but nothing of the
kind is to be seen in the United States. The Americans have retained all the
ordinary characteristics of judicial authority, and have carefully restricted
its action to the ordinary circle of its functions.
The first characteristic of judicial power in all nations is the duty of
arbitration. But rights must be contested in order to warrant the interference
of a tribunal; and an action must be brought to obtain the decision of a judge.
As long, therefore, as the law is uncontested, the judicial authority is not
called upon to discuss it, and it may exist without being perceived. When a
judge in a given case attacks a law relating to that case, he extends the
circle of his customary duties, without however stepping beyond it; since he is
in some measure obliged to decide upon the law in order to decide the case. But
if he pronounces upon a law without resting upon a case, he clearly steps
beyond his sphere, and invades that of the legislative authority.
The second characteristic of judicial power is that it pronounces on special
cases, and not upon general principles. If a judge in deciding a particular
point destroys a general principle, by passing a judgment which tends to reject
all the inferences from that principle, and consequently to annul it, he
remains within the ordinary limits of his functions. But if he directly attacks
a general principle without having a particular case in view, he leaves the
circle in which all nations have agreed to confine his authority, he assumes a
more important, and perhaps a more useful, influence than that of the
magistrate, but he ceases to be a representative of the judicial power.
The third characteristic of the judicial power is its inability to act unless
it is appealed to, or until it has taken cognizance of an affair. This
characteristic is less general than the other two; but, notwithstanding the
exceptions, I think it may be regarded as essential. The judicial power is by
its nature devoid of action; it must be put in motion in order to produce a
result. When it is called upon to repress a crime, it punishes the criminal;
when a wrong is to be redressed, it is ready to redress it; when an act
requires interpretation, it is prepared to interpret it; but it does not pursue
criminals, hunt out wrongs, or examine into evidence of its own accord. A
judicial functionary who should open proceedings, and usurp the censorship of
the laws, would in some measure do violence to the passive nature of his
authority.
The Americans have retained these three distinguishing characteristics of the
judicial power; an American judge can only pronounce a decision when litigation
has arisen, he is only conversant with special cases, and he cannot act until
the cause has been duly brought before the court. His position is therefore
perfectly similar to that of the magistrate of other nations; and he is
nevertheless invested with immense political power. If the sphere of his
authority and his means of action are the same as those of other judges, it may
be asked whence he derives a power which they do not possess. The cause of this
difference lies in the simple fact that the Americans have acknowledged the
right of the judges to found their decisions on the constitution rather than on
the laws. In other words, they have left them at liberty not to apply such laws
as may appear to them to be unconstitutional.
I am aware that a similar right has been claimed—but claimed in
vain—by courts of justice in other countries; but in America it is
recognized by all authorities; and not a party, nor so much as an individual,
is found to contest it. This fact can only be explained by the principles of
the American constitution. In France the constitution is (or at least is
supposed to be) immutable; and the received theory is that no power has the
right of changing any part of it. In England the Parliament has an acknowledged
right to modify the constitution; as, therefore, the constitution may undergo
perpetual changes, it does not in reality exist; the Parliament is at once a
legislative and a constituent assembly. The political theories of America are
more simple and more rational. An American constitution is not supposed to be
immutable as in France, nor is it susceptible of modification by the ordinary
powers of society as in England. It constitutes a detached whole, which, as it
represents the determination of the whole people, is no less binding on the
legislator than on the private citizen, but which may be altered by the will of
the people in predetermined cases, according to established rules. In America
the constitution may therefore vary, but as long as it exists it is the origin
of all authority, and the sole vehicle of the predominating force. *a

[ [The fifth article of the original Constitution of the United States provides
the mode in which amendments of the Constitution may be made. Amendments must
be proposed by two-thirds of both Houses of Congress, and ratified by the
Legislatures of three-fourths of the several States. Fifteen amendments of the
Constitution have been made at different times since 1789, the most important
of which are the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth, framed and ratified
after the Civil War. The original Constitution of the United States, followed
by these fifteen amendments, is printed at the end of this edition.
—Translator’s Note, 1874.]]
It is easy to perceive in what manner these differences must act upon the
position and the rights of the judicial bodies in the three countries I have
cited. If in France the tribunals were authorized to disobey the laws on the
ground of their being opposed to the constitution, the supreme power would in
fact be placed in their hands, since they alone would have the right of
interpreting a constitution, the clauses of which can be modified by no
authority. They would therefore take the place of the nation, and exercise as
absolute a sway over society as the inherent weakness of judicial power would
allow them to do. Undoubtedly, as the French judges are incompetent to declare
a law to be unconstitutional, the power of changing the constitution is
indirectly given to the legislative body, since no legal barrier would oppose
the alterations which it might prescribe. But it is better to grant the power
of changing the constitution of the people to men who represent (however
imperfectly) the will of the people, than to men who represent no one but
themselves.
It would be still more unreasonable to invest the English judges with the right
of resisting the decisions of the legislative body, since the Parliament which
makes the laws also makes the constitution; and consequently a law emanating
from the three powers of the State can in no case be unconstitutional. But
neither of these remarks is applicable to America.
In the United States the constitution governs the legislator as much as the
private citizen; as it is the first of laws it cannot be modified by a law, and
it is therefore just that the tribunals should obey the constitution in
preference to any law. This condition is essential to the power of the
judicature, for to select that legal obligation by which he is most strictly
bound is the natural right of every magistrate.
In France the constitution is also the first of laws, and the judges have the
same right to take it as the ground of their decisions, but were they to
exercise this right they must perforce encroach on rights more sacred than
their own, namely, on those of society, in whose name they are acting. In this
case the State-motive clearly prevails over the motives of an individual. In
America, where the nation can always reduce its magistrates to obedience by
changing its constitution, no danger of this kind is to be feared. Upon this
point, therefore, the political and the logical reasons agree, and the people
as well as the judges preserve their privileges.
Whenever a law which the judge holds to be unconstitutional is argued in a
tribunal of the United States he may refuse to admit it as a rule; this power
is the only one which is peculiar to the American magistrate, but it gives rise
to immense political influence. Few laws can escape the searching analysis of
the judicial power for any length of time, for there are few which are not
prejudicial to some private interest or other, and none which may not be
brought before a court of justice by the choice of parties, or by the necessity
of the case. But from the time that a judge has refused to apply any given law
in a case, that law loses a portion of its moral cogency. The persons to whose
interests it is prejudicial learn that means exist of evading its authority,
and similar suits are multiplied, until it becomes powerless. One of two
alternatives must then be resorted to: the people must alter the constitution,
or the legislature must repeal the law. The political power which the Americans
have intrusted to their courts of justice is therefore immense, but the evils
of this power are considerably diminished by the obligation which has been
imposed of attacking the laws through the courts of justice alone. If the judge
had been empowered to contest the laws on the ground of theoretical
generalities, if he had been enabled to open an attack or to pass a censure on
the legislator, he would have played a prominent part in the political sphere;
and as the champion or the antagonist of a party, he would have arrayed the
hostile passions of the nation in the conflict. But when a judge contests a law
applied to some particular case in an obscure proceeding, the importance of his
attack is concealed from the public gaze, his decision bears upon the interest
of an individual, and if the law is slighted it is only collaterally. Moreover,
although it is censured, it is not abolished; its moral force may be
diminished, but its cogency is by no means suspended, and its final destruction
can only be accomplished by the reiterated attacks of judicial functionaries.
It will readily be understood that by connecting the censorship of the laws
with the private interests of members of the community, and by intimately
uniting the prosecution of the law with the prosecution of an individual,
legislation is protected from wanton assailants, and from the daily aggressions
of party spirit. The errors of the legislator are exposed whenever their evil
consequences are most felt, and it is always a positive and appreciable fact
which serves as the basis of a prosecution.
I am inclined to believe this practice of the American courts to be at once the
most favorable to liberty as well as to public order. If the judge could only
attack the legislator openly and directly, he would sometimes be afraid to
oppose any resistance to his will; and at other moments party spirit might
encourage him to brave it at every turn. The laws would consequently be
attacked when the power from which they emanate is weak, and obeyed when it is
strong. That is to say, when it would be useful to respect them they would be
contested, and when it would be easy to convert them into an instrument of
oppression they would be respected. But the American judge is brought into the
political arena independently of his own will. He only judges the law because
he is obliged to judge a case. The political question which he is called upon
to resolve is connected with the interest of the suitors, and he cannot refuse
to decide it without abdicating the duties of his post. He performs his
functions as a citizen by fulfilling the precise duties which belong to his
profession as a magistrate. It is true that upon this system the judicial
censorship which is exercised by the courts of justice over the legislation
cannot extend to all laws indiscriminately, inasmuch as some of them can never
give rise to that exact species of contestation which is termed a lawsuit; and
even when such a contestation is possible, it may happen that no one cares to
bring it before a court of justice. The Americans have often felt this
disadvantage, but they have left the remedy incomplete, lest they should give
it an efficacy which might in some cases prove dangerous. Within these limits
the power vested in the American courts of justice of pronouncing a statute to
be unconstitutional forms one of the most powerful barriers which has ever been
devised against the tyranny of political assemblies.
Other Powers Granted To American Judges
The United States all the citizens have the right of indicting public
functionaries before the ordinary tribunals—How they use this
right—Art. 75 of the French Constitution of the An VIII—The
Americans and the English cannot understand the purport of this clause.
It is perfectly natural that in a free country like America all the citizens
should have the right of indicting public functionaries before the ordinary
tribunals, and that all the judges should have the power of punishing public
offences. The right granted to the courts of justice of judging the agents of
the executive government, when they have violated the laws, is so natural a one
that it cannot be looked upon as an extraordinary privilege. Nor do the springs
of government appear to me to be weakened in the United States by the custom
which renders all public officers responsible to the judges of the land. The
Americans seem, on the contrary, to have increased by this means that respect
which is due to the authorities, and at the same time to have rendered those
who are in power more scrupulous of offending public opinion. I was struck by
the small number of political trials which occur in the United States, but I
had no difficulty in accounting for this circumstance. A lawsuit, of whatever
nature it may be, is always a difficult and expensive undertaking. It is easy
to attack a public man in a journal, but the motives which can warrant an
action at law must be serious. A solid ground of complaint must therefore exist
to induce an individual to prosecute a public officer, and public officers are
careful not to furnish these grounds of complaint when they are afraid of being
prosecuted.
This does not depend upon the republican form of American institutions, for the
same facts present themselves in England. These two nations do not regard the
impeachment of the principal officers of State as a sufficient guarantee of
their independence. But they hold that the right of minor prosecutions, which
are within the reach of the whole community, is a better pledge of freedom than
those great judicial actions which are rarely employed until it is too late.
In the Middle Ages, when it was very difficult to overtake offenders, the
judges inflicted the most dreadful tortures on the few who were arrested, which
by no means diminished the number of crimes. It has since been discovered that
when justice is more certain and more mild, it is at the same time more
efficacious. The English and the Americans hold that tyranny and oppression are
to be treated like any other crime, by lessening the penalty and facilitating
conviction.
In the year VIII of the French Republic a constitution was drawn up in which
the following clause was introduced: “Art. 75. All the agents of the
government below the rank of ministers can only be prosecuted for offences
relating to their several functions by virtue of a decree of the Conseil
d’Etat; in which the case the prosecution takes place before the ordinary
tribunals.” This clause survived the “Constitution de l’An
VIII,” and it is still maintained in spite of the just complaints of the
nation. I have always found the utmost difficulty in explaining its meaning to
Englishmen or Americans. They were at once led to conclude that the Conseil
d’Etat in France was a great tribunal, established in the centre of the
kingdom, which exercised a preliminary and somewhat tyrannical jurisdiction in
all political causes. But when I told them that the Conseil d’Etat was
not a judicial body, in the common sense of the term, but an administrative
council composed of men dependent on the Crown, so that the king, after having
ordered one of his servants, called a Prefect, to commit an injustice, has the
power of commanding another of his servants, called a Councillor of State, to
prevent the former from being punished; when I demonstrated to them that the
citizen who has been injured by the order of the sovereign is obliged to
solicit from the sovereign permission to obtain redress, they refused to credit
so flagrant an abuse, and were tempted to accuse me of falsehood or of
ignorance. It frequently happened before the Revolution that a Parliament
issued a warrant against a public officer who had committed an offence, and
sometimes the proceedings were stopped by the authority of the Crown, which
enforced compliance with its absolute and despotic will. It is painful to
perceive how much lower we are sunk than our forefathers, since we allow things
to pass under the color of justice and the sanction of the law which violence
alone could impose upon them.
Definition of political jurisdiction—What is understood by political
jurisdiction in France, in England, and in the United States—In America
the political judge can only pass sentence on public officers—He more
frequently passes a sentence of removal from office than a
penalty—Political jurisdiction as it exists in the United States is,
notwithstanding its mildness, and perhaps in consequence of that mildness, a
most powerful instrument in the hands of the majority.
Political Jurisdiction In The United States
I understand, by political jurisdiction, that temporary right of pronouncing a
legal decision with which a political body may be invested.
In absolute governments no utility can accrue from the introduction of
extraordinary forms of procedure; the prince in whose name an offender is
prosecuted is as much the sovereign of the courts of justice as of everything
else, and the idea which is entertained of his power is of itself a sufficient
security. The only thing he has to fear is, that the external formalities of
justice should be neglected, and that his authority should be dishonored from a
wish to render it more absolute. But in most free countries, in which the
majority can never exercise the same influence upon the tribunals as an
absolute monarch, the judicial power has occasionally been vested for a time in
the representatives of the nation. It has been thought better to introduce a
temporary confusion between the functions of the different authorities than to
violate the necessary principle of the unity of government.
England, France, and the United States have established this political
jurisdiction by law; and it is curious to examine the different adaptations
which these three great nations have made of the principle. In England and in
France the House of Lords and the Chambre des Paris *a constitute the highest
criminal court of their respective nations, and although they do not habitually
try all political offences, they are competent to try them all. Another
political body enjoys the right of impeachment before the House of Lords: the
only difference which exists between the two countries in this respect is, that
in England the Commons may impeach whomsoever they please before the Lords,
whilst in France the Deputies can only employ this mode of prosecution against
the ministers of the Crown.
a 
[ [As it existed under the constitutional monarchy down to 1848.]]
In both countries the Upper House may make use of all the existing penal laws
of the nation to punish the delinquents.
In the United States, as well as in Europe, one branch of the legislature is
authorized to impeach and another to judge: the House of Representatives
arraigns the offender, and the Senate awards his sentence. But the Senate can
only try such persons as are brought before it by the House of Representatives,
and those persons must belong to the class of public functionaries. Thus the
jurisdiction of the Senate is less extensive than that of the Peers of France,
whilst the right of impeachment by the Representatives is more general than
that of the Deputies. But the great difference which exists between Europe and
America is, that in Europe political tribunals are empowered to inflict all the
dispositions of the penal code, while in America, when they have deprived the
offender of his official rank, and have declared him incapable of filling any
political office for the future, their jurisdiction terminates and that of the
ordinary tribunals begins.
Suppose, for instance, that the President of the United States has committed
the crime of high treason; the House of Representatives impeaches him, and the
Senate degrades him; he must then be tried by a jury, which alone can deprive
him of his liberty or his life. This accurately illustrates the subject we are
treating. The political jurisdiction which is established by the laws of Europe
is intended to try great offenders, whatever may be their birth, their rank, or
their powers in the State; and to this end all the privileges of the courts of
justice are temporarily extended to a great political assembly. The legislator
is then transformed into the magistrate; he is called upon to admit, to
distinguish, and to punish the offence; and as he exercises all the authority
of a judge, the law restricts him to the observance of all the duties of that
high office, and of all the formalities of justice. When a public functionary
is impeached before an English or a French political tribunal, and is found
guilty, the sentence deprives him ipso facto of his functions, and it may
pronounce him to be incapable of resuming them or any others for the future.
But in this case the political interdict is a consequence of the sentence, and
not the sentence itself. In Europe the sentence of a political tribunal is to
be regarded as a judicial verdict rather than as an administrative measure. In
the United States the contrary takes place; and although the decision of the
Senate is judicial in its form, since the Senators are obliged to comply with
the practices and formalities of a court of justice; although it is judicial in
respect to the motives on which it is founded, since the Senate is in general
obliged to take an offence at common law as the basis of its sentence;
nevertheless the object of the proceeding is purely administrative. If it had
been the intention of the American legislator to invest a political body with
great judicial authority, its action would not have been limited to the circle
of public functionaries, since the most dangerous enemies of the State may be
in the possession of no functions at all; and this is especially true in
republics, where party influence is the first of authorities, and where the
strength of many a reader is increased by his exercising no legal power.
If it had been the intention of the American legislator to give society the
means of repressing State offences by exemplary punishment, according to the
practice of ordinary justice, the resources of the penal code would all have
been placed at the disposal of the political tribunals. But the weapon with
which they are intrusted is an imperfect one, and it can never reach the most
dangerous offenders, since men who aim at the entire subversion of the laws are
not likely to murmur at a political interdict.
The main object of the political jurisdiction which obtains in the United
States is, therefore, to deprive the ill-disposed citizen of an authority which
he has used amiss, and to prevent him from ever acquiring it again. This is
evidently an administrative measure sanctioned by the formalities of a judicial
decision. In this matter the Americans have created a mixed system; they have
surrounded the act which removes a public functionary with the securities of a
political trial; and they have deprived all political condemnations of their
severest penalties. Every link of the system may easily be traced from this
point; we at once perceive why the American constitutions subject all the civil
functionaries to the jurisdiction of the Senate, whilst the military, whose
crimes are nevertheless more formidable, are exempted from that tribunal. In
the civil service none of the American functionaries can be said to be
removable; the places which some of them occupy are inalienable, and the others
are chosen for a term which cannot be shortened. It is therefore necessary to
try them all in order to deprive them of their authority. But military officers
are dependent on the chief magistrate of the State, who is himself a civil
functionary, and the decision which condemns him is a blow upon them all.
If we now compare the American and the European systems, we shall meet with
differences no less striking in the different effects which each of them
produces or may produce. In France and in England the jurisdiction of political
bodies is looked upon as an extraordinary resource, which is only to be
employed in order to rescue society from unwonted dangers. It is not to be
denied that these tribunals, as they are constituted in Europe, are apt to
violate the conservative principle of the balance of power in the State, and to
threaten incessantly the lives and liberties of the subject. The same political
jurisdiction in the United States is only indirectly hostile to the balance of
power; it cannot menace the lives of the citizens, and it does not hover, as in
Europe, over the heads of the community, since those only who have submitted to
its authority on accepting office are exposed to the severity of its
investigations. It is at the same time less formidable and less efficacious;
indeed, it has not been considered by the legislators of the United States as a
remedy for the more violent evils of society, but as an ordinary means of
conducting the government. In this respect it probably exercises more real
influence on the social body in America than in Europe. We must not be misled
by the apparent mildness of the American legislation in all that relates to
political jurisdiction. It is to be observed, in the first place, that in the
United States the tribunal which passes sentence is composed of the same
elements, and subject to the same influences, as the body which impeaches the
offender, and that this uniformity gives an almost irresistible impulse to the
vindictive passions of parties. If political judges in the United States cannot
inflict such heavy penalties as those of Europe, there is the less chance of
their acquitting a prisoner; and the conviction, if it is less formidable, is
more certain. The principal object of the political tribunals of Europe is to
punish the offender; the purpose of those in America is to deprive him of his
authority. A political condemnation in the United States may, therefore, be
looked upon as a preventive measure; and there is no reason for restricting the
judges to the exact definitions of criminal law. Nothing can be more alarming
than the excessive latitude with which political offences are described in the
laws of America. Article II., Section 4, of the Constitution of the United
States runs thus:—“The President, Vice-President, and all civil
officers of the United States shall be removed from office on impeachment for,
and conviction of, treason, bribery, or other high crimes and
misdemeanors.” Many of the Constitutions of the States are even less
explicit. “Public officers,” says the Constitution of
Massachusetts, *b “shall be impeached for misconduct or
maladministration;” the Constitution of Virginia declares that all the
civil officers who shall have offended against the State, by maladministration,
corruption, or other high crimes, may be impeached by the House of Delegates;
in some constitutions no offences are specified, in order to subject the public
functionaries to an unlimited responsibility. *c But I will venture to affirm
that it is precisely their mildness which renders the American laws most
formidable in this respect. We have shown that in Europe the removal of a
functionary and his political interdiction are the consequences of the penalty
he is to undergo, and that in America they constitute the penalty itself. The
consequence is that in Europe political tribunals are invested with rights
which they are afraid to use, and that the fear of punishing too much hinders
them from punishing at all. But in America no one hesitates to inflict a
penalty from which humanity does not recoil. To condemn a political opponent to
death, in order to deprive him of his power, is to commit what all the world
would execrate as a horrible assassination; but to declare that opponent
unworthy to exercise that authority, to deprive him of it, and to leave him
uninjured in life and limb, may be judged to be the fair issue of the struggle.
But this sentence, which it is so easy to pronounce, is not the less fatally
severe to the majority of those upon whom it is inflicted. Great criminals may
undoubtedly brave its intangible rigor, but ordinary offenders will dread it as
a condemnation which destroys their position in the world, casts a blight upon
their honor, and condemns them to a shameful inactivity worse than death. The
influence exercised in the United States upon the progress of society by the
jurisdiction of political bodies may not appear to be formidable, but it is
only the more immense. It does not directly coerce the subject, but it renders
the majority more absolute over those in power; it does not confer an unbounded
authority on the legislator which can be exerted at some momentous crisis, but
it establishes a temperate and regular influence, which is at all times
available. If the power is decreased, it can, on the other hand, be more
conveniently employed and more easily abused. By preventing political tribunals
from inflicting judicial punishments the Americans seem to have eluded the
worst consequences of legislative tyranny, rather than tyranny itself; and I am
not sure that political jurisdiction, as it is constituted in the United
States, is not the most formidable weapon which has ever been placed in the
rude grasp of a popular majority. When the American republics begin to
degenerate it will be easy to verify the truth of this observation, by
remarking whether the number of political impeachments augments.*d

remark.—Translator’s Note, 1874.]]
I have hitherto considered each State as a separate whole, and I have explained
the different springs which the people sets in motion, and the different means
of action which it employs. But all the States which I have considered as
independent are forced to submit, in certain cases, to the supreme authority of
the Union. The time is now come for me to examine separately the supremacy with
which the Union has been invested, and to cast a rapid glance over the Federal
Constitution.
Origin of the first Union—Its weakness—Congress appeals to the
constituent authority—Interval of two years between this appeal and the
promulgation of the new Constitution.
History Of The Federal Constitution
The thirteen colonies which simultaneously threw off the yoke of England
towards the end of the last century professed, as I have already observed, the
same religion, the same language, the same customs, and almost the same laws;
they were struggling against a common enemy; and these reasons were
sufficiently strong to unite them one to another, and to consolidate them into
one nation. But as each of them had enjoyed a separate existence and a
government within its own control, the peculiar interests and customs which
resulted from this system were opposed to a compact and intimate union which
would have absorbed the individual importance of each in the general importance
of all. Hence arose two opposite tendencies, the one prompting the
Anglo-Americans to unite, the other to divide their strength. As long as the
war with the mother-country lasted the principle of union was kept alive by
necessity; and although the laws which constituted it were defective, the
common tie subsisted in spite of their imperfections. *a But no sooner was
peace concluded than the faults of the legislation became manifest, and the
State seemed to be suddenly dissolved. Each colony became an independent
republic, and assumed an absolute sovereignty. The federal government,
condemned to impotence by its constitution, and no longer sustained by the
presence of a common danger, witnessed the outrages offered to its flag by the
great nations of Europe, whilst it was scarcely able to maintain its ground
against the Indian tribes, and to pay the interest of the debt which had been
contracted during the war of independence. It was already on the verge of
destruction, when it officially proclaimed its inability to conduct the
government, and appealed to the constituent authority of the nation. *b If
America ever approached (for however brief a time) that lofty pinnacle of glory
to which the fancy of its inhabitants is wont to point, it was at the solemn
moment at which the power of the nation abdicated, as it were, the empire of
the land. All ages have furnished the spectacle of a people struggling with
energy to win its independence; and the efforts of the Americans in throwing
off the English yoke have been considerably exaggerated. Separated from their
enemies by three thousand miles of ocean, and backed by a powerful ally, the
success of the United States may be more justly attributed to their
geographical position than to the valor of their armies or the patriotism of
their citizens. It would be ridiculous to compare the American was to the wars
of the French Revolution, or the efforts of the Americans to those of the
French when they were attacked by the whole of Europe, without credit and
without allies, yet capable of opposing a twentieth part of their population to
the world, and of bearing the torch of revolution beyond their frontiers whilst
they stifled its devouring flame within the bosom of their country. But it is a
novelty in the history of society to see a great people turn a calm and
scrutinizing eye upon itself, when apprised by the legislature that the wheels
of government are stopped; to see it carefully examine the extent of the evil,
and patiently wait for two whole years until a remedy was discovered, which it
voluntarily adopted without having wrung a tear or a drop of blood from
mankind. At the time when the inadequacy of the first constitution was
discovered America possessed the double advantage of that calm which had
succeeded the effervescence of the revolution, and of those great men who had
led the revolution to a successful issue. The assembly which accepted the task
of composing the second constitution was small; *c but George Washington was
its President, and it contained the choicest talents and the noblest hearts
which had ever appeared in the New World. This national commission, after long
and mature deliberation, offered to the acceptance of the people the body of
general laws which still rules the Union. All the States adopted it
successively. *d The new Federal Government commenced its functions in 1789,
after an interregnum of two years. The Revolution of America terminated when
that of France began.
a 
[ See the articles of the first confederation formed in 1778. This constitution
was not adopted by all the States until 1781. See also the analysis given of
this constitution in “The Federalist” from No. 15 to No. 22,
inclusive, and Story’s “Commentaries on the Constitution of the
United States,” pp. 85-115.]

c

two Morrises were amongst the number.]
d

elected by the people for this sole purpose; and the new constitution was
discussed at length in each of these assemblies.]
Division of authority between the Federal Government and the States—The
Government of the States is the rule, the Federal Government the exception.
The first question which awaited the Americans was intricate, and by no means
easy of solution: the object was so to divide the authority of the different
States which composed the Union that each of them should continue to govern
itself in all that concerned its internal prosperity, whilst the entire nation,
represented by the Union, should continue to form a compact body, and to
provide for the general exigencies of the people. It was as impossible to
determine beforehand, with any degree of accuracy, the share of authority which
each of two governments was to enjoy, as to foresee all the incidents in the
existence of a nation.
The obligations and the claims of the Federal Government were simple and easily
definable, because the Union had been formed with the express purpose of
meeting the general exigencies of the people; but the claims and obligations of
the States were, on the other hand, complicated and various, because those
Governments had penetrated into all the details of social life. The attributes
of the Federal Government were therefore carefully enumerated and all that was
not included amongst them was declared to constitute a part of the privileges
of the several Governments of the States. Thus the government of the States
remained the rule, and that of the Confederation became the exception. *e
e 
[ See the Amendment to the Federal Constitution; “Federalist,” No.
32; Story, p. 711; Kent’s “Commentaries,” vol. i. p. 364.
It is to be observed that whenever the exclusive right of regulating certain
matters is not reserved to Congress by the Constitution, the States may take up
the affair until it is brought before the National Assembly. For instance,
Congress has the right of making a general law on bankruptcy, which, however,
it neglects to do. Each State is then at liberty to make a law for itself. This
point has been established by discussion in the law-courts, and may be said to
belong more properly to jurisprudence.]
But as it was foreseen that, in practice, questions might arise as to the exact
limits of this exceptional authority, and that it would be dangerous to submit
these questions to the decision of the ordinary courts of justice, established
in the States by the States themselves, a high Federal court was created, *f
which was destined, amongst other functions, to maintain the balance of power
which had been established by the Constitution between the two rival
Governments. *g
f 
[ The action of this court is indirect, as we shall hereafter show.]
g 
[ It is thus that “The Federalist,” No. 45, explains the division
of supremacy between the Union and the States: “The powers delegated by
the Constitution to the Federal Government are few and defined. Those which are
to remain in the State Governments are numerous and indefinite. The former will
be exercised principally on external objects, as war, peace, negotiation, and
foreign commerce. The powers reserved to the several States will extend to all
the objects which, in the ordinary course of affairs, concern the internal
order and prosperity of the State.” I shall often have occasion to quote
“The Federalist” in this work. When the bill which has since become
the Constitution of the United States was submitted to the approval of the
people, and the discussions were still pending, three men, who had already
acquired a portion of that celebrity which they have since enjoyed—John
Jay, Hamilton, and Madison—formed an association with the intention of
explaining to the nation the advantages of the measure which was proposed. With
this view they published a series of articles in the shape of a journal, which
now form a complete treatise. They entitled their journal “The
Federalist,” a name which has been retained in the work. “The
Federalist” is an excellent book, which ought to be familiar to the
statesmen of all countries, although it especially concerns America.]
Prerogative Of The Federal Government
Power of declaring war, making peace, and levying general taxes vested in the
Federal Government—What part of the internal policy of the country it may
direct—The Government of the Union in some respects more central than the
King’s Government in the old French monarchy.
The external relations of a people may be compared to those of private
individuals, and they cannot be advantageously maintained without the agency of
a single head of a Government. The exclusive right of making peace and war, of
concluding treaties of commerce, of raising armies, and equipping fleets, was
granted to the Union. *h The necessity of a national Government was less
imperiously felt in the conduct of the internal policy of society; but there
are certain general interests which can only be attended to with advantage by a
general authority. The Union was invested with the power of controlling the
monetary system, of directing the post office, and of opening the great roads
which were to establish a communication between the different parts of the
country. *i The independence of the Government of each State was formally
recognized in its sphere; nevertheless, the Federal Government was authorized
to interfere in the internal affairs of the States *j in a few predetermined
cases, in which an indiscreet abuse of their independence might compromise the
security of the Union at large. Thus, whilst the power of modifying and
changing their legislation at pleasure was preserved in all the republics, they
were forbidden to enact ex post facto laws, or to create a class of nobles in
their community. *k Lastly, as it was necessary that the Federal Government
should be able to fulfil its engagements, it was endowed with an unlimited
power of levying taxes. *l

In examining the balance of power as established by the Federal Constitution;
in remarking on the one hand the portion of sovereignty which has been reserved
to the several States, and on the other the share of power which the Union has
assumed, it is evident that the Federal legislators entertained the clearest
and most accurate notions on the nature of the centralization of government.
The United States form not only a republic, but a confederation; nevertheless
the authority of the nation is more central than it was in several of the
monarchies of Europe when the American Constitution was formed. Take, for
instance, the two following examples.
Thirteen supreme courts of justice existed in France, which, generally
speaking, had the right of interpreting the law without appeal; and those
provinces which were styled pays d’etats were authorized to refuse their
assent to an impost which had been levied by the sovereign who represented the
nation. In the Union there is but one tribunal to interpret, as there is one
legislature to make the laws; and an impost voted by the representatives of the
nation is binding upon all the citizens. In these two essential points,
therefore, the Union exercises more central authority than the French monarchy
possessed, although the Union is only an assemblage of confederate republics.
In Spain certain provinces had the right of establishing a system of
custom-house duties peculiar to themselves, although that privilege belongs, by
its very nature, to the national sovereignty. In America the Congress alone has
the right of regulating the commercial relations of the States. The government
of the Confederation is therefore more centralized in this respect than the
kingdom of Spain. It is true that the power of the Crown in France or in Spain
was always able to obtain by force whatever the Constitution of the country
denied, and that the ultimate result was consequently the same; but I am here
discussing the theory of the Constitution.
Federal Powers
After having settled the limits within which the Federal Government was to act,
the next point was to determine the powers which it was to exert.
Legislative Powers *m
m 
[ [In this chapter the author points out the essence of the conflict between
the seceding States and the Union which caused the Civil War of 1861.]]
Division of the Legislative Body into two branches—Difference in the
manner of forming the two Houses—The principle of the independence of the
States predominates in the formation of the Senate—The principle of the
sovereignty of the nation in the composition of the House of
Representatives—Singular effects of the fact that a Constitution can only
be logical in the early stages of a nation.
The plan which had been laid down beforehand for the Constitutions of the
several States was followed, in many points, in the organization of the powers
of the Union. The Federal legislature of the Union was composed of a Senate and
a House of Representatives. A spirit of conciliation prescribed the observance
of distinct principles in the formation of these two assemblies. I have already
shown that two contrary interests were opposed to each other in the
establishment of the Federal Constitution. These two interests had given rise
to two opinions. It was the wish of one party to convert the Union into a
league of independent States, or a sort of congress, at which the
representatives of the several peoples would meet to discuss certain points of
their common interests. The other party desired to unite the inhabitants of the
American colonies into one sole nation, and to establish a Government which
should act as the sole representative of the nation, as far as the limited
sphere of its authority would permit. The practical consequences of these two
theories were exceedingly different.
The question was, whether a league was to be established instead of a national
Government; whether the majority of the State, instead of the majority of the
inhabitants of the Union, was to give the law: for every State, the small as
well as the great, would then remain in the full enjoyment of its independence,
and enter the Union upon a footing of perfect equality. If, however, the
inhabitants of the United States were to be considered as belonging to one and
the same nation, it would be just that the majority of the citizens of the
Union should prescribe the law. Of course the lesser States could not subscribe
to the application of this doctrine without, in fact, abdicating their
existence in relation to the sovereignty of the Confederation; since they would
have passed from the condition of a co-equal and co-legislative authority to
that of an insignificant fraction of a great people. But if the former system
would have invested them with an excessive authority, the latter would have
annulled their influence altogether. Under these circumstances the result was,
that the strict rules of logic were evaded, as is usually the case when
interests are opposed to arguments. A middle course was hit upon by the
legislators, which brought together by force two systems theoretically
irreconcilable.
The principle of the independence of the States prevailed in the formation of
the Senate, and that of the sovereignty of the nation predominated in the
composition of the House of Representatives. It was decided that each State
should send two senators to Congress, and a number of representatives
proportioned to its population. *n It results from this arrangement that the
State of New York has at the present day forty representatives and only two
senators; the State of Delaware has two senators and only one representative;
the State of Delaware is therefore equal to the State of New York in the
Senate, whilst the latter has forty times the influence of the former in the
House of Representatives. Thus, if the minority of the nation preponderates in
the Senate,. it may paralyze the decisions of the majority represented in the
other House, which is contrary to the spirit of constitutional government.
n 
[ Every ten years Congress fixes anew the number of representatives which each
State is to furnish. The total number was 69 in 1789, and 240 in 1833. (See
“American Almanac,” 1834, p. 194.) The Constitution decided that
there should not be more than one representative for every 30,000 persons; but
no minimum was fixed on. The Congress has not thought fit to augment the number
of representatives in proportion to the increase of population. The first Act
which was passed on the subject (April 14, 1792: see “Laws of the United
States,” by Story, vol. i. p. 235) decided that there should be one
representative for every 33,000 inhabitants. The last Act, which was passed in
1832, fixes the proportion at one for 48,000. The population represented is
composed of all the free men and of three-fifths of the slaves.
[The last Act of apportionment, passed February 2, 1872, fixes the
representation at one to 134,684 inhabitants. There are now (1875) 283 members
of the lower House of Congress, and 9 for the States at large, making in all
292 members. The old States have of course lost the representatives which the
new States have gained.—Translator’s Note.]]
These facts show how rare and how difficult it is rationally and logically to
combine all the several parts of legislation. In the course of time different
interests arise, and different principles are sanctioned by the same people;
and when a general constitution is to be established, these interests and
principles are so many natural obstacles to the rigorous application of any
political system, with all its consequences. The early stages of national
existence are the only periods at which it is possible to maintain the complete
logic of legislation; and when we perceive a nation in the enjoyment of this
advantage, before we hasten to conclude that it is wise, we should do well to
remember that it is young. When the Federal Constitution was formed, the
interests of independence for the separate States, and the interest of union
for the whole people, were the only two conflicting interests which existed
amongst the Anglo-Americans, and a compromise was necessarily made between
them.
It is, however, just to acknowledge that this part of the Constitution has not
hitherto produced those evils which might have been feared. All the States are
young and contiguous; their customs, their ideas, and their exigencies are not
dissimilar; and the differences which result from their size or inferiority do
not suffice to set their interests at variance. The small States have
consequently never been induced to league themselves together in the Senate to
oppose the designs of the larger ones; and indeed there is so irresistible an
authority in the legitimate expression of the will of a people that the Senate
could offer but a feeble opposition to the vote of the majority of the House of
Representatives.
It must not be forgotten, on the other hand, that it was not in the power of
the American legislators to reduce to a single nation the people for whom they
were making laws. The object of the Federal Constitution was not to destroy the
independence of the States, but to restrain it. By acknowledging the real
authority of these secondary communities (and it was impossible to deprive them
of it), they disavowed beforehand the habitual use of constraint in enforcing g
the decisions of the majority. Upon this principle the introduction of the
influence of the States into the mechanism of the Federal Government was by no
means to be wondered at, since it only attested the existence of an
acknowledged power, which was to be humored and not forcibly checked.
A Further Difference Between The Senate And The House Of Representatives
The Senate named by the provincial legislators, the Representatives by the
people—Double election of the former; single election of the
latter—Term of the different offices—Peculiar functions of each
House.
The Senate not only differs from the other House in the principle which it
represents, but also in the mode of its election, in the term for which it is
chosen, and in the nature of its functions. The House of Representatives is
named by the people, the Senate by the legislators of each State; the former is
directly elected, the latter is elected by an elected body; the term for which
the representatives are chosen is only two years, that of the senators is six.
The functions of the House of Representatives are purely legislative, and the
only share it takes in the judicial power is in the impeachment of public
officers. The Senate co-operates in the work of legislation, and tries those
political offences which the House of Representatives submits to its decision.
It also acts as the great executive council of the nation; the treaties which
are concluded by the President must be ratified by the Senate, and the
appointments he may make must be definitely approved by the same body. *o

Dependence of the President—He is elective and responsible—He is
free to act in his own sphere under the inspection, but not under the
direction, of the Senate—His salary fixed at his entry into
office—Suspensive veto.
The American legislators undertook a difficult task in attempting to create an
executive power dependent on the majority of the people, and nevertheless
sufficiently strong to act without restraint in its own sphere. It was
indispensable to the maintenance of the republican form of government that the
representative of the executive power should be subject to the will of the
nation.
The President is an elective magistrate. His honor, his property, his liberty,
and his life are the securities which the people has for the temperate use of
his power. But in the exercise of his authority he cannot be said to be
perfectly independent; the Senate takes cognizance of his relations with
foreign powers, and of the distribution of public appointments, so that he can
neither be bribed nor can he employ the means of corruption. The legislators of
the Union acknowledged that the executive power would be incompetent to fulfil
its task with dignity and utility, unless it enjoyed a greater degree of
stability and of strength than had been granted to it in the separate States.
The President is chosen for four years, and he may be reelected; so that the
chances of a prolonged administration may inspire him with hopeful undertakings
for the public good, and with the means of carrying them into execution. The
President was made the sole representative of the executive power of the Union,
and care was taken not to render his decisions subordinate to the vote of a
council—a dangerous measure, which tends at the same time to clog the
action of the Government and to diminish its responsibility. The Senate has the
right of annulling g certain acts of the President; but it cannot compel him to
take any steps, nor does it participate in the exercise of the executive power.
The action of the legislature on the executive power may be direct; and we have
just shown that the Americans carefully obviated this influence; but it may, on
the other hand, be indirect. Public assemblies which have the power of
depriving an officer of state of his salary encroach upon his independence; and
as they are free to make the laws, it is to be feared lest they should
gradually appropriate to themselves a portion of that authority which the
Constitution had vested in his hands. This dependence of the executive power is
one of the defects inherent in republican constitutions. The Americans have not
been able to counteract the tendency which legislative assemblies have to get
possession of the government, but they have rendered this propensity less
irresistible. The salary of the President is fixed, at the time of his entering
upon office, for the whole period of his magistracy. The President is,
moreover, provided with a suspensive veto, which allows him to oppose the
passing of such laws as might destroy the portion of independence which the
Constitution awards him. The struggle between the President and the legislature
must always be an unequal one, since the latter is certain of bearing down all
resistance by persevering in its plans; but the suspensive veto forces it at
least to reconsider the matter, and, if the motion be persisted in, it must
then be backed by a majority of two-thirds of the whole house. The veto is, in
fact, a sort of appeal to the people. The executive power, which, without this
security, might have been secretly oppressed, adopts this means of pleading its
cause and stating its motives. But if the legislature is certain of
overpowering all resistance by persevering in its plans, I reply, that in the
constitutions of all nations, of whatever kind they may be, a certain point
exists at which the legislator is obliged to have recourse to the good sense
and the virtue of his fellow-citizens. This point is more prominent and more
discoverable in republics, whilst it is more remote and more carefully
concealed in monarchies, but it always exists somewhere. There is no country in
the world in which everything can be provided for by the laws, or in which
political institutions can prove a substitute for common sense and public
morality.
Differences Between The Position Of The President Of The United States And That
Of A Constitutional King Of France
Executive power in the Northern States as limited and as partial as the
supremacy which it represents—Executive power in France as universal as
the supremacy it represents—The King a branch of the
legislature—The President the mere executor of the law—Other
differences resulting from the duration of the two powers—The President
checked in the exercise of the executive authority—The King independent
in its exercise—Notwithstanding these discrepancies France is more akin
to a republic than the Union to a monarchy—Comparison of the number of
public officers depending upon the executive power in the two countries.
The executive power has so important an influence on the destinies of nations
that I am inclined to pause for an instant at this portion of my subject, in
order more clearly to explain the part it sustains in America. In order to form
an accurate idea of the position of the President of the United States, it may
not be irrelevant to compare it to that of one of the constitutional kings of
Europe. In this comparison I shall pay but little attention to the external
signs of power, which are more apt to deceive the eye of the observer than to
guide his researches. When a monarchy is being gradually transformed into a
republic, the executive power retains the titles, the honors, the etiquette,
and even the funds of royalty long after its authority has disappeared. The
English, after having cut off the head of one king and expelled another from
his throne, were accustomed to accost the successor of those princes upon their
knees. On the other hand, when a republic falls under the sway of a single
individual, the demeanor of the sovereign is simple and unpretending, as if his
authority was not yet paramount. When the emperors exercised an unlimited
control over the fortunes and the lives of their fellow-citizens, it was
customary to call them Caesar in conversation, and they were in the habit of
supping without formality at their friends’ houses. It is therefore
necessary to look below the surface.
The sovereignty of the United States is shared between the Union and the
States, whilst in France it is undivided and compact: hence arises the first
and the most notable difference which exists between the President of the
United States and the King of France. In the United States the executive power
is as limited and partial as the sovereignty of the Union in whose name it
acts; in France it is as universal as the authority of the State. The Americans
have a federal and the French a national Government.
This cause of inferiority results from the nature of things, but it is not the
only one; the second in importance is as follows: Sovereignty may be defined to
be the right of making laws: in France, the King really exercises a portion of
the sovereign power, since the laws have no weight till he has given his assent
to them; he is, moreover, the executor of all they ordain. The President is
also the executor of the laws, but he does not really co-operate in their
formation, since the refusal of his assent does not annul them. He is therefore
merely to be considered as the agent of the sovereign power. But not only does
the King of France exercise a portion of the sovereign power, he also
contributes to the nomination of the legislature, which exercises the other
portion. He has the privilege of appointing the members of one chamber, and of
dissolving the other at his pleasure; whereas the President of the United
States has no share in the formation of the legislative body, and cannot
dissolve any part of it. The King has the same right of bringing forward
measures as the Chambers; a right which the President does not possess. The
King is represented in each assembly by his ministers, who explain his
intentions, support his opinions, and maintain the principles of the
Government. The President and his ministers are alike excluded from Congress;
so that his influence and his opinions can only penetrate indirectly into that
great body. The King of France is therefore on an equal footing with the
legislature, which can no more act without him than he can without it. The
President exercises an authority inferior to, and depending upon, that of the
legislature.
Even in the exercise of the executive power, properly so called—the point
upon which his position seems to be most analogous to that of the King of
France—the President labors under several causes of inferiority. The
authority of the King, in France, has, in the first place, the advantage of
duration over that of the President, and durability is one of the chief
elements of strength; nothing is either loved or feared but what is likely to
endure. The President of the United States is a magistrate elected for four
years; the King, in France, is an hereditary sovereign. In the exercise of the
executive power the President of the United States is constantly subject to a
jealous scrutiny. He may make, but he cannot conclude, a treaty; he may
designate, but he cannot appoint, a public officer. *q The King of France is
absolute within the limits of his authority. The President of the United States
is responsible for his actions; but the person of the King is declared
inviolable by the French Charter. *r
q 
[ The Constitution had left it doubtful whether the President was obliged to
consult the Senate in the removal as well as in the appointment of Federal
officers. “The Federalist” (No. 77) seemed to establish the
affirmative; but in 1789 Congress formally decided that, as the President was
responsible for his actions, he ought not to be forced to employ agents who had
forfeited his esteem. See Kent’s “Commentaries”, vol. i. p.
289.]
r 
[ [This comparison applied to the Constitutional King of France and to the
powers he held under the Charter of 1830, till the overthrow of the monarchy in
1848.—Translator’s Note.]]
Nevertheless, the supremacy of public opinion is no less above the head of the
one than of the other. This power is less definite, less evident, and less
sanctioned by the laws in France than in America, but in fact it exists. In
America, it acts by elections and decrees; in France it proceeds by
revolutions; but notwithstanding the different constitutions of these two
countries, public opinion is the predominant authority in both of them. The
fundamental principle of legislation—a principle essentially
republican—is the same in both countries, although its consequences may
be different, and its results more or less extensive. Whence I am led to
conclude that France with its King is nearer akin to a republic than the Union
with its President is to a monarchy.
In what I have been saying I have only touched upon the main points of
distinction; and if I could have entered into details, the contrast would have
been rendered still more striking. I have remarked that the authority of the
President in the United States is only exercised within the limits of a partial
sovereignty, whilst that of the King in France is undivided. I might have gone
on to show that the power of the King’s government in France exceeds its
natural limits, however extensive they may be, and penetrates in a thousand
different ways into the administration of private interests. Amongst the
examples of this influence may be quoted that which results from the great
number of public functionaries, who all derive their appointments from the
Government. This number now exceeds all previous limits; it amounts to 138,000
*s nominations, each of which may be considered as an element of power. The
President of the United States has not the exclusive right of making any public
appointments, and their whole number scarcely exceeds 12,000. *t
s 
[ The sums annually paid by the State to these officers amount to 200,000,000
fr. ($40,000,000).]
t 
[ This number is extracted from the “National Calendar” for 1833.
The “National Calendar” is an American almanac which contains the
names of all the Federal officers. It results from this comparison that the
King of France has eleven times as many places at his disposal as the
President, although the population of France is not much more than double that
of the Union.
[I have not the means of ascertaining the number of appointments now at the
disposal of the President of the United States, but his patronage and the abuse
of it have largely increased since 1833.—Translator’s Note, 1875.]]
Accidental Causes Which May Increase The Influence Of The Executive Government
External security of the Union—Army of six thousand men—Few
ships—The President has no opportunity of exercising his great
prerogatives—In the prerogatives he exercises he is weak.
If the executive government is feebler in America than in France, the cause is
more attributable to the circumstances than to the laws of the country.
It is chiefly in its foreign relations that the executive power of a nation is
called upon to exert its skill and its vigor. If the existence of the Union
were perpetually threatened, and if its chief interests were in daily
connection with those of other powerful nations, the executive government would
assume an increased importance in proportion to the measures expected of it,
and those which it would carry into effect. The President of the United States
is the commander-in-chief of the army, but of an army composed of only six
thousand men; he commands the fleet, but the fleet reckons but few sail; he
conducts the foreign relations of the Union, but the United States are a nation
without neighbors. Separated from the rest of the world by the ocean, and too
weak as yet to aim at the dominion of the seas, they have no enemies, and their
interests rarely come into contact with those of any other nation of the globe.
The practical part of a Government must not be judged by the theory of its
constitution. The President of the United States is in the possession of almost
royal prerogatives, which he has no opportunity of exercising; and those
privileges which he can at present use are very circumscribed. The laws allow
him to possess a degree of influence which circumstances do not permit him to
employ.
On the other hand, the great strength of the royal prerogative in France arises
from circumstances far more than from the laws. There the executive government
is constantly struggling against prodigious obstacles, and exerting all its
energies to repress them; so that it increases by the extent of its
achievements, and by the importance of the events it controls, without
modifying its constitution. If the laws had made it as feeble and as
circumscribed as it is in the Union, its influence would very soon become still
more preponderant.
Why The President Of The United States Does Not Require The Majority Of The Two
Houses In Order To Carry On The Government It is an established axiom in Europe
that a constitutional King cannot persevere in a system of government which is
opposed by the two other branches of the legislature. But several Presidents of
the United States have been known to lose the majority in the legislative body
without being obliged to abandon the supreme power, and without inflicting a
serious evil upon society. I have heard this fact quoted as an instance of the
independence and the power of the executive government in America: a
moment’s reflection will convince us, on the contrary, that it is a proof
of its extreme weakness.
A King in Europe requires the support of the legislature to enable him to
perform the duties imposed upon him by the Constitution, because those duties
are enormous. A constitutional King in Europe is not merely the executor of the
law, but the execution of its provisions devolves so completely upon him that
he has the power of paralyzing its influence if it opposes his designs. He
requires the assistance of the legislative assemblies to make the law, but
those assemblies stand in need of his aid to execute it: these two authorities
cannot subsist without each other, and the mechanism of government is stopped
as soon as they are at variance.
In America the President cannot prevent any law from being passed, nor can he
evade the obligation of enforcing it. His sincere and zealous co-operation is
no doubt useful, but it is not indispensable, in the carrying on of public
affairs. All his important acts are directly or indirectly submitted to the
legislature, and of his own free authority he can do but little. It is
therefore his weakness, and not his power, which enables him to remain in
opposition to Congress. In Europe, harmony must reign between the Crown and the
other branches of the legislature, because a collision between them may prove
serious; in America, this harmony is not indispensable, because such a
collision is impossible.
Election Of The President
Dangers of the elective system increase in proportion to the extent of the
prerogative—This system possible in America because no powerful executive
authority is required—What circumstances are favorable to the elective
system—Why the election of the President does not cause a deviation from
the principles of the Government—Influence of the election of the
President on secondary functionaries.
The dangers of the system of election applied to the head of the executive
government of a great people have been sufficiently exemplified by experience
and by history, and the remarks I am about to make refer to America alone.
These dangers may be more or less formidable in proportion to the place which
the executive power occupies, and to the importance it possesses in the State;
and they may vary according to the mode of election and the circumstances in
which the electors are placed. The most weighty argument against the election
of a chief magistrate is, that it offers so splendid a lure to private
ambition, and is so apt to inflame men in the pursuit of power, that when
legitimate means are wanting force may not unfrequently seize what right
denied.
It is clear that the greater the privileges of the executive authority are, the
greater is the temptation; the more the ambition of the candidates is excited,
the more warmly are their interests espoused by a throng of partisans who hope
to share the power when their patron has won the prize. The dangers of the
elective system increase, therefore, in the exact ratio of the influence
exercised by the executive power in the affairs of State. The revolutions of
Poland were not solely attributable to the elective system in general, but to
the fact that the elected monarch was the sovereign of a powerful kingdom.
Before we can discuss the absolute advantages of the elective system we must
make preliminary inquiries as to whether the geographical position, the laws,
the habits, the manners, and the opinions of the people amongst whom it is to
be introduced will admit of the establishment of a weak and dependent executive
government; for to attempt to render the representative of the State a powerful
sovereign, and at the same time elective, is, in my opinion, to entertain two
incompatible designs. To reduce hereditary royalty to the condition of an
elective authority, the only means that I am acquainted with are to
circumscribe its sphere of action beforehand, gradually to diminish its
prerogatives, and to accustom the people to live without its protection.
Nothing, however, is further from the designs of the republicans of Europe than
this course: as many of them owe their hatred of tyranny to the sufferings
which they have personally undergone, it is oppression, and not the extent of
the executive power, which excites their hostility, and they attack the former
without perceiving how nearly it is connected with the latter.
Hitherto no citizen has shown any disposition to expose his honor and his life
in order to become the President of the United States; because the power of
that office is temporary, limited, and subordinate. The prize of fortune must
be great to encourage adventurers in so desperate a game. No candidate has as
yet been able to arouse the dangerous enthusiasm or the passionate sympathies
of the people in his favor, for the very simple reason that when he is at the
head of the Government he has but little power, but little wealth, and but
little glory to share amongst his friends; and his influence in the State is
too small for the success or the ruin of a faction to depend upon the elevation
of an individual to power.
The great advantage of hereditary monarchies is, that as the private interest
of a family is always intimately connected with the interests of the State, the
executive government is never suspended for a single instant; and if the
affairs of a monarchy are not better conducted than those of a republic, at
least there is always some one to conduct them, well or ill, according to his
capacity. In elective States, on the contrary, the wheels of government cease
to act, as it were, of their own accord at the approach of an election, and
even for some time previous to that event. The laws may indeed accelerate the
operation of the election, which may be conducted with such simplicity and
rapidity that the seat of power will never be left vacant; but, notwithstanding
these precautions, a break necessarily occurs in the minds of the people.
At the approach of an election the head of the executive government is wholly
occupied by the coming struggle; his future plans are doubtful; he can
undertake nothing new, and the he will only prosecute with indifference those
designs which another will perhaps terminate. “I am so near the time of
my retirement from office,” said President Jefferson on the 21st of
January, 1809 (six weeks before the election), “that I feel no passion, I
take no part, I express no sentiment. It appears to me just to leave to my
successor the commencement of those measures which he will have to prosecute,
and for which he will be responsible.”
On the other hand, the eyes of the nation are centred on a single point; all
are watching the gradual birth of so important an event. The wider the
influence of the executive power extends, the greater and the more necessary is
its constant action, the more fatal is the term of suspense; and a nation which
is accustomed to the government, or, still more, one used to the administrative
protection of a powerful executive authority would be infallibly convulsed by
an election of this kind. In the United States the action of the Government may
be slackened with impunity, because it is always weak and circumscribed. *u
u 
[ [This, however, may be a great danger. The period during which Mr. Buchanan
retained office, after the election of Mr. Lincoln, from November, 1860, to
March, 1861, was that which enabled the seceding States of the South to
complete their preparations for the Civil War, and the Executive Government was
paralyzed. No greater evil could befall a nation.—Translator’s
Note.]]
One of the principal vices of the elective system is that it always introduces
a certain degree of instability into the internal and external policy of the
State. But this disadvantage is less sensibly felt if the share of power vested
in the elected magistrate is small. In Rome the principles of the Government
underwent no variation, although the Consuls were changed every year, because
the Senate, which was an hereditary assembly, possessed the directing
authority. If the elective system were adopted in Europe, the condition of most
of the monarchical States would be changed at every new election. In America
the President exercises a certain influence on State affairs, but he does not
conduct them; the preponderating power is vested in the representatives of the
whole nation. The political maxims of the country depend therefore on the mass
of the people, not on the President alone; and consequently in America the
elective system has no very prejudicial influence on the fixed principles of
the Government. But the want of fixed principles is an evil so inherent in the
elective system that it is still extremely perceptible in the narrow sphere to
which the authority of the President extends.
The Americans have admitted that the head of the executive power, who has to
bear the whole responsibility of the duties he is called upon to fulfil, ought
to be empowered to choose his own agents, and to remove them at pleasure: the
legislative bodies watch the conduct of the President more than they direct it.
The consequence of this arrangement is, that at every new election the fate of
all the Federal public officers is in suspense. Mr. Quincy Adams, on his entry
into office, discharged the majority of the individuals who had been appointed
by his predecessor: and I am not aware that General Jackson allowed a single
removable functionary employed in the Federal service to retain his place
beyond the first year which succeeded his election. It is sometimes made a
subject of complaint that in the constitutional monarchies of Europe the fate
of the humbler servants of an Administration depends upon that of the
Ministers. But in elective Governments this evil is far greater. In a
constitutional monarchy successive ministries are rapidly formed; but as the
principal representative of the executive power does not change, the spirit of
innovation is kept within bounds; the changes which take place are in the
details rather than in the principles of the administrative system; but to
substitute one system for another, as is done in America every four years, by
law, is to cause a sort of revolution. As to the misfortunes which may fall
upon individuals in consequence of this state of things, it must be allowed
that the uncertain situation of the public officers is less fraught with evil
consequences in America than elsewhere. It is so easy to acquire an independent
position in the United States that the public officer who loses his place may
be deprived of the comforts of life, but not of the means of subsistence.
I remarked at the beginning of this chapter that the dangers of the elective
system applied to the head of the State are augmented or decreased by the
peculiar circumstances of the people which adopts it. However the functions of
the executive power may be restricted, it must always exercise a great
influence upon the foreign policy of the country, for a negotiation cannot be
opened or successfully carried on otherwise than by a single agent. The more
precarious and the more perilous the position of a people becomes, the more
absolute is the want of a fixed and consistent external policy, and the more
dangerous does the elective system of the Chief Magistrate become. The policy
of the Americans in relation to the whole world is exceedingly simple; for it
may almost be said that no country stands in need of them, nor do they require
the co-operation of any other people. Their independence is never threatened.
In their present condition, therefore, the functions of the executive power are
no less limited by circumstances than by the laws; and the President may
frequently change his line of policy without involving the State in difficulty
or destruction.
Whatever the prerogatives of the executive power may be, the period which
immediately precedes an election and the moment of its duration must always be
considered as a national crisis, which is perilous in proportion to the
internal embarrassments and the external dangers of the country. Few of the
nations of Europe could escape the calamities of anarchy or of conquest every
time they might have to elect a new sovereign. In America society is so
constituted that it can stand without assistance upon its own basis; nothing is
to be feared from the pressure of external dangers, and the election of the
President is a cause of agitation, but not of ruin.
Mode Of Election
Skill of the American legislators shown in the mode of election adopted by
them—Creation of a special electoral body—Separate votes of these
electors—Case in which the House of Representatives is called upon to
choose the President—Results of the twelve elections which have taken
place since the Constitution has been established.
Besides the dangers which are inherent in the system, many other difficulties
may arise from the mode of election, which may be obviated by the precaution of
the legislator. When a people met in arms on some public spot to choose its
head, it was exposed to all the chances of civil war resulting from so martial
a mode of proceeding, besides the dangers of the elective system in itself. The
Polish laws, which subjected the election of the sovereign to the veto of a
single individual, suggested the murder of that individual or prepared the way
to anarchy.
In the examination of the institutions and the political as well as social
condition of the United States, we are struck by the admirable harmony of the
gifts of fortune and the efforts of man. The nation possessed two of the main
causes of internal peace; it was a new country, but it was inhabited by a
people grown old in the exercise of freedom. America had no hostile neighbors
to dread; and the American legislators, profiting by these favorable
circumstances, created a weak and subordinate executive power which could
without danger be made elective.
It then only remained for them to choose the least dangerous of the various
modes of election; and the rules which they laid down upon this point admirably
correspond to the securities which the physical and political constitution of
the country already afforded. Their object was to find the mode of election
which would best express the choice of the people with the least possible
excitement and suspense. It was admitted in the first place that the simple
majority should be decisive; but the difficulty was to obtain this majority
without an interval of delay which it was most important to avoid. It rarely
happens that an individual can at once collect the majority of the suffrages of
a great people; and this difficulty is enhanced in a republic of confederate
States, where local influences are apt to preponderate. The means by which it
was proposed to obviate this second obstacle was to delegate the electoral
powers of the nation to a body of representatives. This mode of election
rendered a majority more probable; for the fewer the electors are, the greater
is the chance of their coming to a final decision. It also offered an
additional probability of a judicious choice. It then remained to be decided
whether this right of election was to be entrusted to a legislative body, the
habitual representative assembly of the nation, or whether an electoral
assembly should be formed for the express purpose of proceeding to the
nomination of a President. The Americans chose the latter alternative, from a
belief that the individuals who were returned to make the laws were incompetent
to represent the wishes of the nation in the election of its chief magistrate;
and that, as they are chosen for more than a year, the constituency they
represent might have changed its opinion in that time. It was thought that if
the legislature was empowered to elect the head of the executive power, its
members would, for some time before the election, be exposed to the manoeuvres
of corruption and the tricks of intrigue; whereas the special electors would,
like a jury, remain mixed up with the crowd till the day of action, when they
would appear for the sole purpose of giving their votes.
It was therefore established that every State should name a certain number of
electors, *v who in their turn should elect the President; and as it had been
observed that the assemblies to which the choice of a chief magistrate had been
entrusted in elective countries inevitably became the centres of passion and of
cabal; that they sometimes usurped an authority which did not belong to them;
and that their proceedings, or the uncertainty which resulted from them, were
sometimes prolonged so much as to endanger the welfare of the State, it was
determined that the electors should all vote upon the same day, without being
convoked to the same place. *w This double election rendered a majority
probable, though not certain; for it was possible that as many differences
might exist between the electors as between their constituents. In this case it
was necessary to have recourse to one of three measures; either to appoint new
electors, or to consult a second time those already appointed, or to defer the
election to another authority. The first two of these alternatives,
independently of the uncertainty of their results, were likely to delay the
final decision, and to perpetuate an agitation which must always be accompanied
with danger. The third expedient was therefore adopted, and it was agreed that
the votes should be transmitted sealed to the President of the Senate, and that
they should be opened and counted in the presence of the Senate and the House
of Representatives. If none of the candidates has a majority, the House of
Representatives then proceeds immediately to elect a President, but with the
condition that it must fix upon one of the three candidates who have the
highest numbers. *x
v 
[ As many as it sends members to Congress. The number of electors at the
election of 1833 was 288. (See “The National Calendar,” 1833.)]
w 
[ The electors of the same State assemble, but they transmit to the central
government the list of their individual votes, and not the mere result of the
vote of the majority.] [Footnote x: In this case it is the majority of the
States, and not the majority of the members, which decides the question; so
that New York has not more influence in the debate than Rhode Island. Thus the
citizens of the Union are first consulted as members of one and the same
community; and, if they cannot agree, recourse is had to the division of the
States, each of which has a separate and independent vote. This is one of the
singularities of the Federal Constitution which can only be explained by the
jar of conflicting interests.]
Thus it is only in case of an event which cannot often happen, and which can
never be foreseen, that the election is entrusted to the ordinary
representatives of the nation; and even then they are obliged to choose a
citizen who has already been designated by a powerful minority of the special
electors. It is by this happy expedient that the respect which is due to the
popular voice is combined with the utmost celerity of execution and those
precautions which the peace of the country demands. But the decision of the
question by the House of Representatives does not necessarily offer an
immediate solution of the difficulty, for the majority of that assembly may
still be doubtful, and in this case the Constitution prescribes no remedy.
Nevertheless, by restricting the number of candidates to three, and by
referring the matter to the judgment of an enlightened public body, it has
smoothed all the obstacles *y which are not inherent in the elective system.

[ Jefferson, in 1801, was not elected until the thirty-sixth time of
balloting.]
In the forty-four years which have elapsed since the promulgation of the
Federal Constitution the United States have twelve times chosen a President.
Ten of these elections took place simultaneously by the votes of the special
electors in the different States. The House of Representatives has only twice
exercised its conditional privilege of deciding in cases of uncertainty; the
first time was at the election of Mr. Jefferson in 1801; the second was in
1825, when Mr. Quincy Adams was named. *z

Crises Of The Election
The Election may be considered as a national crisis—Why?—Passions
of the people—Anxiety of the President—Calm which succeeds the
agitation of the election.
I have shown what the circumstances are which favored the adoption of the
elective system in the United States, and what precautions were taken by the
legislators to obviate its dangers. The Americans are habitually accustomed to
all kinds of elections, and they know by experience the utmost degree of
excitement which is compatible with security. The vast extent of the country
and the dissemination of the inhabitants render a collision between parties
less probable and less dangerous there than elsewhere. The political
circumstances under which the elections have hitherto been carried on have
presented no real embarrassments to the nation.
Nevertheless, the epoch of the election of a President of the United States may
be considered as a crisis in the affairs of the nation. The influence which he
exercises on public business is no doubt feeble and indirect; but the choice of
the President, which is of small importance to each individual citizen,
concerns the citizens collectively; and however trifling an interest may be, it
assumes a great degree of importance as soon as it becomes general. The
President possesses but few means of rewarding his supporters in comparison to
the kings of Europe, but the places which are at his disposal are sufficiently
numerous to interest, directly or indirectly, several thousand electors in his
success. Political parties in the United States are led to rally round an
individual, in order to acquire a more tangible shape in the eyes of the crowd,
and the name of the candidate for the Presidency is put forward as the symbol
and personification of their theories. For these reasons parties are strongly
interested in gaining the election, not so much with a view to the triumph of
their principles under the auspices of the President-elect as to show by the
majority which returned him, the strength of the supporters of those
principles.
For a long while before the appointed time is at hand the election becomes the
most important and the all-engrossing topic of discussion. The ardor of faction
is redoubled; and all the artificial passions which the imagination can create
in the bosom of a happy and peaceful land are agitated and brought to light.
The President, on the other hand, is absorbed by the cares of self-defence. He
no longer governs for the interest of the State, but for that of his
re-election; he does homage to the majority, and instead of checking its
passions, as his duty commands him to do, he frequently courts its worst
caprices. As the election draws near, the activity of intrigue and the
agitation of the populace increase; the citizens are divided into hostile
camps, each of which assumes the name of its favorite candidate; the whole
nation glows with feverish excitement; the election is the daily theme of the
public papers, the subject of private conversation, the end of every thought
and every action, the sole interest of the present. As soon as the choice is
determined, this ardor is dispelled; and as a calmer season returns, the
current of the State, which had nearly broken its banks, sinks to its usual
level: *a but who can refrain from astonishment at the causes of the storm.
a 
[ [Not always. The election of President Lincoln was the signal of civil
war.—Translator’s Note.]]
When the head of the executive power is re-eligible, it is the State which is
the source of intrigue and corruption—The desire of being re-elected the
chief aim of a President of the United States—Disadvantage of the system
peculiar to America—The natural evil of democracy is that it subordinates
all authority to the slightest desires of the majority—The re-election of
the President encourages this evil.
It may be asked whether the legislators of the United States did right or wrong
in allowing the re-election of the President. It seems at first sight contrary
to all reason to prevent the head of the executive power from being elected a
second time. The influence which the talents and the character of a single
individual may exercise upon the fate of a whole people, in critical
circumstances or arduous times, is well known: a law preventing the re-election
of the chief magistrate would deprive the citizens of the surest pledge of the
prosperity and the security of the commonwealth; and, by a singular
inconsistency, a man would be excluded from the government at the very time
when he had shown his ability in conducting its affairs.
But if these arguments are strong, perhaps still more powerful reasons may be
advanced against them. Intrigue and corruption are the natural defects of
elective government; but when the head of the State can be re-elected these
evils rise to a great height, and compromise the very existence of the country.
When a simple candidate seeks to rise by intrigue, his manoeuvres must
necessarily be limited to a narrow sphere; but when the chief magistrate enters
the lists, he borrows the strength of the government for his own purposes. In
the former case the feeble resources of an individual are in action; in the
latter, the State itself, with all its immense influence, is busied in the work
of corruption and cabal. The private citizen, who employs the most immoral
practices to acquire power, can only act in a manner indirectly prejudicial to
the public prosperity. But if the representative of the executive descends into
the combat, the cares of government dwindle into second-rate importance, and
the success of his election is his first concern. All laws and all the
negotiations he undertakes are to him nothing more than electioneering schemes;
places become the reward of services rendered, not to the nation, but to its
chief; and the influence of the government, if not injurious to the country, is
at least no longer beneficial to the community for which it was created.
It is impossible to consider the ordinary course of affairs in the United
States without perceiving that the desire of being re-elected is the chief aim
of the President; that his whole administration, and even his most indifferent
measures, tend to this object; and that, as the crisis approaches, his personal
interest takes the place of his interest in the public good. The principle of
re-eligibility renders the corrupt influence of elective government still more
extensive and pernicious.
In America it exercises a peculiarly fatal influence on the sources of national
existence. Every government seems to be afflicted by some evil which is
inherent in its nature, and the genius of the legislator is shown in eluding
its attacks. A State may survive the influence of a host of bad laws, and the
mischief they cause is frequently exaggerated; but a law which encourages the
growth of the canker within must prove fatal in the end, although its bad
consequences may not be immediately perceived.
The principle of destruction in absolute monarchies lies in the excessive and
unreasonable extension of the prerogative of the crown; and a measure tending
to remove the constitutional provisions which counterbalance this influence
would be radically bad, even if its immediate consequences were unattended with
evil. By a parity of reasoning, in countries governed by a democracy, where the
people is perpetually drawing all authority to itself, the laws which increase
or accelerate its action are the direct assailants of the very principle of the
government.
The greatest proof of the ability of the American legislators is, that they
clearly discerned this truth, and that they had the courage to act up to it.
They conceived that a certain authority above the body of the people was
necessary, which should enjoy a degree of independence, without, however, being
entirely beyond the popular control; an authority which would be forced to
comply with the permanent determinations of the majority, but which would be
able to resist its caprices, and to refuse its most dangerous demands. To this
end they centred the whole executive power of the nation in a single arm; they
granted extensive prerogatives to the President, and they armed him with the
veto to resist the encroachments of the legislature.
But by introducing the principle of re-election they partly destroyed their
work; and they rendered the President but little inclined to exert the great
power they had vested in his hands. If ineligible a second time, the President
would be far from independent of the people, for his responsibility would not
be lessened; but the favor of the people would not be so necessary to him as to
induce him to court it by humoring its desires. If re-eligible (and this is
more especially true at the present day, when political morality is relaxed,
and when great men are rare), the President of the United States becomes an
easy tool in the hands of the majority. He adopts its likings and its
animosities, he hastens to anticipate its wishes, he forestalls its complaints,
he yields to its idlest cravings, and instead of guiding it, as the legislature
intended that he should do, he is ever ready to follow its bidding. Thus, in
order not to deprive the State of the talents of an individual, those talents
have been rendered almost useless; and to reserve an expedient for
extraordinary perils, the country has been exposed to daily dangers.
Federal Courts *b

institutions. See also the Federal Constitution, Art. 3. See “The

Political importance of the judiciary in the United States—Difficulty of
treating this subject—Utility of judicial power in
confederations—What tribunals could be introduced into the
Union—Necessity of establishing federal courts of
justice—Organization of the national judiciary—The Supreme
Court—In what it differs from all known tribunals.
I have inquired into the legislative and executive power of the Union, and the
judicial power now remains to be examined; but in this place I cannot conceal
my fears from the reader. Their judicial institutions exercise a great
influence on the condition of the Anglo-Americans, and they occupy a prominent
place amongst what are probably called political institutions: in this respect
they are peculiarly deserving of our attention. But I am at a loss to explain
the political action of the American tribunals without entering into some
technical details of their constitution and their forms of proceeding; and I
know not how to descend to these minutiae without wearying the curiosity of the
reader by the natural aridity of the subject, or without risking to fall into
obscurity through a desire to be succinct. I can scarcely hope to escape these
various evils; for if I appear too lengthy to a man of the world, a lawyer may
on the other hand complain of my brevity. But these are the natural
disadvantages of my subject, and more especially of the point which I am about
to discuss.
The great difficulty was, not to devise the Constitution to the Federal
Government, but to find out a method of enforcing its laws. Governments have in
general but two means of overcoming the opposition of the people they govern,
viz., the physical force which is at their own disposal, and the moral force
which they derive from the decisions of the courts of justice.
A government which should have no other means of exacting obedience than open
war must be very near its ruin, for one of two alternatives would then probably
occur: if its authority was small and its character temperate, it would not
resort to violence till the last extremity, and it would connive at a number of
partial acts of insubordination, in which case the State would gradually fall
into anarchy; if it was enterprising and powerful, it would perpetually have
recourse to its physical strength, and would speedily degenerate into a
military despotism. So that its activity would not be less prejudicial to the
community than its inaction.
The great end of justice is to substitute the notion of right for that of
violence, and to place a legal barrier between the power of the government and
the use of physical force. The authority which is awarded to the intervention
of a court of justice by the general opinion of mankind is so surprisingly
great that it clings to the mere formalities of justice, and gives a bodily
influence to the shadow of the law. The moral force which courts of justice
possess renders the introduction of physical force exceedingly rare, and is
very frequently substituted for it; but if the latter proves to be
indispensable, its power is doubled by the association of the idea of law.
A federal government stands in greater need of the support of judicial
institutions than any other, because it is naturally weak and exposed to
formidable opposition. *c If it were always obliged to resort to violence in
the first instance, it could not fulfil its task. The Union, therefore,
required a national judiciary to enforce the obedience of the citizens to the
laws, and to repeal the attacks which might be directed against them. The
question then remained as to what tribunals were to exercise these privileges;
were they to be entrusted to the courts of justice which were already organized
in every State? or was it necessary to create federal courts? It may easily be
proved that the Union could not adapt the judicial power of the States to its
wants. The separation of the judiciary from the administrative power of the
State no doubt affects the security of every citizen and the liberty of all.
But it is no less important to the existence of the nation that these several
powers should have the same origin, should follow the same principles, and act
in the same sphere; in a word, that they should be correlative and homogeneous.
No one, I presume, ever suggested the advantage of trying offences committed in
France by a foreign court of justice, in order to secure the impartiality of
the judges. The Americans form one people in relation to their Federal
Government; but in the bosom of this people divers political bodies have been
allowed to subsist which are dependent on the national Government in a few
points, and independent in all the rest; which have all a distinct origin,
maxims peculiar to themselves, and special means of carrying on their affairs.
To entrust the execution of the laws of the Union to tribunals instituted by
these political bodies would be to allow foreign judges to preside over the
nation. Nay, more; not only is each State foreign to the Union at large, but it
is in perpetual opposition to the common interests, since whatever authority
the Union loses turns to the advantage of the States. Thus to enforce the laws
of the Union by means of the tribunals of the States would be to allow not only
foreign but partial judges to preside over the nation.
c 
[ Federal laws are those which most require courts of justice, and those at the
same time which have most rarely established them. The reason is that
confederations have usually been formed by independent States, which
entertained no real intention of obeying the central Government, and which very
readily ceded the right of command to the federal executive, and very prudently
reserved the right of non-compliance to themselves.]
But the number, still more than the mere character, of the tribunals of the
States rendered them unfit for the service of the nation. When the Federal
Constitution was formed there were already thirteen courts of justice in the
United States which decided causes without appeal. That number is now increased
to twenty-four. To suppose that a State can subsist when its fundamental laws
may be subjected to four-and-twenty different interpretations at the same time
is to advance a proposition alike contrary to reason and to experience.
The American legislators therefore agreed to create a federal judiciary power
to apply the laws of the Union, and to determine certain questions affecting
general interests, which were carefully determined beforehand. The entire
judicial power of the Union was centred in one tribunal, which was denominated
the Supreme Court of the United States. But, to facilitate the expedition of
business, inferior courts were appended to it, which were empowered to decide
causes of small importance without appeal, and with appeal causes of more
magnitude. The members of the Supreme Court are named neither by the people nor
the legislature, but by the President of the United States, acting with the
advice of the Senate. In order to render them independent of the other
authorities, their office was made inalienable; and it was determined that
their salary, when once fixed, should not be altered by the legislature. *d It
was easy to proclaim the principle of a Federal judiciary, but difficulties
multiplied when the extent of its jurisdiction was to be determined.
d 
[ The Union was divided into districts, in each of which a resident Federal
judge was appointed, and the court in which he presided was termed a
“District Court.” Each of the judges of the Supreme Court annually
visits a certain portion of the Republic, in order to try the most important
causes upon the spot; the court presided over by this magistrate is styled a
“Circuit Court.” Lastly, all the most serious cases of litigation
are brought before the Supreme Court, which holds a solemn session once a year,
at which all the judges of the Circuit Courts must attend. The jury was
introduced into the Federal Courts in the same manner, and in the same cases,
as into the courts of the States.
It will be observed that no analogy exists between the Supreme Court of the
United States and the French Cour de Cassation, since the latter only hears
appeals on questions of law. The Supreme Court decides upon the evidence of the
fact as well as upon the law of the case, whereas the Cour de Cassation does
not pronounce a decision of its own, but refers the cause to the arbitration of
another tribunal. See the law of September 24, 1789, “Laws of the United
States,” by Story, vol. i. p. 53.]
Means Of Determining The Jurisdiction Of The Federal Courts Difficulty of
determining the jurisdiction of separate courts of justice in
confederations—The courts of the Union obtained the right of fixing their
own jurisdiction—In what respect this rule attacks the portion of
sovereignty reserved to the several States—The sovereignty of these
States restricted by the laws, and the interpretation of the
laws—Consequently, the danger of the several States is more apparent than
real.
As the Constitution of the United States recognized two distinct powers in
presence of each other, represented in a judicial point of view by two distinct
classes of courts of justice, the utmost care which could be taken in defining
their separate jurisdictions would have been insufficient to prevent frequent
collisions between those tribunals. The question then arose to whom the right
of deciding the competency of each court was to be referred.
In nations which constitute a single body politic, when a question is debated
between two courts relating to their mutual jurisdiction, a third tribunal is
generally within reach to decide the difference; and this is effected without
difficulty, because in these nations the questions of judicial competency have
no connection with the privileges of the national supremacy. But it was
impossible to create an arbiter between a superior court of the Union and the
superior court of a separate State which would not belong to one of these two
classes. It was, therefore, necessary to allow one of these courts to judge its
own cause, and to take or to retain cognizance of the point which was
contested. To grant this privilege to the different courts of the States would
have been to destroy the sovereignty of the Union de facto after having
established it de jure; for the interpretation of the Constitution would soon
have restored that portion of independence to the States of which the terms of
that act deprived them. The object of the creation of a Federal tribunal was to
prevent the courts of the States from deciding questions affecting the national
interests in their own department, and so to form a uniform body of
jurisprudene for the interpretation of the laws of the Union. This end would
not have been accomplished if the courts of the several States had been
competent to decide upon cases in their separate capacities from which they
were obliged to abstain as Federal tribunals. The Supreme Court of the United
States was therefore invested with the right of determining all questions of
jurisdiction. *e
e 
[ In order to diminish the number of these suits, it was decided that in a
great many Federal causes the courts of the States should be empowered to
decide conjointly with those of the Union, the losing party having then a right
of appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States. The Supreme Court of
Virginia contested the right of the Supreme Court of the United States to judge
an appeal from its decisions, but unsuccessfully. See “Kent’s
Commentaries,” vol. i. p. 300, pp. 370 et seq.; Story’s
“Commentaries,” p. 646; and “The Organic Law of the United
States,” vol. i. p. 35.]
This was a severe blow upon the independence of the States, which was thus
restricted not only by the laws, but by the interpretation of them; by one
limit which was known, and by another which was dubious; by a rule which was
certain, and a rule which was arbitrary. It is true the Constitution had laid
down the precise limits of the Federal supremacy, but whenever this supremacy
is contested by one of the States, a Federal tribunal decides the question.
Nevertheless, the dangers with which the independence of the States was
threatened by this mode of proceeding are less serious than they appeared to
be. We shall see hereafter that in America the real strength of the country is
vested in the provincial far more than in the Federal Government. The Federal
judges are conscious of the relative weakness of the power in whose name they
act, and they are more inclined to abandon a right of jurisdiction in cases
where it is justly their own than to assert a privilege to which they have no
legal claim.
Different Cases Of Jurisdiction
The matter and the party are the first conditions of the Federal
jurisdiction—Suits in which ambassadors are engaged—Suits of the
Union—Of a separate State—By whom tried—Causes resulting from
the laws of the Union—Why judged by the Federal tribunals—Causes
relating to the performance of contracts tried by the Federal
courts—Consequence of this arrangement.
After having appointed the means of fixing the competency of the Federal
courts, the legislators of the Union defined the cases which should come within
their jurisdiction. It was established, on the one hand, that certain parties
must always be brought before the Federal courts, without any regard to the
special nature of the cause; and, on the other, that certain causes must always
be brought before the same courts, without any regard to the quality of the
parties in the suit. These distinctions were therefore admitted to be the basis
of the Federal jurisdiction.
Ambassadors are the representatives of nations in a state of amity with the
Union, and whatever concerns these personages concerns in some degree the whole
Union. When an ambassador is a party in a suit, that suit affects the welfare
of the nation, and a Federal tribunal is naturally called upon to decide it.
The Union itself may be invoked in legal proceedings, and in this case it would
be alike contrary to the customs of all nations and to common sense to appeal
to a tribunal representing any other sovereignty than its own; the Federal
courts, therefore, take cognizance of these affairs.
When two parties belonging to two different States are engaged in a suit, the
case cannot with propriety be brought before a court of either State. The
surest expedient is to select a tribunal like that of the Union, which can
excite the suspicions of neither party, and which offers the most natural as
well as the most certain remedy.
When the two parties are not private individuals, but States, an important
political consideration is added to the same motive of equity. The quality of
the parties in this case gives a national importance to all their disputes; and
the most trifling litigation of the States may be said to involve the peace of
the whole Union. *f
f 
[ The Constitution also says that the Federal courts shall decide
“controversies between a State and the citizens of another State.”
And here a most important question of a constitutional nature arose, which was,
whether the jurisdiction given by the Constitution in cases in which a State is
a party extended to suits brought against a State as well as by it, or was
exclusively confined to the latter. The question was most elaborately
considered in the case of Chisholm v. Georgia, and was decided by the majority
of the Supreme Court in the affirmative. The decision created general alarm
among the States, and an amendment was proposed and ratified by which the power
was entirely taken away, so far as it regards suits brought against a State.
See Story’s “Commentaries,” p. 624, or in the large edition
Section 1677.]
The nature of the cause frequently prescribes the rule of competency. Thus all
the questions which concern maritime commerce evidently fall under the
cognizance of the Federal tribunals. *g Almost all these questions are
connected with the interpretation of the law of nations, and in this respect
they essentially interest the Union in relation to foreign powers. Moreover, as
the sea is not included within the limits of any peculiar jurisdiction, the
national courts can only hear causes which originate in maritime affairs.
g 
[ As for instance, all cases of piracy.]
The Constitution comprises under one head almost all the cases which by their
very nature come within the limits of the Federal courts. The rule which it
lays down is simple, but pregnant with an entire system of ideas, and with a
vast multitude of facts. It declares that the judicial power of the Supreme
Court shall extend to all cases in law and equity arising under the laws of the
United States.
Two examples will put the intention of the legislator in the clearest light:
The Constitution prohibits the States from making laws on the value and
circulation of money: If, notwithstanding this prohibition, a State passes a
law of this kind, with which the interested parties refuse to comply because it
is contrary to the Constitution, the case must come before a Federal court,
because it arises under the laws of the United States. Again, if difficulties
arise in the levying of import duties which have been voted by Congress, the
Federal court must decide the case, because it arises under the interpretation
of a law of the United States.
This rule is in perfect accordance with the fundamental principles of the
Federal Constitution. The Union, as it was established in 1789, possesses, it
is true, a limited supremacy; but it was intended that within its limits it
should form one and the same people. *h Within those limits the Union is
sovereign. When this point is established and admitted, the inference is easy;
for if it be acknowledged that the United States constitute one and the same
people within the bounds prescribed by their Constitution, it is impossible to
refuse them the rights which belong to other nations. But it has been allowed,
from the origin of society, that every nation has the right of deciding by its
own courts those questions which concern the execution of its own laws. To this
it is answered that the Union is in so singular a position that in relation to
some matters it constitutes a people, and that in relation to all the rest it
is a nonentity. But the inference to be drawn is, that in the laws relating to
these matters the Union possesses all the rights of absolute sovereignty. The
difficulty is to know what these matters are; and when once it is resolved (and
we have shown how it was resolved, in speaking of the means of determining the
jurisdiction of the Federal courts) no further doubt can arise; for as soon as
it is established that a suit is Federal—that is to say, that it belongs
to the share of sovereignty reserved by the Constitution of the Union—the
natural consequence is that it should come within the jurisdiction of a Federal
court.
h 
[ This principle was in some measure restricted by the introduction of the
several States as independent powers into the Senate, and by allowing them to
vote separately in the House of Representatives when the President is elected
by that body. But these are exceptions, and the contrary principle is the
rule.]
Whenever the laws of the United States are attacked, or whenever they are
resorted to in self-defence, the Federal courts must be appealed to. Thus the
jurisdiction of the tribunals of the Union extends and narrows its limits
exactly in the same ratio as the sovereignty of the Union augments or
decreases. We have shown that the principal aim of the legislators of 1789 was
to divide the sovereign authority into two parts. In the one they placed the
control of all the general interests of the Union, in the other the control of
the special interests of its component States. Their chief solicitude was to
arm the Federal Government with sufficient power to enable it to resist, within
its sphere, the encroachments of the several States. As for these communities,
the principle of independence within certain limits of their own was adopted in
their behalf; and they were concealed from the inspection, and protected from
the control, of the central Government. In speaking of the division of
authority, I observed that this latter principle had not always been held
sacred, since the States are prevented from passing certain laws which
apparently belong to their own particular sphere of interest. When a State of
the Union passes a law of this kind, the citizens who are injured by its
execution can appeal to the Federal courts.
Thus the jurisdiction of the Federal courts extends not only to all the cases
which arise under the laws of the Union, but also to those which arise under
laws made by the several States in opposition to the Constitution. The States
are prohibited from making ex post facto laws in criminal cases, and any person
condemned by virtue of a law of this kind can appeal to the judicial power of
the Union. The States are likewise prohibited from making laws which may have a
tendency to impair the obligations of contracts. *i If a citizen thinks that an
obligation of this kind is impaired by a law passed in his State, he may refuse
to obey it, and may appeal to the Federal courts. *j
i 
[ It is perfectly clear, says Mr. Story (“Commentaries,” p. 503, or
in the large edition Section 1379), that any law which enlarges, abridges, or
in any manner changes the intention of the parties, resulting from the
stipulations in the contract, necessarily impairs it. He gives in the same
place a very long and careful definition of what is understood by a contract in
Federal jurisprudence. A grant made by the State to a private individual, and
accepted by him, is a contract, and cannot be revoked by any future law. A
charter granted by the State to a company is a contract, and equally binding to
the State as to the grantee. The clause of the Constitution here referred to
insures, therefore, the existence of a great part of acquired rights, but not
of all. Property may legally be held, though it may not have passed into the
possessor’s hands by means of a contract; and its possession is an
acquired right, not guaranteed by the Federal Constitution.]
j 
[ A remarkable instance of this is given by Mr. Story (p. 508, or in the large
edition Section 1388): “Dartmouth College in New Hampshire had been
founded by a charter granted to certain individuals before the American
Revolution, and its trustees formed a corporation under this charter. The
legislature of New Hampshire had, without the consent of this corporation,
passed an act changing the organization of the original provincial charter of
the college, and transferring all the rights, privileges, and franchises from
the old charter trustees to new trustees appointed under the act. The
constitutionality of the act was contested, and, after solemn arguments, it was
deliberately held by the Supreme Court that the provincial charter was a
contract within the meaning of the Constitution (Art. I. Section 10), and that
the emendatory act was utterly void, as impairing the obligation of that
charter. The college was deemed, like other colleges of private foundation, to
be a private eleemosynary institution, endowed by its charter with a capacity
to take property unconnected with the Government. Its funds were bestowed upon
the faith of the charter, and those funds consisted entirely of private
donations. It is true that the uses were in some sense public, that is, for the
general benefit, and not for the mere benefit of the corporators; but this did
not make the corporation a public corporation. It was a private institution for
general charity. It was not distinguishable in principle from a private
donation, vested in private trustees, for a public charity, or for a particular
purpose of beneficence. And the State itself, if it had bestowed funds upon a
charity of the same nature, could not resume those funds.”]
This provision appears to me to be the most serious attack upon the
independence of the States. The rights awarded to the Federal Government for
purposes of obvious national importance are definite and easily comprehensible;
but those with which this last clause invests it are not either clearly
appreciable or accurately defined. For there are vast numbers of political laws
which influence the existence of obligations of contracts, which may thus
furnish an easy pretext for the aggressions of the central authority.
Natural weakness of the judiciary power in confederations—Legislators
ought to strive as much as possible to bring private individuals, and not
States, before the Federal Courts—How the Americans have succeeded in
this—Direct prosecution of private individuals in the Federal
Courts—Indirect prosecution of the States which violate the laws of the
Union—The decrees of the Supreme Court enervate but do not destroy the
provincial laws.
I have shown what the privileges of the Federal courts are, and it is no less
important to point out the manner in which they are exercised. The irresistible
authority of justice in countries in which the sovereignty in undivided is
derived from the fact that the tribunals of those countries represent the
entire nation at issue with the individual against whom their decree is
directed, and the idea of power is thus introduced to corroborate the idea of
right. But this is not always the case in countries in which the sovereignty is
divided; in them the judicial power is more frequently opposed to a fraction of
the nation than to an isolated individual, and its moral authority and physical
strength are consequently diminished. In federal States the power of the judge
is naturally decreased, and that of the justiciable parties is augmented. The
aim of the legislator in confederate States ought therefore to be to render the
position of the courts of justice analogous to that which they occupy in
countries where the sovereignty is undivided; in other words, his efforts ought
constantly to tend to maintain the judicial power of the confederation as the
representative of the nation, and the justiciable party as the representative
of an individual interest.
Every government, whatever may be its constitution, requires the means of
constraining its subjects to discharge their obligations, and of protecting its
privileges from their assaults. As far as the direct action of the Government
on the community is concerned, the Constitution of the United States contrived,
by a master-stroke of policy, that the federal courts, acting in the name of
the laws, should only take cognizance of parties in an individual capacity.
For, as it had been declared that the Union consisted of one and the same
people within the limits laid down by the Constitution, the inference was that
the Government created by this Constitution, and acting within these limits,
was invested with all the privileges of a national government, one of the
principal of which is the right of transmitting its injunctions directly to the
private citizen. When, for instance, the Union votes an impost, it does not
apply to the States for the levying of it, but to every American citizen in
proportion to his assessment. The Supreme Court, which is empowered to enforce
the execution of this law of the Union, exerts its influence not upon a
refractory State, but upon the private taxpayer; and, like the judicial power
of other nations, it is opposed to the person of an individual. It is to be
observed that the Union chose its own antagonist; and as that antagonist is
feeble, he is naturally worsted.
But the difficulty increases when the proceedings are not brought forward by
but against the Union. The Constitution recognizes the legislative power of the
States; and a law so enacted may impair the privileges of the Union, in which
case a collision in unavoidable between that body and the State which has
passed the law: and it only remains to select the least dangerous remedy, which
is very clearly deducible from the general principles I have before
established. *k
k 
[ See Chapter VI. on “Judicial Power in America.”]
It may be conceived that, in the case under consideration, the Union might have
used the State before a Federal court, which would have annulled the act, and
by this means it would have adopted a natural course of proceeding; but the
judicial power would have been placed in open hostility to the State, and it
was desirable to avoid this predicament as much as possible. The Americans hold
that it is nearly impossible that a new law should not impair the interests of
some private individual by its provisions: these private interests are assumed
by the American legislators as the ground of attack against such measures as
may be prejudicial to the Union, and it is to these cases that the protection
of the Supreme Court is extended.
Suppose a State vends a certain portion of its territory to a company, and that
a year afterwards it passes a law by which the territory is otherwise disposed
of, and that clause of the Constitution which prohibits laws impairing the
obligation of contracts violated. When the purchaser under the second act
appears to take possession, the possessor under the first act brings his action
before the tribunals of the Union, and causes the title of the claimant to be
pronounced null and void. *l Thus, in point of fact, the judicial power of the
Union is contesting the claims of the sovereignty of a State; but it only acts
indirectly and upon a special application of detail: it attacks the law in its
consequences, not in its principle, and it rather weakens than destroys it.
l 
[ See Kent’s “Commentaries,” vol. i. p. 387.]
The last hypothesis that remained was that each State formed a corporation
enjoying a separate existence and distinct civil rights, and that it could
therefore sue or be sued before a tribunal. Thus a State could bring an action
against another State. In this instance the Union was not called upon to
contest a provincial law, but to try a suit in which a State was a party. This
suit was perfectly similar to any other cause, except that the quality of the
parties was different; and here the danger pointed out at the beginning of this
chapter exists with less chance of being avoided. The inherent disadvantage of
the very essence of Federal constitutions is that they engender parties in the
bosom of the nation which present powerful obstacles to the free course of
justice.
High Rank Of The Supreme Court Amongst The Great Powers Of State No nation ever
constituted so great a judicial power as the Americans—Extent of its
prerogative—Its political influence—The tranquillity and the very
existence of the Union depend on the discretion of the seven Federal Judges.
When we have successively examined in detail the organization of the Supreme
Court, and the entire prerogatives which it exercises, we shall readily admit
that a more imposing judicial power was never constituted by any people. The
Supreme Court is placed at the head of all known tribunals, both by the nature
of its rights and the class of justiciable parties which it controls.
In all the civilized countries of Europe the Government has always shown the
greatest repugnance to allow the cases to which it was itself a party to be
decided by the ordinary course of justice. This repugnance naturally attains
its utmost height in an absolute Government; and, on the other hand, the
privileges of the courts of justice are extended with the increasing liberties
of the people: but no European nation has at present held that all judicial
controversies, without regard to their origin, can be decided by the judges of
common law.
In America this theory has been actually put in practice, and the Supreme Court
of the United States is the sole tribunal of the nation. Its power extends to
all the cases arising under laws and treaties made by the executive and
legislative authorities, to all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction,
and in general to all points which affect the law of nations. It may even be
affirmed that, although its constitution is essentially judicial, its
prerogatives are almost entirely political. Its sole object is to enforce the
execution of the laws of the Union; and the Union only regulates the relations
of the Government with the citizens, and of the nation with Foreign Powers: the
relations of citizens amongst themselves are almost exclusively regulated by
the sovereignty of the States.
A second and still greater cause of the preponderance of this court may be
adduced. In the nations of Europe the courts of justice are only called upon to
try the controversies of private individuals; but the Supreme Court of the
United States summons sovereign powers to its bar. When the clerk of the court
advances on the steps of the tribunal, and simply says, “The State of New
York versus the State of Ohio,” it is impossible not to feel that the
Court which he addresses is no ordinary body; and when it is recollected that
one of these parties represents one million, and the other two millions of men,
one is struck by the responsibility of the seven judges whose decision is about
to satisfy or to disappoint so large a number of their fellow-citizens.
The peace, the prosperity, and the very existence of the Union are vested in
the hands of the seven judges. Without their active co-operation the
Constitution would be a dead letter: the Executive appeals to them for
assistance against the encroachments of the legislative powers; the Legislature
demands their protection from the designs of the Executive; they defend the
Union from the disobedience of the States, the States from the exaggerated
claims of the Union, the public interest against the interests of private
citizens, and the conservative spirit of order against the fleeting innovations
of democracy. Their power is enormous, but it is clothed in the authority of
public opinion. They are the all-powerful guardians of a people which respects
law, but they would be impotent against popular neglect or popular contempt.
The force of public opinion is the most intractable of agents, because its
exact limits cannot be defined; and it is not less dangerous to exceed than to
remain below the boundary prescribed.
The Federal judges must not only be good citizens, and men possessed of that
information and integrity which are indispensable to magistrates, but they must
be statesmen—politicians, not unread in the signs of the times, not
afraid to brave the obstacles which can be subdued, nor slow to turn aside such
encroaching elements as may threaten the supremacy of the Union and the
obedience which is due to the laws.
The President, who exercises a limited power, may err without causing great
mischief in the State. Congress may decide amiss without destroying the Union,
because the electoral body in which Congress originates may cause it to retract
its decision by changing its members. But if the Supreme Court is ever composed
of imprudent men or bad citizens, the Union may be plunged into anarchy or
civil war.
The real cause of this danger, however, does not lie in the constitution of the
tribunal, but in the very nature of Federal Governments. We have observed that
in confederate peoples it is especially necessary to consolidate the judicial
authority, because in no other nations do those independent persons who are
able to cope with the social body exist in greater power or in a better
condition to resist the physical strength of the Government. But the more a
power requires to be strengthened, the more extensive and independent it must
be made; and the dangers which its abuse may create are heightened by its
independence and its strength. The source of the evil is not, therefore, in the
constitution of the power, but in the constitution of those States which render
its existence necessary.
In What Respects The Federal Constitution Is Superior To That Of The States
In what respects the Constitution of the Union can be compared to that of the
States—Superiority of the Constitution of the Union attributable to the
wisdom of the Federal legislators—Legislature of the Union less dependent
on the people than that of the States—Executive power more independent in
its sphere—Judicial power less subjected to the inclinations of the
majority—Practical consequence of these facts—The dangers inherent
in a democratic government eluded by the Federal legislators, and increased by
the legislators of the States.
The Federal Constitution differs essentially from that of the States in the
ends which it is intended to accomplish, but in the means by which these ends
are promoted a greater analogy exists between them. The objects of the
Governments are different, but their forms are the same; and in this special
point of view there is some advantage in comparing them together.
I am of opinion that the Federal Constitution is superior to all the
Constitutions of the States, for several reasons.
The present Constitution of the Union was formed at a later period than those
of the majority of the States, and it may have derived some ameliorations from
past experience. But we shall be led to acknowledge that this is only a
secondary cause of its superiority, when we recollect that eleven new States *n
have been added to the American Confederation since the promulgation of the
Federal Constitution, and that these new republics have always rather
exaggerated than avoided the defects which existed in the former Constitutions.
n 
[ [The number of States has now risen to 46 (1874), besides the District of
Columbia.]]
The chief cause of the superiority of the Federal Constitution lay in the
character of the legislators who composed it. At the time when it was formed
the dangers of the Confederation were imminent, and its ruin seemed inevitable.
In this extremity the people chose the men who most deserved the esteem, rather
than those who had gained the affections, of the country. I have already
observed that distinguished as almost all the legislators of the Union were for
their intelligence, they were still more so for their patriotism. They had all
been nurtured at a time when the spirit of liberty was braced by a continual
struggle against a powerful and predominant authority. When the contest was
terminated, whilst the excited passions of the populace persisted in warring
with dangers which had ceased to threaten them, these men stopped short in
their career; they cast a calmer and more penetrating look upon the country
which was now their own; they perceived that the war of independence was
definitely ended, and that the only dangers which America had to fear were
those which might result from the abuse of the freedom she had won. They had
the courage to say what they believed to be true, because they were animated by
a warm and sincere love of liberty; and they ventured to propose restrictions,
because they were resolutely opposed to destruction. *o
o 
[ At this time Alexander Hamilton, who was one of the principal founders of the
Constitution, ventured to express the following sentiments in “The
Federalist,” No. 71:—
“There are some who would be inclined to regard the servile pliancy of
the Executive to a prevailing current, either in the community or in the
Legislature, as its best recommendation. But such men entertain very crude
notions, as well of the purposes for which government was instituted as of the
true means by which the public happiness may be promoted. The Republican
principle demands that the deliberative sense of the community should govern
the conduct of those to whom they entrust the management of their affairs; but
it does not require an unqualified complaisance to every sudden breeze of
passion, or to every transient impulse which the people may receive from the
arts of men who flatter their prejudices to betray their interests. It is a
just observation, that the people commonly intend the public good. This often
applies to their very errors. But their good sense would despise the adulator
who should pretend that they always reason right about the means of promoting
it. They know from experience that they sometimes err; and the wonder is that
they so seldom err as they do, beset, as they continually are, by the wiles of
parasites and sycophants; by the snares of the ambitious, the avaricious, the
desperate; by the artifices of men who possess their confidence more than they
deserve it, and of those who seek to possess rather than to deserve it. When
occasions present themselves in which the interests of the people are at
variance with their inclinations, it is the duty of persons whom they have
appointed to be the guardians of those interests to withstand the temporary
delusion, in order to give them time and opportunity for more cool and sedate
reflection. Instances might be cited in which a conduct of this kind has saved
the people from very fatal consequences of their own mistakes, and has procured
lasting monuments of their gratitude to the men who had courage and magnanimity
enough to serve them at the peril of their displeasure.”]
The greater number of the Constitutions of the States assign one year for the
duration of the House of Representatives, and two years for that of the Senate;
so that members of the legislative body are constantly and narrowly tied down
by the slightest desires of their constituents. The legislators of the Union
were of opinion that this excessive dependence of the Legislature tended to
alter the nature of the main consequences of the representative system, since
it vested the source, not only of authority, but of government, in the people.
They increased the length of the time for which the representatives were
returned, in order to give them freer scope for the exercise of their own
judgment.
The Federal Constitution, as well as the Constitutions of the different States,
divided the legislative body into two branches. But in the States these two
branches were composed of the same elements, and elected in the same manner.
The consequence was that the passions and inclinations of the populace were as
rapidly and as energetically represented in one chamber as in the other, and
that laws were made with all the characteristics of violence and precipitation.
By the Federal Constitution the two houses originate in like manner in the
choice of the people; but the conditions of eligibility and the mode of
election were changed, to the end that, if, as is the case in certain nations,
one branch of the Legislature represents the same interests as the other, it
may at least represent a superior degree of intelligence and discretion. A
mature age was made one of the conditions of the senatorial dignity, and the
Upper House was chosen by an elected assembly of a limited number of members.
To concentrate the whole social force in the hands of the legislative body is
the natural tendency of democracies; for as this is the power which emanates
the most directly from the people, it is made to participate most fully in the
preponderating authority of the multitude, and it is naturally led to
monopolize every species of influence. This concentration is at once
prejudicial to a well-conducted administration, and favorable to the despotism
of the majority. The legislators of the States frequently yielded to these
democratic propensities, which were invariably and courageously resisted by the
founders of the Union.
In the States the executive power is vested in the hands of a magistrate, who
is apparently placed upon a level with the Legislature, but who is in reality
nothing more than the blind agent and the passive instrument of its decisions.
He can derive no influence from the duration of his functions, which terminate
with the revolving year, or from the exercise of prerogatives which can
scarcely be said to exist. The Legislature can condemn him to inaction by
intrusting the execution of the laws to special committees of its own members,
and can annul his temporary dignity by depriving him of his salary. The Federal
Constitution vests all the privileges and all the responsibility of the
executive power in a single individual. The duration of the Presidency is fixed
at four years; the salary of the individual who fills that office cannot be
altered during the term of his functions; he is protected by a body of official
dependents, and armed with a suspensive veto. In short, every effort was made
to confer a strong and independent position upon the executive authority within
the limits which had been prescribed to it.
In the Constitutions of all the States the judicial power is that which remains
the most independent of the legislative authority; nevertheless, in all the
States the Legislature has reserved to itself the right of regulating the
emoluments of the judges, a practice which necessarily subjects these
magistrates to its immediate influence. In some States the judges are only
temporarily appointed, which deprives them of a great portion of their power
and their freedom. In others the legislative and judicial powers are entirely
confounded; thus the Senate of New York, for instance, constitutes in certain
cases the Superior Court of the State. The Federal Constitution, on the other
hand, carefully separates the judicial authority from all external influences;
and it provides for the independence of the judges, by declaring that their
salary shall not be altered, and that their functions shall be inalienable.
The practical consequences of these different systems may easily be perceived.
An attentive observer will soon remark that the business of the Union is
incomparably better conducted than that of any individual State. The conduct of
the Federal Government is more fair and more temperate than that of the States,
its designs are more fraught with wisdom, its projects are more durable and
more skilfully combined, its measures are put into execution with more vigor
and consistency.
I recapitulate the substance of this chapter in a few words: The existence of
democracies is threatened by two dangers, viz., the complete subjection of the
legislative body to the caprices of the electoral body, and the concentration
of all the powers of the Government in the legislative authority. The growth of
these evils has been encouraged by the policy of the legislators of the States,
but it has been resisted by the legislators of the Union by every means which
lay within their control.
Characteristics Which Distinguish The Federal Constitution Of The United States
Of America From All Other Federal Constitutions American Union appears to
resemble all other confederations—Nevertheless its effects are
different—Reason of this—Distinctions between the Union and all
other confederations—The American Government not a federal but an
imperfect national Government.
The United States of America do not afford either the first or the only
instance of confederate States, several of which have existed in modern Europe,
without adverting to those of antiquity. Switzerland, the Germanic Empire, and
the Republic of the United Provinces either have been or still are
confederations. In studying the constitutions of these different countries, the
politician is surprised to observe that the powers with which they invested the
Federal Government are nearly identical with the privileges awarded by the
American Constitution to the Government of the United States. They confer upon
the central power the same rights of making peace and war, of raising money and
troops, and of providing for the general exigencies and the common interests of
the nation. Nevertheless the Federal Government of these different peoples has
always been as remarkable for its weakness and inefficiency as that of the
Union is for its vigorous and enterprising spirit. Again, the first American
Confederation perished through the excessive weakness of its Government; and
this weak Government was, notwithstanding, in possession of rights even more
extensive than those of the Federal Government of the present day. But the more
recent Constitution of the United States contains certain principles which
exercise a most important influence, although they do not at once strike the
observer.
This Constitution, which may at first sight be confounded with the federal
constitutions which preceded it, rests upon a novel theory, which may be
considered as a great invention in modern political science. In all the
confederations which had been formed before the American Constitution of 1789
the allied States agreed to obey the injunctions of a Federal Government; but
they reserved to themselves the right of ordaining and enforcing the execution
of the laws of the Union. The American States which combined in 1789 agreed
that the Federal Government should not only dictate the laws, but that it
should execute it own enactments. In both cases the right is the same, but the
exercise of the right is different; and this alteration produced the most
momentous consequences.
In all the confederations which had been formed before the American Union the
Federal Government demanded its supplies at the hands of the separate
Governments; and if the measure it prescribed was onerous to any one of those
bodies means were found to evade its claims: if the State was powerful, it had
recourse to arms; if it was weak, it connived at the resistance which the law
of the Union, its sovereign, met with, and resorted to inaction under the plea
of inability. Under these circumstances one of the two alternatives has
invariably occurred; either the most preponderant of the allied peoples has
assumed the privileges of the Federal authority and ruled all the States in its
name, *p or the Federal Government has been abandoned by its natural
supporters, anarchy has arisen between the confederates, and the Union has lost
all powers of action. *q
p 
[ This was the case in Greece, when Philip undertook to execute the decree of
the Amphictyons; in the Low Countries, where the province of Holland always
gave the law; and, in our own time, in the Germanic Confederation, in which
Austria and Prussia assume a great degree of influence over the whole country,
in the name of the Diet.]
q 
[ Such has always been the situation of the Swiss Confederation, which would
have perished ages ago but for the mutual jealousies of its neighbors.]
In America the subjects of the Union are not States, but private citizens: the
national Government levies a tax, not upon the State of Massachusetts, but upon
each inhabitant of Massachusetts. All former confederate governments presided
over communities, but that of the Union rules individuals; its force is not
borrowed, but self-derived; and it is served by its own civil and military
officers, by its own army, and its own courts of justice. It cannot be doubted
that the spirit of the nation, the passions of the multitude, and the
provincial prejudices of each State tend singularly to diminish the authority
of a Federal authority thus constituted, and to facilitate the means of
resistance to its mandates; but the comparative weakness of a restricted
sovereignty is an evil inherent in the Federal system. In America, each State
has fewer opportunities of resistance and fewer temptations to non-compliance;
nor can such a design be put in execution (if indeed it be entertained) without
an open violation of the laws of the Union, a direct interruption of the
ordinary course of justice, and a bold declaration of revolt; in a word,
without taking a decisive step which men hesitate to adopt.
In all former confederations the privileges of the Union furnished more
elements of discord than of power, since they multiplied the claims of the
nation without augmenting the means of enforcing them: and in accordance with
this fact it may be remarked that the real weakness of federal governments has
almost always been in the exact ratio of their nominal power. Such is not the
case in the American Union, in which, as in ordinary governments, the Federal
Government has the means of enforcing all it is empowered to demand.
The human understanding more easily invents new things than new words, and we
are thence constrained to employ a multitude of improper and inadequate
expressions. When several nations form a permanent league and establish a
supreme authority, which, although it has not the same influence over the
members of the community as a national government, acts upon each of the
Confederate States in a body, this Government, which is so essentially
different from all others, is denominated a Federal one. Another form of
society is afterwards discovered, in which several peoples are fused into one
and the same nation with regard to certain common interests, although they
remain distinct, or at least only confederate, with regard to all their other
concerns. In this case the central power acts directly upon those whom it
governs, whom it rules, and whom it judges, in the same manner, as, but in a
more limited circle than, a national government. Here the term Federal
Government is clearly no longer applicable to a state of things which must be
styled an incomplete national Government: a form of government has been found
out which is neither exactly national nor federal; but no further progress has
been made, and the new word which will one day designate this novel invention
does not yet exist.
The absence of this new species of confederation has been the cause which has
brought all Unions to Civil War, to subjection, or to a stagnant apathy, and
the peoples which formed these leagues have been either too dull to discern, or
too pusillanimous to apply this great remedy. The American Confederation
perished by the same defects.
But the Confederate States of America had been long accustomed to form a
portion of one empire before they had won their independence; they had not
contracted the habit of governing themselves, and their national prejudices had
not taken deep root in their minds. Superior to the rest of the world in
political knowledge, and sharing that knowledge equally amongst themselves,
they were little agitated by the passions which generally oppose the extension
of federal authority in a nation, and those passions were checked by the wisdom
of the chief citizens. The Americans applied the remedy with prudent firmness
as soon as they were conscious of the evil; they amended their laws, and they
saved their country.
Advantages Of The Federal System In General, And Its Special Utility In
America.
Happiness and freedom of small nations—Power of great nations—Great
empires favorable to the growth of civilization—Strength often the first
element of national prosperity—Aim of the Federal system to unite the
twofold advantages resulting from a small and from a large
territory—Advantages derived by the United States from this
system—The law adapts itself to the exigencies of the population;
population does not conform to the exigencies of the law—Activity,
amelioration, love and enjoyment of freedom in the American
communities—Public spirit of the Union the abstract of provincial
patriotism—Principles and things circulate freely over the territory of
the United States—The Union is happy and free as a little nation, and
respected as a great empire.
In small nations the scrutiny of society penetrates into every part, and the
spirit of improvement enters into the most trifling details; as the ambition of
the people is necessarily checked by its weakness, all the efforts and
resources of the citizens are turned to the internal benefit of the community,
and are not likely to evaporate in the fleeting breath of glory. The desires of
every individual are limited, because extraordinary faculties are rarely to be
met with. The gifts of an equal fortune render the various conditions of life
uniform, and the manners of the inhabitants are orderly and simple. Thus, if
one estimate the gradations of popular morality and enlightenment, we shall
generally find that in small nations there are more persons in easy
circumstances, a more numerous population, and a more tranquil state of
society, than in great empires.
When tyranny is established in the bosom of a small nation, it is more galling
than elsewhere, because, as it acts within a narrow circle, every point of that
circle is subject to its direct influence. It supplies the place of those great
designs which it cannot entertain by a violent or an exasperating interference
in a multitude of minute details; and it leaves the political world, to which
it properly belongs, to meddle with the arrangements of domestic life. Tastes
as well as actions are to be regulated at its pleasure; and the families of the
citizens as well as the affairs of the State are to be governed by its
decisions. This invasion of rights occurs, however, but seldom, and freedom is
in truth the natural state of small communities. The temptations which the
Government offers to ambition are too weak, and the resources of private
individuals are too slender, for the sovereign power easily to fall within the
grasp of a single citizen; and should such an event have occurred, the subjects
of the State can without difficulty overthrow the tyrant and his oppression by
a simultaneous effort.
Small nations have therefore ever been the cradle of political liberty; and the
fact that many of them have lost their immunities by extending their dominion
shows that the freedom they enjoyed was more a consequence of the inferior size
than of the character of the people.
The history of the world affords no instance of a great nation retaining the
form of republican government for a long series of years, *r and this has led
to the conclusion that such a state of things is impracticable. For my own
part, I cannot but censure the imprudence of attempting to limit the possible
and to judge the future on the part of a being who is hourly deceived by the
most palpable realities of life, and who is constantly taken by surprise in the
circumstances with which he is most familiar. But it may be advanced with
confidence that the existence of a great republic will always be exposed to far
greater perils than that of a small one.
r 
[ I do not speak of a confederation of small republics, but of a great
consolidated Republic.]
All the passions which are most fatal to republican institutions spread with an
increasing territory, whilst the virtues which maintain their dignity do not
augment in the same proportion. The ambition of the citizens increases with the
power of the State; the strength of parties with the importance of the ends
they have in view; but that devotion to the common weal which is the surest
check on destructive passions is not stronger in a large than in a small
republic. It might, indeed, be proved without difficulty that it is less
powerful and less sincere. The arrogance of wealth and the dejection of
wretchedness, capital cities of unwonted extent, a lax morality, a vulgar
egotism, and a great confusion of interests, are the dangers which almost
invariably arise from the magnitude of States. But several of these evils are
scarcely prejudicial to a monarchy, and some of them contribute to maintain its
existence. In monarchical States the strength of the government is its own; it
may use, but it does not depend on, the community, and the authority of the
prince is proportioned to the prosperity of the nation; but the only security
which a republican government possesses against these evils lies in the support
of the majority. This support is not, however, proportionably greater in a
large republic than it is in a small one; and thus, whilst the means of attack
perpetually increase both in number and in influence, the power of resistance
remains the same, or it may rather be said to diminish, since the propensities
and interests of the people are diversified by the increase of the population,
and the difficulty of forming a compact majority is constantly augmented. It
has been observed, moreover, that the intensity of human passions is
heightened, not only by the importance of the end which they propose to attain,
but by the multitude of individuals who are animated by them at the same time.
Every one has had occasion to remark that his emotions in the midst of a
sympathizing crowd are far greater than those which he would have felt in
solitude. In great republics the impetus of political passion is irresistible,
not only because it aims at gigantic purposes, but because it is felt and
shared by millions of men at the same time.
It may therefore be asserted as a general proposition that nothing is more
opposed to the well-being and the freedom of man than vast empires.
Nevertheless it is important to acknowledge the peculiar advantages of great
States. For the very reason which renders the desire of power more intense in
these communities than amongst ordinary men, the love of glory is also more
prominent in the hearts of a class of citizens, who regard the applause of a
great people as a reward worthy of their exertions, and an elevating
encouragement to man. If we would learn why it is that great nations contribute
more powerfully to the spread of human improvement than small States, we shall
discover an adequate cause in the rapid and energetic circulation of ideas, and
in those great cities which are the intellectual centres where all the rays of
human genius are reflected and combined. To this it may be added that most
important discoveries demand a display of national power which the Government
of a small State is unable to make; in great nations the Government entertains
a greater number of general notions, and is more completely disengaged from the
routine of precedent and the egotism of local prejudice; its designs are
conceived with more talent, and executed with more boldness.
In time of peace the well-being of small nations is undoubtedly more general
and more complete, but they are apt to suffer more acutely from the calamities
of war than those great empires whose distant frontiers may for ages avert the
presence of the danger from the mass of the people, which is therefore more
frequently afflicted than ruined by the evil.
But in this matter, as in many others, the argument derived from the necessity
of the case predominates over all others. If none but small nations existed, I
do not doubt that mankind would be more happy and more free; but the existence
of great nations is unavoidable.
This consideration introduces the element of physical strength as a condition
of national prosperity. It profits a people but little to be affluent and free
if it is perpetually exposed to be pillaged or subjugated; the number of its
manufactures and the extent of its commerce are of small advantage if another
nation has the empire of the seas and gives the law in all the markets of the
globe. Small nations are often impoverished, not because they are small, but
because they are weak; the great empires prosper less because they are great
than because they are strong. Physical strength is therefore one of the first
conditions of the happiness and even of the existence of nations. Hence it
occurs that, unless very peculiar circumstances intervene, small nations are
always united to large empires in the end, either by force or by their own
consent: yet I am unacquainted with a more deplorable spectacle than that of a
people unable either to defend or to maintain its independence.
The Federal system was created with the intention of combining the different
advantages which result from the greater and the lesser extent of nations; and
a single glance over the United States of America suffices to discover the
advantages which they have derived from its adoption.
In great centralized nations the legislator is obliged to impart a character of
uniformity to the laws which does not always suit the diversity of customs and
of districts; as he takes no cognizance of special cases, he can only proceed
upon general principles; and the population is obliged to conform to the
exigencies of the legislation, since the legislation cannot adapt itself to the
exigencies and the customs of the population, which is the cause of endless
trouble and misery. This disadvantage does not exist in confederations.
Congress regulates the principal measures of the national Government, and all
the details of the administration are reserved to the provincial legislatures.
It is impossible to imagine how much this division of sovereignty contributes
to the well-being of each of the States which compose the Union. In these small
communities, which are never agitated by the desire of aggrandizement or the
cares of self-defence, all public authority and private energy is employed in
internal amelioration. The central government of each State, which is in
immediate juxtaposition to the citizens, is daily apprised of the wants which
arise in society; and new projects are proposed every year, which are discussed
either at town meetings or by the legislature of the State, and which are
transmitted by the press to stimulate the zeal and to excite the interest of
the citizens. This spirit of amelioration is constantly alive in the American
republics, without compromising their tranquillity; the ambition of power
yields to the less refined and less dangerous love of comfort. It is generally
believed in America that the existence and the permanence of the republican
form of government in the New World depend upon the existence and the
permanence of the Federal system; and it is not unusual to attribute a large
share of the misfortunes which have befallen the new States of South America to
the injudicious erection of great republics, instead of a divided and
confederate sovereignty.
It is incontestably true that the love and the habits of republican government
in the United States were engendered in the townships and in the provincial
assemblies. In a small State, like that of Connecticut for instance, where
cutting a canal or laying down a road is a momentous political question, where
the State has no army to pay and no wars to carry on, and where much wealth and
much honor cannot be bestowed upon the chief citizens, no form of government
can be more natural or more appropriate than that of a republic. But it is this
same republican spirit, it is these manners and customs of a free people, which
are engendered and nurtured in the different States, to be afterwards applied
to the country at large. The public spirit of the Union is, so to speak,
nothing more than an abstract of the patriotic zeal of the provinces. Every
citizen of the United States transfuses his attachment to his little republic
in the common store of American patriotism. In defending the Union he defends
the increasing prosperity of his own district, the right of conducting its
affairs, and the hope of causing measures of improvement to be adopted which
may be favorable to his own interest; and these are motives which are wont to
stir men more readily than the general interests of the country and the glory
of the nation.
On the other hand, if the temper and the manners of the inhabitants especially
fitted them to promote the welfare of a great republic, the Federal system
smoothed the obstacles which they might have encountered. The confederation of
all the American States presents none of the ordinary disadvantages resulting
from great agglomerations of men. The Union is a great republic in extent, but
the paucity of objects for which its Government provides assimilates it to a
small State. Its acts are important, but they are rare. As the sovereignty of
the Union is limited and incomplete, its exercise is not incompatible with
liberty; for it does not excite those insatiable desires of fame and power
which have proved so fatal to great republics. As there is no common centre to
the country, vast capital cities, colossal wealth, abject poverty, and sudden
revolutions are alike unknown; and political passion, instead of spreading over
the land like a torrent of desolation, spends its strength against the
interests and the individual passions of every State.
Nevertheless, all commodities and ideas circulate throughout the Union as
freely as in a country inhabited by one people. Nothing checks the spirit of
enterprise. Government avails itself of the assistance of all who have talents
or knowledge to serve it. Within the frontiers of the Union the profoundest
peace prevails, as within the heart of some great empire; abroad, it ranks with
the most powerful nations of the earth; two thousand miles of coast are open to
the commerce of the world; and as it possesses the keys of the globe, its flags
is respected in the most remote seas. The Union is as happy and as free as a
small people, and as glorious and as strong as a great nation.
Why The Federal System Is Not Adapted To All Peoples, And How The
Anglo-Americans Were Enabled To Adopt It.
Every Federal system contains defects which baffle the efforts of the
legislator—The Federal system is complex—It demands a daily
exercise of discretion on the part of the citizens—Practical knowledge of
government common amongst the Americans—Relative weakness of the
Government of the Union, another defect inherent in the Federal
system—The Americans have diminished without remedying it—The
sovereignty of the separate States apparently weaker, but really stronger, than
that of the Union—Why?—Natural causes of union must exist between
confederate peoples besides the laws—What these causes are amongst the
Anglo-Americans—Maine and Georgia, separated by a distance of a thousand
miles, more naturally united than Normandy and Brittany—War, the main
peril of confederations—This proved even by the example of the United
States—The Union has no great wars to fear—Why?—Dangers to
which Europeans would be exposed if they adopted the Federal system of the
Americans.
When a legislator succeeds, after persevering efforts, in exercising an
indirect influence upon the destiny of nations, his genius is lauded by
mankind, whilst, in point of fact, the geographical position of the country
which he is unable to change, a social condition which arose without his
co-operation, manners and opinions which he cannot trace to their source, and
an origin with which he is unacquainted, exercise so irresistible an influence
over the courses of society that he is himself borne away by the current, after
an ineffectual resistance. Like the navigator, he may direct the vessel which
bears him along, but he can neither change its structure, nor raise the winds,
nor lull the waters which swell beneath him.
I have shown the advantages which the Americans derive from their federal
system; it remains for me to point out the circumstances which rendered that
system practicable, as its benefits are not to be enjoyed by all nations. The
incidental defects of the Federal system which originate in the laws may be
corrected by the skill of the legislator, but there are further evils inherent
in the system which cannot be counteracted by the peoples which adopt it. These
nations must therefore find the strength necessary to support the natural
imperfections of their Government.
The most prominent evil of all Federal systems is the very complex nature of
the means they employ. Two sovereignties are necessarily in presence of each
other. The legislator may simplify and equalize the action of these two
sovereignties, by limiting each of them to a sphere of authority accurately
defined; but he cannot combine them into one, or prevent them from coming into
collision at certain points. The Federal system therefore rests upon a theory
which is necessarily complicated, and which demands the daily exercise of a
considerable share of discretion on the part of those it governs.
A proposition must be plain to be adopted by the understanding of a people. A
false notion which is clear and precise will always meet with a greater number
of adherents in the world than a true principle which is obscure or involved.
Hence it arises that parties, which are like small communities in the heart of
the nation, invariably adopt some principle or some name as a symbol, which
very inadequately represents the end they have in view and the means which are
at their disposal, but without which they could neither act nor subsist. The
governments which are founded upon a single principle or a single feeling which
is easily defined are perhaps not the best, but they are unquestionably the
strongest and the most durable in the world.
In examining the Constitution of the United States, which is the most perfect
federal constitution that ever existed, one is startled, on the other hand, at
the variety of information and the excellence of discretion which it
presupposes in the people whom it is meant to govern. The government of the
Union depends entirely upon legal fictions; the Union is an ideal nation which
only exists in the mind, and whose limits and extent can only be discerned by
the understanding.
When once the general theory is comprehended, numberless difficulties remain to
be solved in its application; for the sovereignty of the Union is so involved
in that of the States that it is impossible to distinguish its boundaries at
the first glance. The whole structure of the Government is artificial and
conventional; and it would be ill adapted to a people which has not been long
accustomed to conduct its own affairs, or to one in which the science of
politics has not descended to the humblest classes of society. I have never
been more struck by the good sense and the practical judgment of the Americans
than in the ingenious devices by which they elude the numberless difficulties
resulting from their Federal Constitution. I scarcely ever met with a plain
American citizen who could not distinguish, with surprising facility, the
obligations created by the laws of Congress from those created by the laws of
his own State; and who, after having discriminated between the matters which
come under the cognizance of the Union and those which the local legislature is
competent to regulate, could not point out the exact limit of the several
jurisdictions of the Federal courts and the tribunals of the State.
The Constitution of the United States is like those exquisite productions of
human industry which ensure wealth and renown to their inventors, but which are
profitless in any other hands. This truth is exemplified by the condition of
Mexico at the present time. The Mexicans were desirous of establishing a
federal system, and they took the Federal Constitution of their neighbors, the
Anglo-Americans, as their model, and copied it with considerable accuracy. *s
But although they had borrowed the letter of the law, they were unable to
create or to introduce the spirit and the sense which give it life. They were
involved in ceaseless embarrassments between the mechanism of their double
government; the sovereignty of the States and that of the Union perpetually
exceeded their respective privileges, and entered into collision; and to the
present day Mexico is alternately the victim of anarchy and the slave of
military despotism.
s 
[ See the Mexican Constitution of 1824.]
The second and the most fatal of all the defects I have alluded to, and that
which I believe to be inherent in the federal system, is the relative weakness
of the government of the Union. The principle upon which all confederations
rest is that of a divided sovereignty. The legislator may render this partition
less perceptible, he may even conceal it for a time from the public eye, but he
cannot prevent it from existing, and a divided sovereignty must always be less
powerful than an entire supremacy. The reader has seen in the remarks I have
made on the Constitution of the United States that the Americans have displayed
singular ingenuity in combining the restriction of the power of the Union
within the narrow limits of a federal government with the semblance and, to a
certain extent, with the force of a national government. By this means the
legislators of the Union have succeeded in diminishing, though not in
counteracting the natural danger of confederations.
It has been remarked that the American Government does not apply itself to the
States, but that it immediately transmits its injunctions to the citizens, and
compels them as isolated individuals to comply with its demands. But if the
Federal law were to clash with the interests and the prejudices of a State, it
might be feared that all the citizens of that State would conceive themselves
to be interested in the cause of a single individual who should refuse to obey.
If all the citizens of the State were aggrieved at the same time and in the
same manner by the authority of the Union, the Federal Government would vainly
attempt to subdue them individually; they would instinctively unite in a common
defence, and they would derive a ready-prepared organization from the share of
sovereignty which the institution of their State allows them to enjoy. Fiction
would give way to reality, and an organized portion of the territory might then
contest the central authority. *t The same observation holds good with regard
to the Federal jurisdiction. If the courts of the Union violated an important
law of a State in a private case, the real, if not the apparent, contest would
arise between the aggrieved State represented by a citizen and the Union
represented by its courts of justice. *u
t 
[ [This is precisely what occurred in 1862, and the following paragraph
describes correctly the feelings and notions of the South. General Lee held
that his primary allegiance was due, not to the Union, but to Virginia.]]
u 
[ For instance, the Union possesses by the Constitution the right of selling
unoccupied lands for its own profit. Supposing that the State of Ohio should
claim the same right in behalf of certain territories lying within its
boundaries, upon the plea that the Constitution refers to those lands alone
which do not belong to the jurisdiction of any particular State, and
consequently should choose to dispose of them itself, the litigation would be
carried on in the names of the purchasers from the State of Ohio and the
purchasers from the Union, and not in the names of Ohio and the Union. But what
would become of this legal fiction if the Federal purchaser was confirmed in
his right by the courts of the Union, whilst the other competitor was ordered
to retain possession by the tribunals of the State of Ohio?]
He would have but a partial knowledge of the world who should imagine that it
is possible, by the aid of legal fictions, to prevent men from finding out and
employing those means of gratifying their passions which have been left open to
them; and it may be doubted whether the American legislators, when they
rendered a collision between the two sovereigns less probable, destroyed the
cause of such a misfortune. But it may even be affirmed that they were unable
to ensure the preponderance of the Federal element in a case of this kind. The
Union is possessed of money and of troops, but the affections and the
prejudices of the people are in the bosom of the States. The sovereignty of the
Union is an abstract being, which is connected with but few external objects;
the sovereignty of the States is hourly perceptible, easily understood,
constantly active; and if the former is of recent creation, the latter is
coeval with the people itself. The sovereignty of the Union is factitious, that
of the States is natural, and derives its existence from its own simple
influence, like the authority of a parent. The supreme power of the nation only
affects a few of the chief interests of society; it represents an immense but
remote country, and claims a feeling of patriotism which is vague and ill
defined; but the authority of the States controls every individual citizen at
every hour and in all circumstances; it protects his property, his freedom, and
his life; and when we recollect the traditions, the customs, the prejudices of
local and familiar attachment with which it is connected, we cannot doubt of
the superiority of a power which is interwoven with every circumstance that
renders the love of one’s native country instinctive in the human heart.
Since legislators are unable to obviate such dangerous collisions as occur
between the two sovereignties which coexist in the federal system, their first
object must be, not only to dissuade the confederate States from warfare, but
to encourage such institutions as may promote the maintenance of peace. Hence
it results that the Federal compact cannot be lasting unless there exists in
the communities which are leagued together a certain number of inducements to
union which render their common dependence agreeable, and the task of the
Government light, and that system cannot succeed without the presence of
favorable circumstances added to the influence of good laws. All the peoples
which have ever formed a confederation have been held together by a certain
number of common interests, which served as the intellectual ties of
association.
But the sentiments and the principles of man must be taken into consideration
as well as his immediate interests. A certain uniformity of civilization is not
less necessary to the durability of a confederation than a uniformity of
interests in the States which compose it. In Switzerland the difference which
exists between the Canton of Uri and the Canton of Vaud is equal to that
between the fifteenth and the nineteenth centuries; and, properly speaking,
Switzerland has never possessed a federal government. The union between these
two cantons only subsists upon the map, and their discrepancies would soon be
perceived if an attempt were made by a central authority to prescribe the same
laws to the whole territory.
One of the circumstances which most powerfully contribute to support the
Federal Government in America is that the States have not only similar
interests, a common origin, and a common tongue, but that they are also arrived
at the same stage of civilization; which almost always renders a union
feasible. I do not know of any European nation, how small soever it may be,
which does not present less uniformity in its different provinces than the
American people, which occupies a territory as extensive as one-half of Europe.
The distance from the State of Maine to that of Georgia is reckoned at about
one thousand miles; but the difference between the civilization of Maine and
that of Georgia is slighter than the difference between the habits of Normandy
and those of Brittany. Maine and Georgia, which are placed at the opposite
extremities of a great empire, are consequently in the natural possession of
more real inducements to form a confederation than Normandy and Brittany, which
are only separated by a bridge.
The geographical position of the country contributed to increase the facilities
which the American legislators derived from the manners and customs of the
inhabitants; and it is to this circumstance that the adoption and the
maintenance of the Federal system are mainly attributable.
The most important occurrence which can mark the annals of a people is the
breaking out of a war. In war a people struggles with the energy of a single
man against foreign nations in the defence of its very existence. The skill of
a government, the good sense of the community, and the natural fondness which
men entertain for their country, may suffice to maintain peace in the interior
of a district, and to favor its internal prosperity; but a nation can only
carry on a great war at the cost of more numerous and more painful sacrifices;
and to suppose that a great number of men will of their own accord comply with
these exigencies of the State is to betray an ignorance of mankind. All the
peoples which have been obliged to sustain a long and serious warfare have
consequently been led to augment the power of their government. Those which
have not succeeded in this attempt have been subjugated. A long war almost
always places nations in the wretched alternative of being abandoned to ruin by
defeat or to despotism by success. War therefore renders the symptoms of the
weakness of a government most palpable and most alarming; and I have shown that
the inherent defeat of federal governments is that of being weak.
The Federal system is not only deficient in every kind of centralized
administration, but the central government itself is imperfectly organized,
which is invariably an influential cause of inferiority when the nation is
opposed to other countries which are themselves governed by a single authority.
In the Federal Constitution of the United States, by which the central
government possesses more real force, this evil is still extremely sensible. An
example will illustrate the case to the reader.
The Constitution confers upon Congress the right of calling forth militia to
execute the laws of the Union, suppress insurrections, and repel invasions; and
another article declares that the President of the United States is the
commander-in-chief of the militia. In the war of 1812 the President ordered the
militia of the Northern States to march to the frontiers; but Connecticut and
Massachusetts, whose interests were impaired by the war, refused to obey the
command. They argued that the Constitution authorizes the Federal Government to
call forth the militia in case of insurrection or invasion, but that in the
present instance there was neither invasion nor insurrection. They added, that
the same Constitution which conferred upon the Union the right of calling forth
the militia reserved to the States that of naming the officers; and that
consequently (as they understood the clause) no officer of the Union had any
right to command the militia, even during war, except the President in person;
and in this case they were ordered to join an army commanded by another
individual. These absurd and pernicious doctrines received the sanction not
only of the governors and the legislative bodies, but also of the courts of
justice in both States; and the Federal Government was constrained to raise
elsewhere the troops which it required. *v
v 
[ Kent’s “Commentaries,” vol. i. p. 244. I have selected an
example which relates to a time posterior to the promulgation of the present
Constitution. If I had gone back to the days of the Confederation, I might have
given still more striking instances. The whole nation was at that time in a
state of enthusiastic excitement; the Revolution was represented by a man who
was the idol of the people; but at that very period Congress had, to say the
truth, no resources at all at its disposal. Troops and supplies were
perpetually wanting. The best-devised projects failed in the execution, and the
Union, which was constantly on the verge of destruction, was saved by the
weakness of its enemies far more than by its own strength. [All doubt as to the
powers of the Federal Executive was, however, removed by its efforts in the
Civil War, and those powers were largely extended.]]
The only safeguard which the American Union, with all the relative perfection
of its laws, possesses against the dissolution which would be produced by a
great war, lies in its probable exemption from that calamity. Placed in the
centre of an immense continent, which offers a boundless field for human
industry, the Union is almost as much insulated from the world as if its
frontiers were girt by the ocean. Canada contains only a million of
inhabitants, and its population is divided into two inimical nations. The rigor
of the climate limits the extension of its territory, and shuts up its ports
during the six months of winter. From Canada to the Gulf of Mexico a few savage
tribes are to be met with, which retire, perishing in their retreat, before six
thousand soldiers. To the South, the Union has a point of contact with the
empire of Mexico; and it is thence that serious hostilities may one day be
expected to arise. But for a long while to come the uncivilized state of the
Mexican community, the depravity of its morals, and its extreme poverty, will
prevent that country from ranking high amongst nations. *w As for the Powers of
Europe, they are too distant to be formidable.
w 
[ [War broke out between the United States and Mexico in 1846, and ended in the
conquest of an immense territory, including California.]]
The great advantage of the United States does not, then, consist in a Federal
Constitution which allows them to carry on great wars, but in a geographical
position which renders such enterprises extremely improbable.
No one can be more inclined than I am myself to appreciate the advantages of
the federal system, which I hold to be one of the combinations most favorable
to the prosperity and freedom of man. I envy the lot of those nations which
have been enabled to adopt it; but I cannot believe that any confederate
peoples could maintain a long or an equal contest with a nation of similar
strength in which the government should be centralized. A people which should
divide its sovereignty into fractional powers, in the presence of the great
military monarchies of Europe, would, in my opinion, by that very act, abdicate
its power, and perhaps its existence and its name. But such is the admirable
position of the New World that man has no other enemy than himself; and that,
in order to be happy and to be free, it suffices to seek the gifts of
prosperity and the knowledge of freedom.
States
I have hitherto examined the institutions of the United States; I have passed
their legislation in review, and I have depicted the present characteristics of
political society in that country. But a sovereign power exists above these
institutions and beyond these characteristic features which may destroy or
modify them at its pleasure—I mean that of the people. It remains to be
shown in what manner this power, which regulates the laws, acts: its
propensities and its passions remain to be pointed out, as well as the secret
springs which retard, accelerate, or direct its irresistible course; and the
effects of its unbounded authority, with the destiny which is probably reserved
for it.
In America the people appoints the legislative and the executive power, and
furnishes the jurors who punish all offences against the laws. The American
institutions are democratic, not only in their principle but in all their
consequences; and the people elects its representatives directly, and for the
most part annually, in order to ensure their dependence. The people is
therefore the real directing power; and although the form of government is
representative, it is evident that the opinions, the prejudices, the interests,
and even the passions of the community are hindered by no durable obstacles
from exercising a perpetual influence on society. In the United States the
majority governs in the name of the people, as is the case in all the countries
in which the people is supreme. The majority is principally composed of
peaceful citizens who, either by inclination or by interest, are sincerely
desirous of the welfare of their country. But they are surrounded by the
incessant agitation of parties, which attempt to gain their co-operation and to
avail themselves of their support.
Great distinction to be made between parties—Parties which are to each
other as rival nations—Parties properly so called—Difference
between great and small parties—Epochs which produce them—Their
characteristics—America has had great parties—They are
extinct—Federalists—Republicans—Defeat of the
Federalists—Difficulty of creating parties in the United
States—What is done with this intention—Aristocratic or democratic
character to be met with in all parties—Struggle of General Jackson
against the Bank.
A great distinction must be made between parties. Some countries are so large
that the different populations which inhabit them have contradictory interests,
although they are the subjects of the same Government, and they may thence be
in a perpetual state of opposition. In this case the different fractions of the
people may more properly be considered as distinct nations than as mere
parties; and if a civil war breaks out, the struggle is carried on by rival
peoples rather than by factions in the State.
But when the citizens entertain different opinions upon subjects which affect
the whole country alike, such, for instance, as the principles upon which the
government is to be conducted, then distinctions arise which may correctly be
styled parties. Parties are a necessary evil in free governments; but they have
not at all times the same character and the same propensities.
At certain periods a nation may be oppressed by such insupportable evils as to
conceive the design of effecting a total change in its political constitution;
at other times the mischief lies still deeper, and the existence of society
itself is endangered. Such are the times of great revolutions and of great
parties. But between these epochs of misery and of confusion there are periods
during which human society seems to rest, and mankind to make a pause. This
pause is, indeed, only apparent, for time does not stop its course for nations
any more than for men; they are all advancing towards a goal with which they
are unacquainted; and we only imagine them to be stationary when their progress
escapes our observation, as men who are going at a foot-pace seem to be
standing still to those who run.
But however this may be, there are certain epochs at which the changes that
take place in the social and political constitution of nations are so slow and
so insensible that men imagine their present condition to be a final state; and
the human mind, believing itself to be firmly based upon certain foundations,
does not extend its researches beyond the horizon which it descries. These are
the times of small parties and of intrigue.
The political parties which I style great are those which cling to principles
more than to their consequences; to general, and not to especial cases; to
ideas, and not to men. These parties are usually distinguished by a nobler
character, by more generous passions, more genuine convictions, and a more bold
and open conduct than the others. In them private interest, which always plays
the chief part in political passions, is more studiously veiled under the
pretext of the public good; and it may even be sometimes concealed from the
eyes of the very persons whom it excites and impels.
Minor parties are, on the other hand, generally deficient in political faith.
As they are not sustained or dignified by a lofty purpose, they ostensibly
display the egotism of their character in their actions. They glow with a
factitious zeal; their language is vehement, but their conduct is timid and
irresolute. The means they employ are as wretched as the end at which they aim.
Hence it arises that when a calm state of things succeeds a violent revolution,
the leaders of society seem suddenly to disappear, and the powers of the human
mind to lie concealed. Society is convulsed by great parties, by minor ones it
is agitated; it is torn by the former, by the latter it is degraded; and if
these sometimes save it by a salutary perturbation, those invariably disturb it
to no good end.
America has already lost the great parties which once divided the nation; and
if her happiness is considerably increased, her morality has suffered by their
extinction. When the War of Independence was terminated, and the foundations of
the new Government were to be laid down, the nation was divided between two
opinions—two opinions which are as old as the world, and which are
perpetually to be met with under all the forms and all the names which have
ever obtained in free communities—the one tending to limit, the other to
extend indefinitely, the power of the people. The conflict of these two
opinions never assumed that degree of violence in America which it has
frequently displayed elsewhere. Both parties of the Americans were, in fact,
agreed upon the most essential points; and neither of them had to destroy a
traditionary constitution, or to overthrow the structure of society, in order
to ensure its own triumph. In neither of them, consequently, were a great
number of private interests affected by success or by defeat; but moral
principles of a high order, such as the love of equality and of independence,
were concerned in the struggle, and they sufficed to kindle violent passions.
The party which desired to limit the power of the people endeavored to apply
its doctrines more especially to the Constitution of the Union, whence it
derived its name of Federal. The other party, which affected to be more
exclusively attached to the cause of liberty, took that of Republican. America
is a land of democracy, and the Federalists were always in a minority; but they
reckoned on their side almost all the great men who had been called forth by
the War of Independence, and their moral influence was very considerable. Their
cause was, moreover, favored by circumstances. The ruin of the Confederation
had impressed the people with a dread of anarchy, and the Federalists did not
fail to profit by this transient disposition of the multitude. For ten or
twelve years they were at the head of affairs, and they were able to apply
some, though not all, of their principles; for the hostile current was becoming
from day to day too violent to be checked or stemmed. In 1801 the Republicans
got possession of the Government; Thomas Jefferson was named President; and he
increased the influence of their party by the weight of his celebrity, the
greatness of his talents, and the immense extent of his popularity.
The means by which the Federalists had maintained their position were
artificial, and their resources were temporary; it was by the virtues or the
talents of their leaders that they had risen to power. When the Republicans
attained to that lofty station, their opponents were overwhelmed by utter
defeat. An immense majority declared itself against the retiring party, and the
Federalists found themselves in so small a minority that they at once despaired
of their future success. From that moment the Republican or Democratic party *a
has proceeded from conquest to conquest, until it has acquired absolute
supremacy in the country. The Federalists, perceiving that they were vanquished
without resource, and isolated in the midst of the nation, fell into two
divisions, of which one joined the victorious Republicans, and the other
abandoned its rallying-point and its name. Many years have already elapsed
since they ceased to exist as a party.
a 
[ [It is scarcely necessary to remark that in more recent times the
signification of these terms has changed. The Republicans are the
representatives of the old Federalists, and the Democrats of the old
Republicans.—Trans. Note (1861).]] The accession of the Federalists to
power was, in my opinion, one of the most fortunate incidents which accompanied
the formation of the great American Union; they resisted the inevitable
propensities of their age and of the country. But whether their theories were
good or bad, they had the effect of being inapplicable, as a system, to the
society which they professed to govern, and that which occurred under the
auspices of Jefferson must therefore have taken place sooner or later. But
their Government gave the new republic time to acquire a certain stability, and
afterwards to support the rapid growth of the very doctrines which they had
combated. A considerable number of their principles were in point of fact
embodied in the political creed of their opponents; and the Federal
Constitution which subsists at the present day is a lasting monument of their
patriotism and their wisdom.
Great political parties are not, then, to be met with in the United States at
the present time. Parties, indeed, may be found which threaten the future
tranquillity of the Union; but there are none which seem to contest the present
form of Government or the present course of society. The parties by which the
Union is menaced do not rest upon abstract principles, but upon temporal
interests. These interests, disseminated in the provinces of so vast an empire,
may be said to constitute rival nations rather than parties. Thus, upon a
recent occasion, the North contended for the system of commercial prohibition,
and the South took up arms in favor of free trade, simply because the North is
a manufacturing and the South an agricultural district; and that the
restrictive system which was profitable to the one was prejudicial to the
other. *b
b 
[ [The divisions of North and South have since acquired a far greater degree of
intensity, and the South, though conquered, still presents a formidable spirit
of opposition to Northern government.—Translator’s Note, 1875.]]
In the absence of great parties, the United States abound with lesser
controversies; and public opinion is divided into a thousand minute shades of
difference upon questions of very little moment. The pains which are taken to
create parties are inconceivable, and at the present day it is no easy task. In
the United States there is no religious animosity, because all religion is
respected, and no sect is predominant; there is no jealousy of rank, because
the people is everything, and none can contest its authority; lastly, there is
no public indigence to supply the means of agitation, because the physical
position of the country opens so wide a field to industry that man is able to
accomplish the most surprising undertakings with his own native resources.
Nevertheless, ambitious men are interested in the creation of parties, since it
is difficult to eject a person from authority upon the mere ground that his
place is coveted by others. The skill of the actors in the political world lies
therefore in the art of creating parties. A political aspirant in the United
States begins by discriminating his own interest, and by calculating upon those
interests which may be collected around and amalgamated with it; he then
contrives to discover some doctrine or some principle which may suit the
purposes of this new association, and which he adopts in order to bring forward
his party and to secure his popularity; just as the imprimatur of a King was in
former days incorporated with the volume which it authorized, but to which it
nowise belonged. When these preliminaries are terminated, the new party is
ushered into the political world.
All the domestic controversies of the Americans at first appear to a stranger
to be so incomprehensible and so puerile that he is at a loss whether to pity a
people which takes such arrant trifles in good earnest, or to envy the
happiness which enables it to discuss them. But when he comes to study the
secret propensities which govern the factions of America, he easily perceives
that the greater part of them are more or less connected with one or the other
of those two divisions which have always existed in free communities. The
deeper we penetrate into the working of these parties, the more do we perceive
that the object of the one is to limit, and that of the other to extend, the
popular authority. I do not assert that the ostensible end, or even that the
secret aim, of American parties is to promote the rule of aristocracy or
democracy in the country; but I affirm that aristocratic or democratic passions
may easily be detected at the bottom of all parties, and that, although they
escape a superficial observation, they are the main point and the very soul of
every faction in the United States.
To quote a recent example. When the President attacked the Bank, the country
was excited and parties were formed; the well-informed classes rallied round
the Bank, the common people round the President. But it must not be imagined
that the people had formed a rational opinion upon a question which offers so
many difficulties to the most experienced statesmen. The Bank is a great
establishment which enjoys an independent existence, and the people, accustomed
to make and unmake whatsoever it pleases, is startled to meet with this
obstacle to its authority. In the midst of the perpetual fluctuation of society
the community is irritated by so permanent an institution, and is led to attack
it in order to see whether it can be shaken and controlled, like all the other
institutions of the country.
Remains Of The Aristocratic Party In The United States
Secret opposition of wealthy individuals to democracy—Their
retirement—Their taste for exclusive pleasures and for luxury at
home—Their simplicity abroad—Their affected condescension towards
the people.
It sometimes happens in a people amongst which various opinions prevail that
the balance of the several parties is lost, and one of them obtains an
irresistible preponderance, overpowers all obstacles, harasses its opponents,
and appropriates all the resources of society to its own purposes. The
vanquished citizens despair of success and they conceal their dissatisfaction
in silence and in general apathy. The nation seems to be governed by a single
principle, and the prevailing party assumes the credit of having restored peace
and unanimity to the country. But this apparent unanimity is merely a cloak to
alarming dissensions and perpetual opposition.
This is precisely what occurred in America; when the democratic party got the
upper hand, it took exclusive possession of the conduct of affairs, and from
that time the laws and the customs of society have been adapted to its
caprices. At the present day the more affluent classes of society are so
entirely removed from the direction of political affairs in the United States
that wealth, far from conferring a right to the exercise of power, is rather an
obstacle than a means of attaining to it. The wealthy members of the community
abandon the lists, through unwillingness to contend, and frequently to contend
in vain, against the poorest classes of their fellow citizens. They concentrate
all their enjoyments in the privacy of their homes, where they occupy a rank
which cannot be assumed in public; and they constitute a private society in the
State, which has its own tastes and its own pleasures. They submit to this
state of things as an irremediable evil, but they are careful not to show that
they are galled by its continuance; it is even not uncommon to hear them laud
the delights of a republican government, and the advantages of democratic
institutions when they are in public. Next to hating their enemies, men are
most inclined to flatter them.
Mark, for instance, that opulent citizen, who is as anxious as a Jew of the
Middle Ages to conceal his wealth. His dress is plain, his demeanor unassuming;
but the interior of his dwelling glitters with luxury, and none but a few
chosen guests whom he haughtily styles his equals are allowed to penetrate into
this sanctuary. No European noble is more exclusive in his pleasures, or more
jealous of the smallest advantages which his privileged station confers upon
him. But the very same individual crosses the city to reach a dark
counting-house in the centre of traffic, where every one may accost him who
pleases. If he meets his cobbler upon the way, they stop and converse; the two
citizens discuss the affairs of the State in which they have an equal interest,
and they shake hands before they part.
But beneath this artificial enthusiasm, and these obsequious attentions to the
preponderating power, it is easy to perceive that the wealthy members of the
community entertain a hearty distaste to the democratic institutions of their
country. The populace is at once the object of their scorn and of their fears.
If the maladministration of the democracy ever brings about a revolutionary
crisis, and if monarchical institutions ever become practicable in the United
States, the truth of what I advance will become obvious.
The two chief weapons which parties use in order to ensure success are the
public press and the formation of associations.

Liberty Of The Press In The United States
The influence of the liberty of the press does not affect political opinions
alone, but it extends to all the opinions of men, and it modifies customs as
well as laws. In another part of this work I shall attempt to determinate the
degree of influence which the liberty of the press has exercised upon civil
society in the United States, and to point out the direction which it has given
to the ideas, as well as the tone which it has imparted to the character and
the feelings, of the Anglo-Americans, but at present I purpose simply to
examine the effects produced by the liberty of the press in the political
world.
I confess that I do not entertain that firm and complete attachment to the
liberty of the press which things that are supremely good in their very nature
are wont to excite in the mind; and I approve of it more from a recollection of
the evils it prevents than from a consideration of the advantages it ensures.
If any one could point out an intermediate and yet a tenable position between
the complete independence and the entire subjection of the public expression of
opinion, I should perhaps be inclined to adopt it; but the difficulty is to
discover this position. If it is your intention to correct the abuses of
unlicensed printing and to restore the use of orderly language, you may in the
first instance try the offender by a jury; but if the jury acquits him, the
opinion which was that of a single individual becomes the opinion of the
country at large. Too much and too little has therefore hitherto been done. If
you proceed, you must bring the delinquent before a court of permanent judges.
But even here the cause must be heard before it can be decided; and the very
principles which no book would have ventured to avow are blazoned forth in the
pleadings, and what was obscurely hinted at in a single composition is then
repeated in a multitude of other publications. The language in which a thought
is embodied is the mere carcass of the thought, and not the idea itself;
tribunals may condemn the form, but the sense and spirit of the work is too
subtle for their authority. Too much has still been done to recede, too little
to attain your end; you must therefore proceed. If you establish a censorship
of the press, the tongue of the public speaker will still make itself heard,
and you have only increased the mischief. The powers of thought do not rely,
like the powers of physical strength, upon the number of their mechanical
agents, nor can a host of authors be reckoned like the troops which compose an
army; on the contrary, the authority of a principle is often increased by the
smallness of the number of men by whom it is expressed. The words of a
strong-minded man, which penetrate amidst the passions of a listening assembly,
have more power than the vociferations of a thousand orators; and if it be
allowed to speak freely in any public place, the consequence is the same as if
free speaking was allowed in every village. The liberty of discourse must
therefore be destroyed as well as the liberty of the press; this is the
necessary term of your efforts; but if your object was to repress the abuses of
liberty, they have brought you to the feet of a despot. You have been led from
the extreme of independence to the extreme of subjection without meeting with a
single tenable position for shelter or repose.
There are certain nations which have peculiar reasons for cherishing the
liberty of the press, independently of the general motives which I have just
pointed out. For in certain countries which profess to enjoy the privileges of
freedom every individual agent of the Government may violate the laws with
impunity, since those whom he oppresses cannot prosecute him before the courts
of justice. In this case the liberty of the press is not merely a guarantee,
but it is the only guarantee, of their liberty and their security which the
citizens possess. If the rulers of these nations propose to abolish the
independence of the press, the people would be justified in saying: Give us the
right of prosecuting your offences before the ordinary tribunals, and perhaps
we may then waive our right of appeal to the tribunal of public opinion.
But in the countries in which the doctrine of the sovereignty of the people
ostensibly prevails, the censorship of the press is not only dangerous, but it
is absurd. When the right of every citizen to co-operate in the government of
society is acknowledged, every citizen must be presumed to possess the power of
discriminating between the different opinions of his contemporaries, and of
appreciating the different facts from which inferences may be drawn. The
sovereignty of the people and the liberty of the press may therefore be looked
upon as correlative institutions; just as the censorship of the press and
universal suffrage are two things which are irreconcilably opposed, and which
cannot long be retained among the institutions of the same people. Not a single
individual of the twelve millions who inhabit the territory of the United
States has as yet dared to propose any restrictions to the liberty of the
press. The first newspaper over which I cast my eyes, upon my arrival in
America, contained the following article:
In all this affair the language of Jackson has been that of a heartless despot,
solely occupied with the preservation of his own authority. Ambition is his
crime, and it will be his punishment too: intrigue is his native element, and
intrigue will confound his tricks, and will deprive him of his power: he
governs by means of corruption, and his immoral practices will redound to his
shame and confusion. His conduct in the political arena has been that of a
shameless and lawless gamester. He succeeded at the time, but the hour of
retribution approaches, and he will be obliged to disgorge his winnings, to
throw aside his false dice, and to end his days in some retirement, where he
may curse his madness at his leisure; for repentance is a virtue with which his
heart is likely to remain forever unacquainted.
It is not uncommonly imagined in France that the virulence of the press
originates in the uncertain social condition, in the political excitement, and
the general sense of consequent evil which prevail in that country; and it is
therefore supposed that as soon as society has resumed a certain degree of
composure the press will abandon its present vehemence. I am inclined to think
that the above causes explain the reason of the extraordinary ascendency it has
acquired over the nation, but that they do not exercise much influence upon the
tone of its language. The periodical press appears to me to be actuated by
passions and propensities independent of the circumstances in which it is
placed, and the present position of America corroborates this opinion.
America is perhaps, at this moment, the country of the whole world which
contains the fewest germs of revolution; but the press is not less destructive
in its principles than in France, and it displays the same violence without the
same reasons for indignation. In America, as in France, it constitutes a
singular power, so strangely composed of mingled good and evil that it is at
the same time indispensable to the existence of freedom, and nearly
incompatible with the maintenance of public order. Its power is certainly much
greater in France than in the United States; though nothing is more rare in the
latter country than to hear of a prosecution having been instituted against it.
The reason of this is perfectly simple: the Americans, having once admitted the
doctrine of the sovereignty of the people, apply it with perfect consistency.
It was never their intention to found a permanent state of things with elements
which undergo daily modifications; and there is consequently nothing criminal
in an attack upon the existing laws, provided it be not attended with a violent
infraction of them. They are moreover of opinion that courts of justice are
unable to check the abuses of the press; and that as the subtilty of human
language perpetually eludes the severity of judicial analysis, offences of this
nature are apt to escape the hand which attempts to apprehend them. They hold
that to act with efficacy upon the press it would be necessary to find a
tribunal, not only devoted to the existing order of things, but capable of
surmounting the influence of public opinion; a tribunal which should conduct
its proceedings without publicity, which should pronounce its decrees without
assigning its motives, and punish the intentions even more than the language of
an author. Whosoever should have the power of creating and maintaining a
tribunal of this kind would waste his time in prosecuting the liberty of the
press; for he would be the supreme master of the whole community, and he would
be as free to rid himself of the authors as of their writings. In this
question, therefore, there is no medium between servitude and extreme license;
in order to enjoy the inestimable benefits which the liberty of the press
ensures, it is necessary to submit to the inevitable evils which it engenders.
To expect to acquire the former and to escape the latter is to cherish one of
those illusions which commonly mislead nations in their times of sickness,
when, tired with faction and exhausted by effort, they attempt to combine
hostile opinions and contrary principles upon the same soil.
The small influence of the American journals is attributable to several
reasons, amongst which are the following:
The liberty of writing, like all other liberty, is most formidable when it is a
novelty; for a people which has never been accustomed to co-operate in the
conduct of State affairs places implicit confidence in the first tribune who
arouses its attention. The Anglo-Americans have enjoyed this liberty ever since
the foundation of the settlements; moreover, the press cannot create human
passions by its own power, however skillfully it may kindle them where they
exist. In America politics are discussed with animation and a varied activity,
but they rarely touch those deep passions which are excited whenever the
positive interest of a part of the community is impaired: but in the United
States the interests of the community are in a most prosperous condition. A
single glance upon a French and an American newspaper is sufficient to show the
difference which exists between the two nations on this head. In France the
space allotted to commercial advertisements is very limited, and the
intelligence is not considerable, but the most essential part of the journal is
that which contains the discussion of the politics of the day. In America
three-quarters of the enormous sheet which is set before the reader are filled
with advertisements, and the remainder is frequently occupied by political
intelligence or trivial anecdotes: it is only from time to time that one finds
a corner devoted to passionate discussions like those with which the
journalists of France are wont to indulge their readers.
It has been demonstrated by observation, and discovered by the innate sagacity
of the pettiest as well as the greatest of despots, that the influence of a
power is increased in proportion as its direction is rendered more central. In
France the press combines a twofold centralization; almost all its power is
centred in the same spot, and vested in the same hands, for its organs are far
from numerous. The influence of a public press thus constituted, upon a
sceptical nation, must be unbounded. It is an enemy with which a Government may
sign an occasional truce, but which it is difficult to resist for any length of
time.
Neither of these kinds of centralization exists in America. The United States
have no metropolis; the intelligence as well as the power of the country are
dispersed abroad, and instead of radiating from a point, they cross each other
in every direction; the Americans have established no central control over the
expression of opinion, any more than over the conduct of business. These are
circumstances which do not depend on human foresight; but it is owing to the
laws of the Union that there are no licenses to be granted to printers, no
securities demanded from editors as in France, and no stamp duty as in France
and formerly in England. The consequence of this is that nothing is easier than
to set up a newspaper, and a small number of readers suffices to defray the
expenses of the editor.
The number of periodical and occasional publications which appears in the
United States actually surpasses belief. The most enlightened Americans
attribute the subordinate influence of the press to this excessive
dissemination; and it is adopted as an axiom of political science in that
country that the only way to neutralize the effect of public journals is to
multiply them indefinitely. I cannot conceive that a truth which is so
self-evident should not already have been more generally admitted in Europe; it
is comprehensible that the persons who hope to bring about revolutions by means
of the press should be desirous of confining its action to a few powerful
organs, but it is perfectly incredible that the partisans of the existing state
of things, and the natural supporters of the law, should attempt to diminish
the influence of the press by concentrating its authority. The Governments of
Europe seem to treat the press with the courtesy of the knights of old; they
are anxious to furnish it with the same central power which they have found to
be so trusty a weapon, in order to enhance the glory of their resistance to its
attacks.
In America there is scarcely a hamlet which has not its own newspaper. It may
readily be imagined that neither discipline nor unity of design can be
communicated to so multifarious a host, and each one is consequently led to
fight under his own standard. All the political journals of the United States
are indeed arrayed on the side of the administration or against it; but they
attack and defend in a thousand different ways. They cannot succeed in forming
those great currents of opinion which overwhelm the most solid obstacles. This
division of the influence of the press produces a variety of other consequences
which are scarcely less remarkable. The facility with which journals can be
established induces a multitude of individuals to take a part in them; but as
the extent of competition precludes the possibility of considerable profit, the
most distinguished classes of society are rarely led to engage in these
undertakings. But such is the number of the public prints that, even if they
were a source of wealth, writers of ability could not be found to direct them
all. The journalists of the United States are usually placed in a very humble
position, with a scanty education and a vulgar turn of mind. The will of the
majority is the most general of laws, and it establishes certain habits which
form the characteristics of each peculiar class of society; thus it dictates
the etiquette practised at courts and the etiquette of the bar. The
characteristics of the French journalist consist in a violent, but frequently
an eloquent and lofty, manner of discussing the politics of the day; and the
exceptions to this habitual practice are only occasional. The characteristics
of the American journalist consist in an open and coarse appeal to the passions
of the populace; and he habitually abandons the principles of political science
to assail the characters of individuals, to track them into private life, and
disclose all their weaknesses and errors.
Nothing can be more deplorable than this abuse of the powers of thought; I
shall have occasion to point out hereafter the influence of the newspapers upon
the taste and the morality of the American people, but my present subject
exclusively concerns the political world. It cannot be denied that the effects
of this extreme license of the press tend indirectly to the maintenance of
public order. The individuals who are already in the possession of a high
station in the esteem of their fellow-citizens are afraid to write in the
newspapers, and they are thus deprived of the most powerful instrument which
they can use to excite the passions of the multitude to their own advantage. *a
a 
[ They only write in the papers when they choose to address the people in their
own name; as, for instance, when they are called upon to repel calumnious
imputations, and to correct a misstatement of facts.]
The personal opinions of the editors have no kind of weight in the eyes of the
public: the only use of a journal is, that it imparts the knowledge of certain
facts, and it is only by altering or distorting those facts that a journalist
can contribute to the support of his own views.
But although the press is limited to these resources, its influence in America
is immense. It is the power which impels the circulation of political life
through all the districts of that vast territory. Its eye is constantly open to
detect the secret springs of political designs, and to summon the leaders of
all parties to the bar of public opinion. It rallies the interests of the
community round certain principles, and it draws up the creed which factions
adopt; for it affords a means of intercourse between parties which hear, and
which address each other without ever having been in immediate contact. When a
great number of the organs of the press adopt the same line of conduct, their
influence becomes irresistible; and public opinion, when it is perpetually
assailed from the same side, eventually yields to the attack. In the United
States each separate journal exercises but little authority, but the power of
the periodical press is only second to that of the people. *b
b 
[ See Appendix, P.]
The opinions established in the United States under the empire of the liberty
of the press are frequently more firmly rooted than those which are formed
elsewhere under the sanction of a censor.
In the United States the democracy perpetually raises fresh individuals to the
conduct of public affairs; and the measures of the administration are
consequently seldom regulated by the strict rules of consistency or of order.
But the general principles of the Government are more stable, and the opinions
most prevalent in society are generally more durable than in many other
countries. When once the Americans have taken up an idea, whether it be well or
ill founded, nothing is more difficult than to eradicate it from their minds.
The same tenacity of opinion has been observed in England, where, for the last
century, greater freedom of conscience and more invincible prejudices have
existed than in all the other countries of Europe. I attribute this consequence
to a cause which may at first sight appear to have a very opposite tendency,
namely, to the liberty of the press. The nations amongst which this liberty
exists are as apt to cling to their opinions from pride as from conviction.
They cherish them because they hold them to be just, and because they exercised
their own free-will in choosing them; and they maintain them not only because
they are true, but because they are their own. Several other reasons conduce to
the same end.
It was remarked by a man of genius that “ignorance lies at the two ends
of knowledge.” Perhaps it would have been more correct to have said, that
absolute convictions are to be met with at the two extremities, and that doubt
lies in the middle; for the human intellect may be considered in three distinct
states, which frequently succeed one another. A man believes implicitly,
because he adopts a proposition without inquiry. He doubts as soon as he is
assailed by the objections which his inquiries may have aroused. But he
frequently succeeds in satisfying these doubts, and then he begins to believe
afresh: he no longer lays hold on a truth in its most shadowy and uncertain
form, but he sees it clearly before him, and he advances onwards by the light
it gives him. *c
c 
[ It may, however, be doubted whether this rational and self-guiding conviction
arouses as much fervor or enthusiastic devotedness in men as their first
dogmatical belief.]
When the liberty of the press acts upon men who are in the first of these three
states, it does not immediately disturb their habit of believing implicitly
without investigation, but it constantly modifies the objects of their
intuitive convictions. The human mind continues to discern but one point upon
the whole intellectual horizon, and that point is in continual motion. Such are
the symptoms of sudden revolutions, and of the misfortunes which are sure to
befall those generations which abruptly adopt the unconditional freedom of the
press.
The circle of novel ideas is, however, soon terminated; the touch of experience
is upon them, and the doubt and mistrust which their uncertainty produces
become universal. We may rest assured that the majority of mankind will either
believe they know not wherefore, or will not know what to believe. Few are the
beings who can ever hope to attain to that state of rational and independent
conviction which true knowledge can beget in defiance of the attacks of doubt.
It has been remarked that in times of great religious fervor men sometimes
change their religious opinions; whereas in times of general scepticism
everyone clings to his own persuasion. The same thing takes place in politics
under the liberty of the press. In countries where all the theories of social
science have been contested in their turn, the citizens who have adopted one of
them stick to it, not so much because they are assured of its excellence, as
because they are not convinced of the superiority of any other. In the present
age men are not very ready to die in defence of their opinions, but they are
rarely inclined to change them; and there are fewer martyrs as well as fewer
apostates.
Another still more valid reason may yet be adduced: when no abstract opinions
are looked upon as certain, men cling to the mere propensities and external
interests of their position, which are naturally more tangible and more
permanent than any opinions in the world.
It is not a question of easy solution whether aristocracy or democracy is most
fit to govern a country. But it is certain that democracy annoys one part of
the community, and that aristocracy oppresses another part. When the question
is reduced to the simple expression of the struggle between poverty and wealth,
the tendency of each side of the dispute becomes perfectly evident without
further controversy.

associations in a democratic people.
Political Associations In The United States
In no country in the world has the principle of association been more
successfully used, or more unsparingly applied to a multitude of different
objects, than in America. Besides the permanent associations which are
established by law under the names of townships, cities, and counties, a vast
number of others are formed and maintained by the agency of private
individuals.
The citizen of the United States is taught from his earliest infancy to rely
upon his own exertions in order to resist the evils and the difficulties of
life; he looks upon social authority with an eye of mistrust and anxiety, and
he only claims its assistance when he is quite unable to shift without it. This
habit may even be traced in the schools of the rising generation, where the
children in their games are wont to submit to rules which they have themselves
established, and to punish misdemeanors which they have themselves defined. The
same spirit pervades every act of social life. If a stoppage occurs in a
thoroughfare, and the circulation of the public is hindered, the neighbors
immediately constitute a deliberative body; and this extemporaneous assembly
gives rise to an executive power which remedies the inconvenience before
anybody has thought of recurring to an authority superior to that of the
persons immediately concerned. If the public pleasures are concerned, an
association is formed to provide for the splendor and the regularity of the
entertainment. Societies are formed to resist enemies which are exclusively of
a moral nature, and to diminish the vice of intemperance: in the United States
associations are established to promote public order, commerce, industry,
morality, and religion; for there is no end which the human will, seconded by
the collective exertions of individuals, despairs of attaining.
I shall hereafter have occasion to show the effects of association upon the
course of society, and I must confine myself for the present to the political
world. When once the right of association is recognized, the citizens may
employ it in several different ways.
An association consists simply in the public assent which a number of
individuals give to certain doctrines, and in the engagement which they
contract to promote the spread of those doctrines by their exertions. The right
of association with these views is very analogous to the liberty of unlicensed
writing; but societies thus formed possess more authority than the press. When
an opinion is represented by a society, it necessarily assumes a more exact and
explicit form. It numbers its partisans, and compromises their welfare in its
cause: they, on the other hand, become acquainted with each other, and their
zeal is increased by their number. An association unites the efforts of minds
which have a tendency to diverge in one single channel, and urges them
vigorously towards one single end which it points out.
The second degree in the right of association is the power of meeting. When an
association is allowed to establish centres of action at certain important
points in the country, its activity is increased and its influence extended.
Men have the opportunity of seeing each other; means of execution are more
readily combined, and opinions are maintained with a degree of warmth and
energy which written language cannot approach.
Lastly, in the exercise of the right of political association, there is a third
degree: the partisans of an opinion may unite in electoral bodies, and choose
delegates to represent them in a central assembly. This is, properly speaking,
the application of the representative system to a party.
Thus, in the first instance, a society is formed between individuals professing
the same opinion, and the tie which keeps it together is of a purely
intellectual nature; in the second case, small assemblies are formed which only
represent a fraction of the party. Lastly, in the third case, they constitute a
separate nation in the midst of the nation, a government within the Government.
Their delegates, like the real delegates of the majority, represent the entire
collective force of their party; and they enjoy a certain degree of that
national dignity and great influence which belong to the chosen representatives
of the people. It is true that they have not the right of making the laws, but
they have the power of attacking those which are in being, and of drawing up
beforehand those which they may afterwards cause to be adopted.
If, in a people which is imperfectly accustomed to the exercise of freedom, or
which is exposed to violent political passions, a deliberating minority, which
confines itself to the contemplation of future laws, be placed in juxtaposition
to the legislative majority, I cannot but believe that public tranquillity
incurs very great risks in that nation. There is doubtless a very wide
difference between proving that one law is in itself better than another and
proving that the former ought to be substituted for the latter. But the
imagination of the populace is very apt to overlook this difference, which is
so apparent to the minds of thinking men. It sometimes happens that a nation is
divided into two nearly equal parties, each of which affects to represent the
majority. If, in immediate contiguity to the directing power, another power be
established, which exercises almost as much moral authority as the former, it
is not to be believed that it will long be content to speak without acting; or
that it will always be restrained by the abstract consideration of the nature
of associations which are meant to direct but not to enforce opinions, to
suggest but not to make the laws.
The more we consider the independence of the press in its principal
consequences, the more are we convinced that it is the chief and, so to speak,
the constitutive element of freedom in the modern world. A nation which is
determined to remain free is therefore right in demanding the unrestrained
exercise of this independence. But the unrestrained liberty of political
association cannot be entirely assimilated to the liberty of the press. The one
is at the same time less necessary and more dangerous than the other. A nation
may confine it within certain limits without forfeiting any part of its
self-control; and it may sometimes be obliged to do so in order to maintain its
own authority.
In America the liberty of association for political purposes is unbounded. An
example will show in the clearest light to what an extent this privilege is
tolerated.
The question of the tariff, or of free trade, produced a great manifestation of
party feeling in America; the tariff was not only a subject of debate as a
matter of opinion, but it exercised a favorable or a prejudicial influence upon
several very powerful interests of the States. The North attributed a great
portion of its prosperity, and the South all its sufferings, to this system;
insomuch that for a long time the tariff was the sole source of the political
animosities which agitated the Union.
In 1831, when the dispute was raging with the utmost virulence, a private
citizen of Massachusetts proposed to all the enemies of the tariff, by means of
the public prints, to send delegates to Philadelphia in order to consult
together upon the means which were most fitted to promote freedom of trade.
This proposal circulated in a few days from Maine to New Orleans by the power
of the printing-press: the opponents of the tariff adopted it with enthusiasm;
meetings were formed on all sides, and delegates were named. The majority of
these individuals were well known, and some of them had earned a considerable
degree of celebrity. South Carolina alone, which afterwards took up arms in the
same cause, sent sixty-three delegates. On October 1, 1831, this assembly,
which according to the American custom had taken the name of a Convention, met
at Philadelphia; it consisted of more than two hundred members. Its debates
were public, and they at once assumed a legislative character; the extent of
the powers of Congress, the theories of free trade, and the different clauses
of the tariff, were discussed in turn. At the end of ten days’
deliberation the Convention broke up, after having published an address to the
American people, in which it declared:
I. That Congress had not the right of making a tariff, and that the existing
tariff was unconstitutional;
II. That the prohibition of free trade was prejudicial to the interests of all
nations, and to that of the American people in particular.
It must be acknowledged that the unrestrained liberty of political association
has not hitherto produced, in the United States, those fatal consequences which
might perhaps be expected from it elsewhere. The right of association was
imported from England, and it has always existed in America; so that the
exercise of this privilege is now amalgamated with the manners and customs of
the people. At the present time the liberty of association is become a
necessary guarantee against the tyranny of the majority. In the United States,
as soon as a party is become preponderant, all public authority passes under
its control; its private supporters occupy all the places, and have all the
force of the administration at their disposal. As the most distinguished
partisans of the other side of the question are unable to surmount the
obstacles which exclude them from power, they require some means of
establishing themselves upon their own basis, and of opposing the moral
authority of the minority to the physical power which domineers over it. Thus a
dangerous expedient is used to obviate a still more formidable danger.
The omnipotence of the majority appears to me to present such extreme perils to
the American Republics that the dangerous measure which is used to repress it
seems to be more advantageous than prejudicial. And here I am about to advance
a proposition which may remind the reader of what I said before in speaking of
municipal freedom: There are no countries in which associations are more
needed, to prevent the despotism of faction or the arbitrary power of a prince,
than those which are democratically constituted. In aristocratic nations the
body of the nobles and the more opulent part of the community are in themselves
natural associations, which act as checks upon the abuses of power. In
countries in which these associations do not exist, if private individuals are
unable to create an artificial and a temporary substitute for them, I can
imagine no permanent protection against the most galling tyranny; and a great
people may be oppressed by a small faction, or by a single individual, with
impunity.
The meeting of a great political Convention (for there are Conventions of all
kinds), which may frequently become a necessary measure, is always a serious
occurrence, even in America, and one which is never looked forward to, by the
judicious friends of the country, without alarm. This was very perceptible in
the Convention of 1831, at which the exertions of all the most distinguished
members of the Assembly tended to moderate its language, and to restrain the
subjects which it treated within certain limits. It is probable, in fact, that
the Convention of 1831 exercised a very great influence upon the minds of the
malcontents, and prepared them for the open revolt against the commercial laws
of the Union which took place in 1832.
It cannot be denied that the unrestrained liberty of association for political
purposes is the privilege which a people is longest in learning how to
exercise. If it does not throw the nation into anarchy, it perpetually augments
the chances of that calamity. On one point, however, this perilous liberty
offers a security against dangers of another kind; in countries where
associations are free, secret societies are unknown. In America there are
numerous factions, but no conspiracies.
Different ways in which the right of association is understood in Europe and in
the United States—Different use which is made of it.
The most natural privilege of man, next to the right of acting for himself, is
that of combining his exertions with those of his fellow-creatures, and of
acting in common with them. I am therefore led to conclude that the right of
association is almost as inalienable as the right of personal liberty. No
legislator can attack it without impairing the very foundations of society.
Nevertheless, if the liberty of association is a fruitful source of advantages
and prosperity to some nations, it may be perverted or carried to excess by
others, and the element of life may be changed into an element of destruction.
A comparison of the different methods which associations pursue in those
countries in which they are managed with discretion, as well as in those where
liberty degenerates into license, may perhaps be thought useful both to
governments and to parties.
The greater part of Europeans look upon an association as a weapon which is to
be hastily fashioned, and immediately tried in the conflict. A society is
formed for discussion, but the idea of impending action prevails in the minds
of those who constitute it: it is, in fact, an army; and the time given to
parley serves to reckon up the strength and to animate the courage of the host,
after which they direct their march against the enemy. Resources which lie
within the bounds of the law may suggest themselves to the persons who compose
it as means, but never as the only means, of success.
Such, however, is not the manner in which the right of association is
understood in the United States. In America the citizens who form the minority
associate, in order, in the first place, to show their numerical strength, and
so to diminish the moral authority of the majority; and, in the second place,
to stimulate competition, and to discover those arguments which are most fitted
to act upon the majority; for they always entertain hopes of drawing over their
opponents to their own side, and of afterwards disposing of the supreme power
in their name. Political associations in the United States are therefore
peaceable in their intentions, and strictly legal in the means which they
employ; and they assert with perfect truth that they only aim at success by
lawful expedients.
The difference which exists between the Americans and ourselves depends on
several causes. In Europe there are numerous parties so diametrically opposed
to the majority that they can never hope to acquire its support, and at the
same time they think that they are sufficiently strong in themselves to
struggle and to defend their cause. When a party of this kind forms an
association, its object is, not to conquer, but to fight. In America the
individuals who hold opinions very much opposed to those of the majority are no
sort of impediment to its power, and all other parties hope to win it over to
their own principles in the end. The exercise of the right of association
becomes dangerous in proportion to the impossibility which excludes great
parties from acquiring the majority. In a country like the United States, in
which the differences of opinion are mere differences of hue, the right of
association may remain unrestrained without evil consequences. The inexperience
of many of the European nations in the enjoyment of liberty leads them only to
look upon the liberty of association as a right of attacking the Government.
The first notion which presents itself to a party, as well as to an individual,
when it has acquired a consciousness of its own strength, is that of violence:
the notion of persuasion arises at a later period and is only derived from
experience. The English, who are divided into parties which differ most
essentially from each other, rarely abuse the right of association, because
they have long been accustomed to exercise it. In France the passion for war is
so intense that there is no undertaking so mad, or so injurious to the welfare
of the State, that a man does not consider himself honored in defending it, at
the risk of his life.
But perhaps the most powerful of the causes which tend to mitigate the excesses
of political association in the United States is Universal Suffrage. In
countries in which universal suffrage exists the majority is never doubtful,
because neither party can pretend to represent that portion of the community
which has not voted. The associations which are formed are aware, as well as
the nation at large, that they do not represent the majority: this is, indeed,
a condition inseparable from their existence; for if they did represent the
preponderating power, they would change the law instead of soliciting its
reform. The consequence of this is that the moral influence of the Government
which they attack is very much increased, and their own power is very much
enfeebled.
In Europe there are few associations which do not affect to represent the
majority, or which do not believe that they represent it. This conviction or
this pretension tends to augment their force amazingly, and contributes no less
to legalize their measures. Violence may seem to be excusable in defence of the
cause of oppressed right. Thus it is, in the vast labyrinth of human laws, that
extreme liberty sometimes corrects the abuses of license, and that extreme
democracy obviates the dangers of democratic government. In Europe,
associations consider themselves, in some degree, as the legislative and
executive councils of the people, which is unable to speak for itself. In
America, where they only represent a minority of the nation, they argue and
they petition.
The means which the associations of Europe employ are in accordance with the
end which they propose to obtain. As the principal aim of these bodies is to
act, and not to debate, to fight rather than to persuade, they are naturally
led to adopt a form of organization which differs from the ordinary customs of
civil bodies, and which assumes the habits and the maxims of military life.
They centralize the direction of their resources as much as possible, and they
intrust the power of the whole party to a very small number of leaders.
The members of these associations respond to a watchword, like soldiers on
duty; they profess the doctrine of passive obedience; say rather, that in
uniting together they at once abjure the exercise of their own judgment and
free will; and the tyrannical control which these societies exercise is often
far more insupportable than the authority possessed over society by the
Government which they attack. Their moral force is much diminished by these
excesses, and they lose the powerful interest which is always excited by a
struggle between oppressors and the oppressed. The man who in given cases
consents to obey his fellows with servility, and who submits his activity and
even his opinions to their control, can have no claim to rank as a free
citizen.
The Americans have also established certain forms of government which are
applied to their associations, but these are invariably borrowed from the forms
of the civil administration. The independence of each individual is formally
recognized; the tendency of the members of the association points, as it does
in the body of the community, towards the same end, but they are not obliged to
follow the same track. No one abjures the exercise of his reason and his free
will; but every one exerts that reason and that will for the benefit of a
common undertaking.
I am well aware of the difficulties which attend this part of my subject, but
although every expression which I am about to make use of may clash, upon some
one point, with the feelings of the different parties which divide my country,
I shall speak my opinion with the most perfect openness.
In Europe we are at a loss how to judge the true character and the more
permanent propensities of democracy, because in Europe two conflicting
principles exist, and we do not know what to attribute to the principles
themselves, and what to refer to the passions which they bring into collision.
Such, however, is not the case in America; there the people reigns without any
obstacle, and it has no perils to dread and no injuries to avenge. In America,
democracy is swayed by its own free propensities; its course is natural and its
activity is unrestrained; the United States consequently afford the most
favorable opportunity of studying its real character. And to no people can this
inquiry be more vitally interesting than to the French nation, which is blindly
driven onwards by a daily and irresistible impulse towards a state of things
which may prove either despotic or republican, but which will assuredly be
democratic.
Universal Suffrage
I have already observed that universal suffrage has been adopted in all the
States of the Union; it consequently occurs amongst different populations which
occupy very different positions in the scale of society. I have had
opportunities of observing its effects in different localities, and amongst
races of men who are nearly strangers to each other by their language, their
religion, and their manner of life; in Louisiana as well as in New England, in
Georgia and in Canada. I have remarked that Universal Suffrage is far from
producing in America either all the good or all the evil consequences which are
assigned to it in Europe, and that its effects differ very widely from those
which are usually attributed to it.
Choice Of The People, And Instinctive Preferences Of The American Democracy
In the United States the most able men are rarely placed at the head of
affairs—Reason of this peculiarity—The envy which prevails in the
lower orders of France against the higher classes is not a French, but a purely
democratic sentiment—For what reason the most distinguished men in
America frequently seclude themselves from public affairs.
Many people in Europe are apt to believe without saying it, or to say without
believing it, that one of the great advantages of universal suffrage is, that
it entrusts the direction of public affairs to men who are worthy of the public
confidence. They admit that the people is unable to govern for itself, but they
aver that it is always sincerely disposed to promote the welfare of the State,
and that it instinctively designates those persons who are animated by the same
good wishes, and who are the most fit to wield the supreme authority. I confess
that the observations I made in America by no means coincide with these
opinions. On my arrival in the United States I was surprised to find so much
distinguished talent among the subjects, and so little among the heads of the
Government. It is a well-authenticated fact, that at the present day the most
able men in the United States are very rarely placed at the head of affairs;
and it must be acknowledged that such has been the result in proportion as
democracy has outstepped all its former limits. The race of American statesmen
has evidently dwindled most remarkably in the course of the last fifty years.
Several causes may be assigned to this phenomenon. It is impossible,
notwithstanding the most strenuous exertions, to raise the intelligence of the
people above a certain level. Whatever may be the facilities of acquiring
information, whatever may be the profusion of easy methods and of cheap
science, the human mind can never be instructed and educated without devoting a
considerable space of time to those objects.
The greater or the lesser possibility of subsisting without labor is therefore
the necessary boundary of intellectual improvement. This boundary is more
remote in some countries and more restricted in others; but it must exist
somewhere as long as the people is constrained to work in order to procure the
means of physical subsistence, that is to say, as long as it retains its
popular character. It is therefore quite as difficult to imagine a State in
which all the citizens should be very well informed as a State in which they
should all be wealthy; these two difficulties may be looked upon as
correlative. It may very readily be admitted that the mass of the citizens are
sincerely disposed to promote the welfare of their country; nay more, it may
even be allowed that the lower classes are less apt to be swayed by
considerations of personal interest than the higher orders: but it is always
more or less impossible for them to discern the best means of attaining the end
which they desire with sincerity. Long and patient observation, joined to a
multitude of different notions, is required to form a just estimate of the
character of a single individual; and can it be supposed that the vulgar have
the power of succeeding in an inquiry which misleads the penetration of genius
itself? The people has neither the time nor the means which are essential to
the prosecution of an investigation of this kind: its conclusions are hastily
formed from a superficial inspection of the more prominent features of a
question. Hence it often assents to the clamor of a mountebank who knows the
secret of stimulating its tastes, while its truest friends frequently fail in
their exertions.
Moreover, the democracy is not only deficient in that soundness of judgment
which is necessary to select men really deserving of its confidence, but it has
neither the desire nor the inclination to find them out. It cannot be denied
that democratic institutions have a very strong tendency to promote the feeling
of envy in the human heart; not so much because they afford to every one the
means of rising to the level of any of his fellow-citizens, as because those
means perpetually disappoint the persons who employ them. Democratic
institutions awaken and foster a passion for equality which they can never
entirely satisfy. This complete equality eludes the grasp of the people at the
very moment at which it thinks to hold it fast, and “flies,” as
Pascal says, “with eternal flight”; the people is excited in the
pursuit of an advantage, which is more precious because it is not sufficiently
remote to be unknown, or sufficiently near to be enjoyed. The lower orders are
agitated by the chance of success, they are irritated by its uncertainty; and
they pass from the enthusiasm of pursuit to the exhaustion of ill-success, and
lastly to the acrimony of disappointment. Whatever transcends their own limits
appears to be an obstacle to their desires, and there is no kind of
superiority, however legitimate it may be, which is not irksome in their sight.
It has been supposed that the secret instinct which leads the lower orders to
remove their superiors as much as possible from the direction of public affairs
is peculiar to France. This, however, is an error; the propensity to which I
allude is not inherent in any particular nation, but in democratic institutions
in general; and although it may have been heightened by peculiar political
circumstances, it owes its origin to a higher cause.
In the United States the people is not disposed to hate the superior classes of
society; but it is not very favorably inclined towards them, and it carefully
excludes them from the exercise of authority. It does not entertain any dread
of distinguished talents, but it is rarely captivated by them; and it awards
its approbation very sparingly to such as have risen without the popular
support.
Whilst the natural propensities of democracy induce the people to reject the
most distinguished citizens as its rulers, these individuals are no less apt to
retire from a political career in which it is almost impossible to retain their
independence, or to advance without degrading themselves. This opinion has been
very candidly set forth by Chancellor Kent, who says, in speaking with great
eulogiums of that part of the Constitution which empowers the Executive to
nominate the judges: “It is indeed probable that the men who are best
fitted to discharge the duties of this high office would have too much reserve
in their manners, and too much austerity in their principles, for them to be
returned by the majority at an election where universal suffrage is
adopted.” Such were the opinions which were printed without contradiction
in America in the year 1830!
I hold it to be sufficiently demonstrated that universal suffrage is by no
means a guarantee of the wisdom of the popular choice, and that, whatever its
advantages may be, this is not one of them.
Causes Which May Partly Correct These Tendencies Of The Democracy Contrary
effects produced on peoples as well as on individuals by great
dangers—Why so many distinguished men stood at the head of affairs in
America fifty years ago—Influence which the intelligence and the manners
of the people exercise upon its choice—Example of New
England—States of the Southwest—Influence of certain laws upon the
choice of the people—Election by an elected body—Its effects upon
the composition of the Senate.
When a State is threatened by serious dangers, the people frequently succeeds
in selecting the citizens who are the most able to save it. It has been
observed that man rarely retains his customary level in presence of very
critical circumstances; he rises above or he sinks below his usual condition,
and the same thing occurs in nations at large. Extreme perils sometimes quench
the energy of a people instead of stimulating it; they excite without directing
its passions, and instead of clearing they confuse its powers of perception.
The Jews deluged the smoking ruins of their temple with the carnage of the
remnant of their host. But it is more common, both in the case of nations and
in that of individuals, to find extraordinary virtues arising from the very
imminence of the danger. Great characters are then thrown into relief, as
edifices which are concealed by the gloom of night are illuminated by the glare
of a conflagration. At those dangerous times genius no longer abstains from
presenting itself in the arena; and the people, alarmed by the perils of its
situation, buries its envious passions in a short oblivion. Great names may
then be drawn from the balloting-box.
I have already observed that the American statesmen of the present day are very
inferior to those who stood at the head of affairs fifty years ago. This is as
much a consequence of the circumstances as of the laws of the country. When
America was struggling in the high cause of independence to throw off the yoke
of another country, and when it was about to usher a new nation into the world,
the spirits of its inhabitants were roused to the height which their great
efforts required. In this general excitement the most distinguished men were
ready to forestall the wants of the community, and the people clung to them for
support, and placed them at its head. But events of this magnitude are rare,
and it is from an inspection of the ordinary course of affairs that our
judgment must be formed.
If passing occurrences sometimes act as checks upon the passions of democracy,
the intelligence and the manners of the community exercise an influence which
is not less powerful and far more permanent. This is extremely perceptible in
the United States.
In New England the education and the liberties of the communities were
engendered by the moral and religious principles of their founders. Where
society has acquired a sufficient degree of stability to enable it to hold
certain maxims and to retain fixed habits, the lower orders are accustomed to
respect intellectual superiority and to submit to it without complaint,
although they set at naught all those privileges which wealth and birth have
introduced among mankind. The democracy in New England consequently makes a
more judicious choice than it does elsewhere.
But as we descend towards the South, to those States in which the constitution
of society is more modern and less strong, where instruction is less general,
and where the principles of morality, of religion, and of liberty are less
happily combined, we perceive that the talents and the virtues of those who are
in authority become more and more rare.
Lastly, when we arrive at the new South-western States, in which the
constitution of society dates but from yesterday, and presents an agglomeration
of adventurers and speculators, we are amazed at the persons who are invested
with public authority, and we are led to ask by what force, independent of the
legislation and of the men who direct it, the State can be protected, and
society be made to flourish.
There are certain laws of a democratic nature which contribute, nevertheless,
to correct, in some measure, the dangerous tendencies of democracy. On entering
the House of Representatives of Washington one is struck by the vulgar demeanor
of that great assembly. The eye frequently does not discover a man of celebrity
within its walls. Its members are almost all obscure individuals whose names
present no associations to the mind: they are mostly village lawyers, men in
trade, or even persons belonging to the lower classes of society. In a country
in which education is very general, it is said that the representatives of the
people do not always know how to write correctly.
At a few yards’ distance from this spot is the door of the Senate, which
contains within a small space a large proportion of the celebrated men of
America. Scarcely an individual is to be perceived in it who does not recall
the idea of an active and illustrious career: the Senate is composed of
eloquent advocates, distinguished generals, wise magistrates, and statesmen of
note, whose language would at all times do honor to the most remarkable
parliamentary debates of Europe.
What then is the cause of this strange contrast, and why are the most able
citizens to be found in one assembly rather than in the other? Why is the
former body remarkable for its vulgarity and its poverty of talent, whilst the
latter seems to enjoy a monopoly of intelligence and of sound judgment? Both of
these assemblies emanate from the people; both of them are chosen by universal
suffrage; and no voice has hitherto been heard to assert in America that the
Senate is hostile to the interests of the people. From what cause, then, does
so startling a difference arise? The only reason which appears to me adequately
to account for it is, that the House of Representatives is elected by the
populace directly, and that the Senate is elected by elected bodies. The whole
body of the citizens names the legislature of each State, and the Federal
Constitution converts these legislatures into so many electoral bodies, which
return the members of the Senate. The senators are elected by an indirect
application of universal suffrage; for the legislatures which name them are not
aristocratic or privileged bodies which exercise the electoral franchise in
their own right; but they are chosen by the totality of the citizens; they are
generally elected every year, and new members may constantly be chosen who will
employ their electoral rights in conformity with the wishes of the public. But
this transmission of the popular authority through an assembly of chosen men
operates an important change in it, by refining its discretion and improving
the forms which it adopts. Men who are chosen in this manner accurately
represent the majority of the nation which governs them; but they represent the
elevated thoughts which are current in the community, the propensities which
prompt its nobler actions, rather than the petty passions which disturb or the
vices which disgrace it.
The time may be already anticipated at which the American Republics will be
obliged to introduce the plan of election by an elected body more frequently
into their system of representation, or they will incur no small risk of
perishing miserably amongst the shoals of democracy.
And here I have no scruple in confessing that I look upon this peculiar system
of election as the only means of bringing the exercise of political power to
the level of all classes of the people. Those thinkers who regard this
institution as the exclusive weapon of a party, and those who fear, on the
other hand, to make use of it, seem to me to fall into as great an error in the
one case as in the other.
Influence Which The American Democracy Has Exercised On The Laws Relating To
Elections
When elections are rare, they expose the State to a violent crisis—When
they are frequent, they keep up a degree of feverish excitement—The
Americans have preferred the second of these two evils—Mutability of the
laws—Opinions of Hamilton and Jefferson on this subject.
When elections recur at long intervals the State is exposed to violent
agitation every time they take place. Parties exert themselves to the utmost in
order to gain a prize which is so rarely within their reach; and as the evil is
almost irremediable for the candidates who fail, the consequences of their
disappointed ambition may prove most disastrous; if, on the other hand, the
legal struggle can be repeated within a short space of time, the defeated
parties take patience. When elections occur frequently, their recurrence keeps
society in a perpetual state of feverish excitement, and imparts a continual
instability to public affairs.
Thus, on the one hand the State is exposed to the perils of a revolution, on
the other to perpetual mutability; the former system threatens the very
existence of the Government, the latter is an obstacle to all steady and
consistent policy. The Americans have preferred the second of these evils to
the first; but they were led to this conclusion by their instinct much more
than by their reason; for a taste for variety is one of the characteristic
passions of democracy. An extraordinary mutability has, by this means, been
introduced into their legislation. Many of the Americans consider the
instability of their laws as a necessary consequence of a system whose general
results are beneficial. But no one in the United States affects to deny the
fact of this instability, or to contend that it is not a great evil.
Hamilton, after having demonstrated the utility of a power which might prevent,
or which might at least impede, the promulgation of bad laws, adds: “It
might perhaps be said that the power of preventing bad laws includes that of
preventing good ones, and may be used to the one purpose as well as to the
other. But this objection will have little weight with those who can properly
estimate the mischiefs of that inconstancy and mutability in the laws which
form the greatest blemish in the character and genius of our
governments.” (Federalist, No. 73.) And again in No. 62 of the same work
he observes: “The facility and excess of law-making seem to be the
diseases to which our governments are most liable. . . . The mischievous
effects of the mutability in the public councils arising from a rapid
succession of new members would fill a volume: every new election in the States
is found to change one-half of the representatives. From this change of men
must proceed a change of opinions and of measures, which forfeits the respect
and confidence of other nations, poisons the blessings of liberty itself, and
diminishes the attachment and reverence of the people toward a political system
which betrays so many marks of infirmity.”
Jefferson himself, the greatest Democrat whom the democracy of America has yet
produced, pointed out the same evils. “The instability of our
laws,” said he in a letter to Madison, “is really a very serious
inconvenience. I think that we ought to have obviated it by deciding that a
whole year should always be allowed to elapse between the bringing in of a bill
and the final passing of it. It should afterward be discussed and put to the
vote without the possibility of making any alteration in it; and if the
circumstances of the case required a more speedy decision, the question should
not be decided by a simple majority, but by a majority of at least two-thirds
of both houses.”
Public Officers Under The Control Of The Democracy In America Simple exterior
of the American public officers—No official costume—All public
officers are remunerated—Political consequences of this system—No
public career exists in America—Result of this.
Public officers in the United States are commingled with the crowd of citizens;
they have neither palaces, nor guards, nor ceremonial costumes. This simple
exterior of the persons in authority is connected not only with the
peculiarities of the American character, but with the fundamental principles of
that society. In the estimation of the democracy a government is not a benefit,
but a necessary evil. A certain degree of power must be granted to public
officers, for they would be of no use without it. But the ostensible semblance
of authority is by no means indispensable to the conduct of affairs, and it is
needlessly offensive to the susceptibility of the public. The public officers
themselves are well aware that they only enjoy the superiority over their
fellow-citizens which they derive from their authority upon condition of
putting themselves on a level with the whole community by their manners. A
public officer in the United States is uniformly civil, accessible to all the
world, attentive to all requests, and obliging in his replies. I was pleased by
these characteristics of a democratic government; and I was struck by the manly
independence of the citizens, who respect the office more than the officer, and
who are less attached to the emblems of authority than to the man who bears
them.
I am inclined to believe that the influence which costumes really exercise, in
an age like that in which we live, has been a good deal exaggerated. I never
perceived that a public officer in America was the less respected whilst he was
in the discharge of his duties because his own merit was set off by no
adventitious signs. On the other hand, it is very doubtful whether a peculiar
dress contributes to the respect which public characters ought to have for
their own position, at least when they are not otherwise inclined to respect
it. When a magistrate (and in France such instances are not rare) indulges his
trivial wit at the expense of the prisoner, or derides the predicament in which
a culprit is placed, it would be well to deprive him of his robes of office, to
see whether he would recall some portion of the natural dignity of mankind when
he is reduced to the apparel of a private citizen.
A democracy may, however, allow a certain show of magisterial pomp, and clothe
its officers in silks and gold, without seriously compromising its principles.
Privileges of this kind are transitory; they belong to the place, and are
distinct from the individual: but if public officers are not uniformly
remunerated by the State, the public charges must be entrusted to men of
opulence and independence, who constitute the basis of an aristocracy; and if
the people still retains its right of election, that election can only be made
from a certain class of citizens. When a democratic republic renders offices
which had formerly been remunerated gratuitous, it may safely be believed that
the State is advancing to monarchical institutions; and when a monarchy begins
to remunerate such officers as had hitherto been unpaid, it is a sure sign that
it is approaching toward a despotic or a republican form of government. The
substitution of paid for unpaid functionaries is of itself, in my opinion,
sufficient to constitute a serious revolution.
I look upon the entire absence of gratuitous functionaries in America as one of
the most prominent signs of the absolute dominion which democracy exercises in
that country. All public services, of whatsoever nature they may be, are paid;
so that every one has not merely the right, but also the means of performing
them. Although, in democratic States, all the citizens are qualified to occupy
stations in the Government, all are not tempted to try for them. The number and
the capacities of the candidates are more apt to restrict the choice of
electors than the connections of the candidateship.
In nations in which the principle of election extends to every place in the
State no political career can, properly speaking, be said to exist. Men are
promoted as if by chance to the rank which they enjoy, and they are by no means
sure of retaining it. The consequence is that in tranquil times public
functions offer but few lures to ambition. In the United States the persons who
engage in the perplexities of political life are individuals of very moderate
pretensions. The pursuit of wealth generally diverts men of great talents and
of great passions from the pursuit of power, and it very frequently happens
that a man does not undertake to direct the fortune of the State until he has
discovered his incompetence to conduct his own affairs. The vast number of very
ordinary men who occupy public stations is quite as attributable to these
causes as to the bad choice of the democracy. In the United States, I am not
sure that the people would return the men of superior abilities who might
solicit its support, but it is certain that men of this description do not come
forward.
Arbitrary Power Of Magistrates Under The Rule Of The American Democracy
For what reason the arbitrary power of Magistrates is greater in absolute
monarchies and in democratic republics than it is in limited
monarchies—Arbitrary power of the Magistrates in New England.
In two different kinds of government the magistrates *a exercise a considerable
degree of arbitrary power; namely, under the absolute government of a single
individual, and under that of a democracy. This identical result proceeds from
causes which are nearly analogous.
a 
[ I here use the word magistrates in the widest sense in which it can be taken;
I apply it to all the officers to whom the execution of the laws is intrusted.]
In despotic States the fortune of no citizen is secure; and public officers are
not more safe than private individuals. The sovereign, who has under his
control the lives, the property, and sometimes the honor of the men whom he
employs, does not scruple to allow them a great latitude of action, because he
is convinced that they will not use it to his prejudice. In despotic States the
sovereign is so attached to the exercise of his power, that he dislikes the
constraint even of his own regulations; and he is well pleased that his agents
should follow a somewhat fortuitous line of conduct, provided he be certain
that their actions will never counteract his desires.
In democracies, as the majority has every year the right of depriving the
officers whom it has appointed of their power, it has no reason to fear any
abuse of their authority. As the people is always able to signify its wishes to
those who conduct the Government, it prefers leaving them to make their own
exertions to prescribing an invariable rule of conduct which would at once
fetter their activity and the popular authority.
It may even be observed, on attentive consideration, that under the rule of a
democracy the arbitrary power of the magistrate must be still greater than in
despotic States. In the latter the sovereign has the power of punishing all the
faults with which he becomes acquainted, but it would be vain for him to hope
to become acquainted with all those which are committed. In the former the
sovereign power is not only supreme, but it is universally present. The
American functionaries are, in point of fact, much more independent in the
sphere of action which the law traces out for them than any public officer in
Europe. Very frequently the object which they are to accomplish is simply
pointed out to them, and the choice of the means is left to their own
discretion.
In New England, for instance, the selectmen of each township are bound to draw
up the list of persons who are to serve on the jury; the only rule which is
laid down to guide them in their choice is that they are to select citizens
possessing the elective franchise and enjoying a fair reputation. *b In France
the lives and liberties of the subjects would be thought to be in danger if a
public officer of any kind was entrusted with so formidable a right. In New
England the same magistrates are empowered to post the names of habitual
drunkards in public-houses, and to prohibit the inhabitants of a town from
supplying them with liquor. *c A censorial power of this excessive kind would
be revolting to the population of the most absolute monarchies; here, however,
it is submitted to without difficulty.
b 
[ See the Act of February 27, 1813. “General Collection of the Laws of
Massachusetts,” vol. ii. p. 331. It should be added that the jurors are
afterwards drawn from these lists by lot.]
c 
[ See Act of February 28, 1787. “General Collection of the Laws of
Massachusetts,” vol. i. p. 302.]
Nowhere has so much been left by the law to the arbitrary determination of the
magistrate as in democratic republics, because this arbitrary power is
unattended by any alarming consequences. It may even be asserted that the
freedom of the magistrate increases as the elective franchise is extended, and
as the duration of the time of office is shortened. Hence arises the great
difficulty which attends the conversion of a democratic republic into a
monarchy. The magistrate ceases to be elective, but he retains the rights and
the habits of an elected officer, which lead directly to despotism.
It is only in limited monarchies that the law, which prescribes the sphere in
which public officers are to act, superintends all their measures. The cause of
this may be easily detected. In limited monarchies the power is divided between
the King and the people, both of whom are interested in the stability of the
magistrate. The King does not venture to place the public officers under the
control of the people, lest they should be tempted to betray his interests; on
the other hand, the people fears lest the magistrates should serve to oppress
the liberties of the country, if they were entirely dependent upon the Crown;
they cannot therefore be said to depend on either one or the other. The same
cause which induces the king and the people to render public officers
independent suggests the necessity of such securities as may prevent their
independence from encroaching upon the authority of the former and the
liberties of the latter. They consequently agree as to the necessity of
restricting the functionary to a line of conduct laid down beforehand, and they
are interested in confining him by certain regulations which he cannot evade.
In America the public acts of a community frequently leave fewer traces than
the occurrences of a family—Newspapers the only historical
remains—Instability of the administration prejudicial to the art of
government.
The authority which public men possess in America is so brief, and they are so
soon commingled with the ever-changing population of the country, that the acts
of a community frequently leave fewer traces than the occurrences of a private
family. The public administration is, so to speak, oral and traditionary. But
little is committed to writing, and that little is wafted away forever, like
the leaves of the Sibyl, by the smallest breeze.
The only historical remains in the United States are the newspapers; but if a
number be wanting, the chain of time is broken, and the present is severed from
the past. I am convinced that in fifty years it will be more difficult to
collect authentic documents concerning the social condition of the Americans at
the present day than it is to find remains of the administration of France
during the Middle Ages; and if the United States were ever invaded by
barbarians, it would be necessary to have recourse to the history of other
nations in order to learn anything of the people which now inhabits them.
The instability of the administration has penetrated into the habits of the
people: it even appears to suit the general taste, and no one cares for what
occurred before his time. No methodical system is pursued; no archives are
formed; and no documents are brought together when it would be very easy to do
so. Where they exist, little store is set upon them; and I have amongst my
papers several original public documents which were given to me in answer to
some of my inquiries. In America society seems to live from hand to mouth, like
an army in the field. Nevertheless, the art of administration may undoubtedly
be ranked as a science, and no sciences can be improved if the discoveries and
observations of successive generations are not connected together in the order
in which they occur. One man, in the short space of his life remarks a fact;
another conceives an idea; the former invents a means of execution, the latter
reduces a truth to a fixed proposition; and mankind gathers the fruits of
individual experience upon its way and gradually forms the sciences. But the
persons who conduct the administration in America can seldom afford any
instruction to each other; and when they assume the direction of society, they
simply possess those attainments which are most widely disseminated in the
community, and no experience peculiar to themselves. Democracy, carried to its
furthest limits, is therefore prejudicial to the art of government; and for
this reason it is better adapted to a people already versed in the conduct of
an administration than to a nation which is uninitiated in public affairs.
This remark, indeed, is not exclusively applicable to the science of
administration. Although a democratic government is founded upon a very simple
and natural principle, it always presupposes the existence of a high degree of
culture and enlightenment in society. *d At the first glance it may be imagined
to belong to the earliest ages of the world; but maturer observation will
convince us that it could only come last in the succession of human history.

[ It is needless to observe that I speak here of the democratic form of
government as applied to a people, not merely to a tribe.]
Charges Levied By The State Under The Rule Of The American Democracy
In all communities citizens divisible into three classes—Habits of each
of these classes in the direction of public finances—Why public
expenditure must tend to increase when the people governs—What renders
the extravagance of a democracy less to be feared in America—Public
expenditure under a democracy.
Before we can affirm whether a democratic form of government is economical or
not, we must establish a suitable standard of comparison. The question would be
one of easy solution if we were to attempt to draw a parallel between a
democratic republic and an absolute monarchy. The public expenditure would be
found to be more considerable under the former than under the latter; such is
the case with all free States compared to those which are not so. It is certain
that despotism ruins individuals by preventing them from producing wealth, much
more than by depriving them of the wealth they have produced; it dries up the
source of riches, whilst it usually respects acquired property. Freedom, on the
contrary, engenders far more benefits than it destroys; and the nations which
are favored by free institutions invariably find that their resources increase
even more rapidly than their taxes.
My present object is to compare free nations to each other, and to point out
the influence of democracy upon the finances of a State.
Communities, as well as organic bodies, are subject to certain fixed rules in
their formation which they cannot evade. They are composed of certain elements
which are common to them at all times and under all circumstances. The people
may always be mentally divided into three distinct classes. The first of these
classes consists of the wealthy; the second, of those who are in easy
circumstances; and the third is composed of those who have little or no
property, and who subsist more especially by the work which they perform for
the two superior orders. The proportion of the individuals who are included in
these three divisions may vary according to the condition of society, but the
divisions themselves can never be obliterated.
It is evident that each of these classes will exercise an influence peculiar to
its own propensities upon the administration of the finances of the State. If
the first of the three exclusively possesses the legislative power, it is
probable that it will not be sparing of the public funds, because the taxes
which are levied on a large fortune only tend to diminish the sum of
superfluous enjoyment, and are, in point of fact, but little felt. If the
second class has the power of making the laws, it will certainly not be lavish
of taxes, because nothing is so onerous as a large impost which is levied upon
a small income. The government of the middle classes appears to me to be the
most economical, though perhaps not the most enlightened, and certainly not the
most generous, of free governments.
But let us now suppose that the legislative authority is vested in the lowest
orders: there are two striking reasons which show that the tendency of the
expenditure will be to increase, not to diminish. As the great majority of
those who create the laws are possessed of no property upon which taxes can be
imposed, all the money which is spent for the community appears to be spent to
their advantage, at no cost of their own; and those who are possessed of some
little property readily find means of regulating the taxes so that they are
burdensome to the wealthy and profitable to the poor, although the rich are
unable to take the same advantage when they are in possession of the
Government.
In countries in which the poor *e should be exclusively invested with the power
of making the laws no great economy of public expenditure ought to be expected:
that expenditure will always be considerable; either because the taxes do not
weigh upon those who levy them, or because they are levied in such a manner as
not to weigh upon those classes. In other words, the government of the
democracy is the only one under which the power which lays on taxes escapes the
payment of them.
e 
[ The word poor is used here, and throughout the remainder of this chapter, in
a relative, not in an absolute sense. Poor men in America would often appear
rich in comparison with the poor of Europe; but they may with propriety by
styled poor in comparison with their more affluent countrymen.]
It may be objected (but the argument has no real weight) that the true interest
of the people is indissolubly connected with that of the wealthier portion of
the community, since it cannot but suffer by the severe measures to which it
resorts. But is it not the true interest of kings to render their subjects
happy, and the true interest of nobles to admit recruits into their order on
suitable grounds? If remote advantages had power to prevail over the passions
and the exigencies of the moment, no such thing as a tyrannical sovereign or an
exclusive aristocracy could ever exist.
Again, it may be objected that the poor are never invested with the sole power
of making the laws; but I reply, that wherever universal suffrage has been
established the majority of the community unquestionably exercises the
legislative authority; and if it be proved that the poor always constitute the
majority, it may be added, with perfect truth, that in the countries in which
they possess the elective franchise they possess the sole power of making laws.
But it is certain that in all the nations of the world the greater number has
always consisted of those persons who hold no property, or of those whose
property is insufficient to exempt them from the necessity of working in order
to procure an easy subsistence. Universal suffrage does therefore, in point of
fact, invest the poor with the government of society.
The disastrous influence which popular authority may sometimes exercise upon
the finances of a State was very clearly seen in some of the democratic
republics of antiquity, in which the public treasure was exhausted in order to
relieve indigent citizens, or to supply the games and theatrical amusements of
the populace. It is true that the representative system was then very
imperfectly known, and that, at the present time, the influence of popular
passion is less felt in the conduct of public affairs; but it may be believed
that the delegate will in the end conform to the principles of his
constituents, and favor their propensities as much as their interests.
The extravagance of democracy is, however, less to be dreaded in proportion as
the people acquires a share of property, because on the one hand the
contributions of the rich are then less needed, and, on the other, it is more
difficult to lay on taxes which do not affect the interests of the lower
classes. On this account universal suffrage would be less dangerous in France
than in England, because in the latter country the property on which taxes may
be levied is vested in fewer hands. America, where the great majority of the
citizens possess some fortune, is in a still more favorable position than
France.
There are still further causes which may increase the sum of public expenditure
in democratic countries. When the aristocracy governs, the individuals who
conduct the affairs of State are exempted by their own station in society from
every kind of privation; they are contented with their position; power and
renown are the objects for which they strive; and, as they are placed far above
the obscurer throng of citizens, they do not always distinctly perceive how the
well-being of the mass of the people ought to redound to their own honor. They
are not indeed callous to the sufferings of the poor, but they cannot feel
those miseries as acutely as if they were themselves partakers of them.
Provided that the people appear to submit to its lot, the rulers are satisfied,
and they demand nothing further from the Government. An aristocracy is more
intent upon the means of maintaining its influence than upon the means of
improving its condition.
When, on the contrary, the people is invested with the supreme authority, the
perpetual sense of their own miseries impels the rulers of society to seek for
perpetual ameliorations. A thousand different objects are subjected to
improvement; the most trivial details are sought out as susceptible of
amendment; and those changes which are accompanied with considerable expense
are more especially advocated, since the object is to render the condition of
the poor more tolerable, who cannot pay for themselves.
Moreover, all democratic communities are agitated by an ill-defined excitement
and by a kind of feverish impatience, that engender a multitude of innovations,
almost all of which are attended with expense.
In monarchies and aristocracies the natural taste which the rulers have for
power and for renown is stimulated by the promptings of ambition, and they are
frequently incited by these temptations to very costly undertakings. In
democracies, where the rulers labor under privations, they can only be courted
by such means as improve their well-being, and these improvements cannot take
place without a sacrifice of money. When a people begins to reflect upon its
situation, it discovers a multitude of wants to which it had not before been
subject, and to satisfy these exigencies recourse must be had to the coffers of
the State. Hence it arises that the public charges increase in proportion as
civilization spreads, and that imposts are augmented as knowledge pervades the
community.
The last cause which frequently renders a democratic government dearer than any
other is, that a democracy does not always succeed in moderating its
expenditure, because it does not understand the art of being economical. As the
designs which it entertains are frequently changed, and the agents of those
designs are still more frequently removed, its undertakings are often ill
conducted or left unfinished: in the former case the State spends sums out of
all proportion to the end which it proposes to accomplish; in the second, the
expense itself is unprofitable. *f

[ The gross receipts of the Treasury of the United States in 1832 were about
$28,000,000; in 1870 they had risen to $411,000,000. The gross expenditure in
1832 was $30,000,000; in 1870, $309,000,000.]
Tendencies Of The American Democracy As Regards The Salaries Of Public Officers
In the democracies those who establish high salaries have no chance of
profiting by them—Tendency of the American democracy to increase the
salaries of subordinate officers and to lower those of the more important
functionaries—Reason of this—Comparative statement of the salaries
of public officers in the United States and in France.
There is a powerful reason which usually induces democracies to economize upon
the salaries of public officers. As the number of citizens who dispense the
remuneration is extremely large in democratic countries, so the number of
persons who can hope to be benefited by the receipt of it is comparatively
small. In aristocratic countries, on the contrary, the individuals who fix high
salaries have almost always a vague hope of profiting by them. These
appointments may be looked upon as a capital which they create for their own
use, or at least as a resource for their children.
It must, however, be allowed that a democratic State is most parsimonious
towards its principal agents. In America the secondary officers are much better
paid, and the dignitaries of the administration much worse, than they are
elsewhere.
These opposite effects result from the same cause; the people fixes the
salaries of the public officers in both cases; and the scale of remuneration is
determined by the consideration of its own wants. It is held to be fair that
the servants of the public should be placed in the same easy circumstances as
the public itself; *g but when the question turns upon the salaries of the
great officers of State, this rule fails, and chance alone can guide the
popular decision. The poor have no adequate conception of the wants which the
higher classes of society may feel. The sum which is scanty to the rich appears
enormous to the poor man whose wants do not extend beyond the necessaries of
life; and in his estimation the Governor of a State, with his twelve or fifteen
hundred dollars a year, is a very fortunate and enviable being. *h If you
undertake to convince him that the representative of a great people ought to be
able to maintain some show of splendor in the eyes of foreign nations, he will
perhaps assent to your meaning; but when he reflects on his own humble
dwelling, and on the hard-earned produce of his wearisome toil, he remembers
all that he could do with a salary which you say is insufficient, and he is
startled or almost frightened at the sight of such uncommon wealth. Besides,
the secondary public officer is almost on a level with the people, whilst the
others are raised above it. The former may therefore excite his interest, but
the latter begins to arouse his envy.
g 
[ The easy circumstances in which secondary functionaries are placed in the
United States result also from another cause, which is independent of the
general tendencies of democracy; every kind of private business is very
lucrative, and the State would not be served at all if it did not pay its
servants. The country is in the position of a commercial undertaking, which is
obliged to sustain an expensive competition, notwithstanding its tastes for
economy.]
h 
[ The State of Ohio, which contains a million of inhabitants, gives its
Governor a salary of only $1,200 a year.]
This is very clearly seen in the United States, where the salaries seem to
decrease as the authority of those who receive them augments *i
i 
[ To render this assertion perfectly evident, it will suffice to examine the
scale of salaries of the agents of the Federal Government. I have added the
salaries attached to the corresponding officers in France under the
constitutional monarchy to complete the comparison.
United States
     Treasury Department
     Messenger ............................   $700
     Clerk with lowest salary .............  1,000
     Clerk with highest salary ............  1,600
     Chief Clerk ..........................  2,000
     Secretary of State ...................  6,000
     The President ........................ 25,000

     France
     Ministere des Finances
     Hussier ........................... 1,500 fr.
     Clerk with lowest salary,  1,000 to 1,800 fr.
     Clerk with highest salary  3,200 to 8,600 fr.
     Secretaire-general ................20,000 fr.
     The Minister ......................80,000 fr.
     The King ......................12,000,000 fr.
I have perhaps done wrong in selecting France as my standard of comparison. In
France the democratic tendencies of the nation exercise an ever-increasing
influence upon the Government, and the Chambers show a disposition to raise the
low salaries and to lower the principal ones. Thus, the Minister of Finance,
who received 160,000 fr. under the Empire, receives 80,000 fr. in 1835: the
Directeurs-generaux of Finance, who then received 50,000 fr. now receive only
20,000 fr. [This comparison is based on the state of things existing in France
and the United States in 1831. It has since materially altered in both
countries, but not so much as to impugn the truth of the author’s
observation.]]
Under the rule of an aristocracy it frequently happens, on the contrary, that
whilst the high officers are receiving munificent salaries, the inferior ones
have not more than enough to procure the necessaries of life. The reason of
this fact is easily discoverable from causes very analogous to those to which I
have just alluded. If a democracy is unable to conceive the pleasures of the
rich or to witness them without envy, an aristocracy is slow to understand, or,
to speak more correctly, is unacquainted with, the privations of the poor. The
poor man is not (if we use the term aright) the fellow of the rich one; but he
is a being of another species. An aristocracy is therefore apt to care but
little for the fate of its subordinate agents; and their salaries are only
raised when they refuse to perform their service for too scanty a remuneration.
It is the parsimonious conduct of democracy towards its principal officers
which has countenanced a supposition of far more economical propensities than
any which it really possesses. It is true that it scarcely allows the means of
honorable subsistence to the individuals who conduct its affairs; but enormous
sums are lavished to meet the exigencies or to facilitate the enjoyments of the
people. *j The money raised by taxation may be better employed, but it is not
saved. In general, democracy gives largely to the community, and very sparingly
to those who govern it. The reverse is the case in aristocratic countries,
where the money of the State is expended to the profit of the persons who are
at the head of affairs.

instruction. (William’s “New York Annual Register,” 1832, pp.

Difficulty of Distinguishing The Causes Which Contribute To The Economy Of The
American Government
We are liable to frequent errors in the research of those facts which exercise
a serious influence upon the fate of mankind, since nothing is more difficult
than to appreciate their real value. One people is naturally inconsistent and
enthusiastic; another is sober and calculating; and these characteristics
originate in their physical constitution or in remote causes with which we are
unacquainted.
These are nations which are fond of parade and the bustle of festivity, and
which do not regret the costly gaieties of an hour. Others, on the contrary,
are attached to more retiring pleasures, and seem almost ashamed of appearing
to be pleased. In some countries the highest value is set upon the beauty of
public edifices; in others the productions of art are treated with
indifference, and everything which is unproductive is looked down upon with
contempt. In some renown, in others money, is the ruling passion.
Independently of the laws, all these causes concur to exercise a very powerful
influence upon the conduct of the finances of the State. If the Americans never
spend the money of the people in galas, it is not only because the imposition
of taxes is under the control of the people, but because the people takes no
delight in public rejoicings. If they repudiate all ornament from their
architecture, and set no store on any but the more practical and homely
advantages, it is not only because they live under democratic institutions, but
because they are a commercial nation. The habits of private life are continued
in public; and we ought carefully to distinguish that economy which depends
upon their institutions from that which is the natural result of their manners
and customs.
Whether The Expenditure Of The United States Can Be Compared To That Of France
Two points to be established in order to estimate the extent of the public
charges, viz., the national wealth and the rate of taxation—The wealth
and the charges of France not accurately known—Why the wealth and charges
of the Union cannot be accurately known—Researches of the author with a
view to discover the amount of taxation of Pennsylvania—General symptoms
which may serve to indicate the amount of the public charges in a given
nation—Result of this investigation for the Union.
Many attempts have recently been made in France to compare the public
expenditure of that country with the expenditure of the United States; all
these attempts have, however, been unattended by success, and a few words will
suffice to show that they could not have had a satisfactory result.
In order to estimate the amount of the public charges of a people two
preliminaries are indispensable: it is necessary, in the first place, to know
the wealth of that people; and in the second, to learn what portion of that
wealth is devoted to the expenditure of the State. To show the amount of
taxation without showing the resources which are destined to meet the demand,
is to undertake a futile labor; for it is not the expenditure, but the relation
of the expenditure to the revenue, which it is desirable to know.
The same rate of taxation which may easily be supported by a wealthy
contributor will reduce a poor one to extreme misery. The wealth of nations is
composed of several distinct elements, of which population is the first, real
property the second, and personal property the third. The first of these three
elements may be discovered without difficulty. Amongst civilized nations it is
easy to obtain an accurate census of the inhabitants; but the two others cannot
be determined with so much facility. It is difficult to take an exact account
of all the lands in a country which are under cultivation, with their natural
or their acquired value; and it is still more impossible to estimate the entire
personal property which is at the disposal of a nation, and which eludes the
strictest analysis by the diversity and the number of shapes under which it may
occur. And, indeed, we find that the most ancient civilized nations of Europe,
including even those in which the administration is most central, have not
succeeded, as yet, in determining the exact condition of their wealth.
In America the attempt has never been made; for how would such an investigation
be possible in a country where society has not yet settled into habits of
regularity and tranquillity; where the national Government is not assisted by a
multiple of agents whose exertions it can command and direct to one sole end;
and where statistics are not studied, because no one is able to collect the
necessary documents, or to find time to peruse them? Thus the primary elements
of the calculations which have been made in France cannot be obtained in the
Union; the relative wealth of the two countries is unknown; the property of the
former is not accurately determined, and no means exist of computing that of
the latter.
I consent, therefore, for the sake of the discussion, to abandon this necessary
term of the comparison, and I confine myself to a computation of the actual
amount of taxation, without investigating the relation which subsists between
the taxation and the revenue. But the reader will perceive that my task has not
been facilitated by the limits which I here lay down for my researches.
It cannot be doubted that the central administration of France, assisted by all
the public officers who are at its disposal, might determine with exactitude
the amount of the direct and indirect taxes levied upon the citizens. But this
investigation, which no private individual can undertake, has not hitherto been
completed by the French Government, or, at least, its results have not been
made public. We are acquainted with the sum total of the charges of the State;
we know the amount of the departmental expenditure; but the expenses of the
communal divisions have not been computed, and the amount of the public
expenses of France is consequently unknown.
If we now turn to America, we shall perceive that the difficulties are
multiplied and enhanced. The Union publishes an exact return of the amount of
its expenditure; the budgets of the four and twenty States furnish similar
returns of their revenues; but the expenses incident to the affairs of the
counties and the townships are unknown. *k
k 
[ The Americans, as we have seen, have four separate budgets, the Union, the
States, the Counties, and the Townships having each severally their own. During
my stay in America I made every endeavor to discover the amount of the public
expenditure in the townships and counties of the principal States of the Union,
and I readily obtained the budget of the larger townships, but I found it quite
impossible to procure that of the smaller ones. I possess, however, some
documents relating to county expenses, which, although incomplete, are still
curious. I have to thank Mr. Richards, Mayor of Philadelphia, for the budgets
of thirteen of the counties of Pennsylvania, viz., Lebanon, Centre, Franklin,
Fayette, Montgomery, Luzerne, Dauphin, Butler, Alleghany, Columbia,
Northampton, Northumberland, and Philadelphia, for the year 1830. Their
population at that time consisted of 495,207 inhabitants. On looking at the map
of Pennsylvania, it will be seen that these thirteen counties are scattered in
every direction, and so generally affected by the causes which usually
influence the condition of a country, that they may easily be supposed to
furnish a correct average of the financial state of the counties of
Pennsylvania in general; and thus, upon reckoning that the expenses of these
counties amounted in the year 1830 to about $361,650, or nearly 75 cents for
each inhabitant, and calculating that each of them contributed in the same year
about $2.55 towards the Union, and about 75 cents to the State of Pennsylvania,
it appears that they each contributed as their share of all the public expenses
(except those of the townships) the sum of $4.05. This calculation is doubly
incomplete, as it applies only to a single year and to one part of the public
charges; but it has at least the merit of not being conjectural.]
The authority of the Federal government cannot oblige the provincial
governments to throw any light upon this point; and even if these governments
were inclined to afford their simultaneous co-operation, it may be doubted
whether they possess the means of procuring a satisfactory answer.
Independently of the natural difficulties of the task, the political
organization of the country would act as a hindrance to the success of their
efforts. The county and town magistrates are not appointed by the authorities
of the State, and they are not subjected to their control. It is therefore very
allowable to suppose that, if the State was desirous of obtaining the returns
which we require, its design would be counteracted by the neglect of those
subordinate officers whom it would be obliged to employ. *l It is, in point of
fact, useless to inquire what the Americans might do to forward this inquiry,
since it is certain that they have hitherto done nothing at all. There does not
exist a single individual at the present day, in America or in Europe, who can
inform us what each citizen of the Union annually contributes to the public
charges of the nation. *m [Footnote l: Those who have attempted to draw a
comparison between the expenses of France and America have at once perceived
that no such comparison could be drawn between the total expenditure of the two
countries; but they have endeavored to contrast detached portions of this
expenditure. It may readily be shown that this second system is not at all less
defective than the first. If I attempt to compare the French budget with the
budget of the Union, it must be remembered that the latter embraces much fewer
objects than then central Government of the former country, and that the
expenditure must consequently be much smaller. If I contrast the budgets of the
Departments with those of the States which constitute the Union, it must be
observed that, as the power and control exercised by the States is much greater
than that which is exercised by the Departments, their expenditure is also more
considerable. As for the budgets of the counties, nothing of the kind occurs in
the French system of finances; and it is, again, doubtful whether the
corresponding expenses should be referred to the budget of the State or to
those of the municipal divisions. Municipal expenses exist in both countries,
but they are not always analogous. In America the townships discharge a variety
of offices which are reserved in France to the Departments or to the State. It
may, moreover, be asked what is to be understood by the municipal expenses of
America. The organization of the municipal bodies or townships differs in the
several States. Are we to be guided by what occurs in New England or in
Georgia, in Pennsylvania or in the State of Illinois? A kind of analogy may
very readily be perceived between certain budgets in the two countries; but as
the elements of which they are composed always differ more or less, no fair
comparison can be instituted between them. [The same difficulty exists, perhaps
to a greater degree at the present time, when the taxation of America has
largely increased.—1874.]]
m 
[ Even if we knew the exact pecuniary contributions of every French and
American citizen to the coffers of the State, we should only come at a portion
of the truth. Governments do not only demand supplies of money, but they call
for personal services, which may be looked upon as equivalent to a given sum.
When a State raises an army, besides the pay of the troops, which is furnished
by the entire nation, each soldier must give up his time, the value of which
depends on the use he might make of it if he were not in the service. The same
remark applies to the militia; the citizen who is in the militia devotes a
certain portion of valuable time to the maintenance of the public peace, and he
does in reality surrender to the State those earnings which he is prevented
from gaining. Many other instances might be cited in addition to these. The
governments of France and of America both levy taxes of this kind, which weigh
upon the citizens; but who can estimate with accuracy their relative amount in
the two countries?
This, however, is not the last of the difficulties which prevent us from
comparing the expenditure of the Union with that of France. The French
Government contracts certain obligations which do not exist in America, and
vice versa. The French Government pays the clergy; in America the voluntary
principle prevails. In America there is a legal provision for the poor; in
France they are abandoned to the charity of the public. The French public
officers are paid by a fixed salary; in America they are allowed certain
perquisites. In France contributions in kind take place on very few roads; in
America upon almost all the thoroughfares: in the former country the roads are
free to all travellers; in the latter turnpikes abound. All these differences
in the manner in which contributions are levied in the two countries enhance
the difficulty of comparing their expenditure; for there are certain expenses
which the citizens would not be subject to, or which would at any rate be much
less considerable, if the State did not take upon itself to act in the name of
the public.]
Hence we must conclude that it is no less difficult to compare the social
expenditure than it is to estimate the relative wealth of France and America. I
will even add that it would be dangerous to attempt this comparison; for when
statistics are not based upon computations which are strictly accurate, they
mislead instead of guiding aright. The mind is easily imposed upon by the false
affectation of exactness, which prevails even in the misstatements of science,
and it adopts with confidence errors which are dressed in the forms of
mathematical truth.
We abandon, therefore, our numerical investigation, with the hope of meeting
with data of another kind. In the absence of positive documents, we may form an
opinion as to the proportion which the taxation of a people bears to its real
prosperity, by observing whether its external appearance is flourishing;
whether, after having discharged the calls of the State, the poor man retains
the means of subsistence, and the rich the means of enjoyment; and whether both
classes are contented with their position, seeking, however, to ameliorate it
by perpetual exertions, so that industry is never in want of capital, nor
capital unemployed by industry. The observer who draws his inferences from
these signs will, undoubtedly, be led to the conclusion that the American of
the United States contributes a much smaller portion of his income to the State
than the citizen of France. Nor, indeed, can the result be otherwise.
A portion of the French debt is the consequence of two successive invasions;
and the Union has no similar calamity to fear. A nation placed upon the
continent of Europe is obliged to maintain a large standing army; the isolated
position of the Union enables it to have only 6,000 soldiers. The French have a
fleet of 300 sail; the Americans have 52 vessels. *n How, then, can the
inhabitants of the Union be called upon to contribute as largely as the
inhabitants of France? No parallel can be drawn between the finances of two
countries so differently situated.
n 
[ See the details in the Budget of the French Minister of Marine; and for
America, the National Calendar of 1833, p. 228. [But the public debt of the
United States in 1870, caused by the Civil War, amounted to $2,480,672,427;
that of France was more than doubled by the extravagance of the Second Empire
and by the war of 1870.]]
It is by examining what actually takes place in the Union, and not by comparing
the Union with France, that we may discover whether the American Government is
really economical. On casting my eyes over the different republics which form
the confederation, I perceive that their Governments lack perseverance in their
undertakings, and that they exercise no steady control over the men whom they
employ. Whence I naturally infer that they must often spend the money of the
people to no purpose, or consume more of it than is really necessary to their
undertakings. Great efforts are made, in accordance with the democratic origin
of society, to satisfy the exigencies of the lower orders, to open the career
of power to their endeavors, and to diffuse knowledge and comfort amongst them.
The poor are maintained, immense sums are annually devoted to public
instruction, all services whatsoever are remunerated, and the most subordinate
agents are liberally paid. If this kind of government appears to me to be
useful and rational, I am nevertheless constrained to admit that it is
expensive.
Wherever the poor direct public affairs and dispose of the national resources,
it appears certain that, as they profit by the expenditure of the State, they
are apt to augment that expenditure.
I conclude, therefore, without having recourse to inaccurate computations, and
without hazarding a comparison which might prove incorrect, that the democratic
government of the Americans is not a cheap government, as is sometimes
asserted; and I have no hesitation in predicting that, if the people of the
United States is ever involved in serious difficulties, its taxation will
speedily be increased to the rate of that which prevails in the greater part of
the aristocracies and the monarchies of Europe. *o
o 
[ [That is precisely what has since occurred.]]
Corruption And Vices Of The Rulers In A Democracy, And Consequent Effects Upon
Public Morality
In aristocracies rulers sometimes endeavor to corrupt the people—In
democracies rulers frequently show themselves to be corrupt—In the former
their vices are directly prejudicial to the morality of the people—In the
latter their indirect influence is still more pernicious.
A distinction must be made, when the aristocratic and the democratic principles
mutually inveigh against each other, as tending to facilitate corruption. In
aristocratic governments the individuals who are placed at the head of affairs
are rich men, who are solely desirous of power. In democracies statesmen are
poor, and they have their fortunes to make. The consequence is that in
aristocratic States the rulers are rarely accessible to corruption, and have
very little craving for money; whilst the reverse is the case in democratic
nations.
But in aristocracies, as those who are desirous of arriving at the head of
affairs are possessed of considerable wealth, and as the number of persons by
whose assistance they may rise is comparatively small, the government is, if I
may use the expression, put up to a sort of auction. In democracies, on the
contrary, those who are covetous of power are very seldom wealthy, and the
number of citizens who confer that power is extremely great. Perhaps in
democracies the number of men who might be bought is by no means smaller, but
buyers are rarely to be met with; and, besides, it would be necessary to buy so
many persons at once that the attempt is rendered nugatory.
Many of the men who have been in the administration in France during the last
forty years have been accused of making their fortunes at the expense of the
State or of its allies; a reproach which was rarely addressed to the public
characters of the ancient monarchy. But in France the practice of bribing
electors is almost unknown, whilst it is notoriously and publicly carried on in
England. In the United States I never heard a man accused of spending his
wealth in corrupting the populace; but I have often heard the probity of public
officers questioned; still more frequently have I heard their success
attributed to low intrigues and immoral practices.
If, then, the men who conduct the government of an aristocracy sometimes
endeavor to corrupt the people, the heads of a democracy are themselves
corrupt. In the former case the morality of the people is directly assailed; in
the latter an indirect influence is exercised upon the people which is still
more to be dreaded.
As the rulers of democratic nations are almost always exposed to the suspicion
of dishonorable conduct, they in some measure lend the authority of the
Government to the base practices of which they are accused. They thus afford an
example which must prove discouraging to the struggles of virtuous
independence, and must foster the secret calculations of a vicious ambition. If
it be asserted that evil passions are displayed in all ranks of society, that
they ascend the throne by hereditary right, and that despicable characters are
to be met with at the head of aristocratic nations as well as in the sphere of
a democracy, this objection has but little weight in my estimation. The
corruption of men who have casually risen to power has a coarse and vulgar
infection in it which renders it contagious to the multitude. On the contrary,
there is a kind of aristocratic refinement and an air of grandeur in the
depravity of the great, which frequently prevent it from spreading abroad.
The people can never penetrate into the perplexing labyrinth of court intrigue,
and it will always have difficulty in detecting the turpitude which lurks under
elegant manners, refined tastes, and graceful language. But to pillage the
public purse, and to vend the favors of the State, are arts which the meanest
villain may comprehend, and hope to practice in his turn.
In reality it is far less prejudicial to witness the immorality of the great
than to witness that immorality which leads to greatness. In a democracy
private citizens see a man of their own rank in life, who rises from that
obscure position, and who becomes possessed of riches and of power in a few
years; the spectacle excites their surprise and their envy, and they are led to
inquire how the person who was yesterday their equal is to-day their ruler. To
attribute his rise to his talents or his virtues is unpleasant; for it is
tacitly to acknowledge that they are themselves less virtuous and less talented
than he was. They are therefore led (and not unfrequently their conjecture is a
correct one) to impute his success mainly to some one of his defects; and an
odious mixture is thus formed of the ideas of turpitude and power, unworthiness
and success, utility and dishonor.
Efforts Of Which A Democracy Is Capable
The Union has only had one struggle hitherto for its existence—Enthusiasm
at the commencement of the war—Indifference towards its
close—Difficulty of establishing military conscription or impressment of
seamen in America—Why a democratic people is less capable of sustained
effort than another.
I here warn the reader that I speak of a government which implicitly follows
the real desires of a people, and not of a government which simply commands in
its name. Nothing is so irresistible as a tyrannical power commanding in the
name of the people, because, whilst it exercises that moral influence which
belongs to the decision of the majority, it acts at the same time with the
promptitude and the tenacity of a single man.
It is difficult to say what degree of exertion a democratic government may be
capable of making a crisis in the history of the nation. But no great
democratic republic has hitherto existed in the world. To style the oligarchy
which ruled over France in 1793 by that name would be to offer an insult to the
republican form of government. The United States afford the first example of
the kind.
The American Union has now subsisted for half a century, in the course of which
time its existence has only once been attacked, namely, during the War of
Independence. At the commencement of that long war, various occurrences took
place which betokened an extraordinary zeal for the service of the country. *p
But as the contest was prolonged, symptoms of private egotism began to show
themselves. No money was poured into the public treasury; few recruits could be
raised to join the army; the people wished to acquire independence, but was
very ill-disposed to undergo the privations by which alone it could be
obtained. “Tax laws,” says Hamilton in the “Federalist”
(No. 12), “have in vain been multiplied; new methods to enforce the
collection have in vain been tried; the public expectation has been uniformly
disappointed and the treasuries of the States have remained empty. The popular
system of administration inherent in the nature of popular government,
coinciding with the real scarcity of money incident to a languid and mutilated
state of trade, has hitherto defeated every experiment for extensive
collections, and has at length taught the different legislatures the folly of
attempting them.”
p 
[ One of the most singular of these occurrences was the resolution which the
Americans took of temporarily abandoning the use of tea. Those who know that
men usually cling more to their habits than to their life will doubtless admire
this great though obscure sacrifice which was made by a whole people.]
The United States have not had any serious war to carry on ever since that
period. In order, therefore, to appreciate the sacrifices which democratic
nations may impose upon themselves, we must wait until the American people is
obliged to put half its entire income at the disposal of the Government, as was
done by the English; or until it sends forth a twentieth part of its population
to the field of battle, as was done by France. *q
q 
[ [The Civil War showed that when the necessity arose the American people, both
in the North and in the South, are capable of making the most enormous
sacrifices, both in money and in men.]]
In America the use of conscription is unknown, and men are induced to enlist by
bounties. The notions and habits of the people of the United States are so
opposed to compulsory enlistment that I do not imagine it can ever be
sanctioned by the laws. What is termed the conscription in France is assuredly
the heaviest tax upon the population of that country; yet how could a great
continental war be carried on without it? The Americans have not adopted the
British impressment of seamen, and they have nothing which corresponds to the
French system of maritime conscription; the navy, as well as the merchant
service, is supplied by voluntary service. But it is not easy to conceive how a
people can sustain a great maritime war without having recourse to one or the
other of these two systems. Indeed, the Union, which has fought with some honor
upon the seas, has never possessed a very numerous fleet, and the equipment of
the small number of American vessels has always been excessively expensive.
I have heard American statesmen confess that the Union will have great
difficulty in maintaining its rank on the seas without adopting the system of
impressment or of maritime conscription; but the difficulty is to induce the
people, which exercises the supreme authority, to submit to impressment or any
compulsory system.
It is incontestable that in times of danger a free people displays far more
energy than one which is not so. But I incline to believe that this is more
especially the case in those free nations in which the democratic element
preponderates. Democracy appears to me to be much better adapted for the
peaceful conduct of society, or for an occasional effort of remarkable vigor,
than for the hardy and prolonged endurance of the storms which beset the
political existence of nations. The reason is very evident; it is enthusiasm
which prompts men to expose themselves to dangers and privations, but they will
not support them long without reflection. There is more calculation, even in
the impulses of bravery, than is generally attributed to them; and although the
first efforts are suggested by passion, perseverance is maintained by a
distinct regard of the purpose in view. A portion of what we value is exposed,
in order to save the remainder.
But it is this distinct perception of the future, founded upon a sound judgment
and an enlightened experience, which is most frequently wanting in democracies.
The populace is more apt to feel than to reason; and if its present sufferings
are great, it is to be feared that the still greater sufferings attendant upon
defeat will be forgotten.
Another cause tends to render the efforts of a democratic government less
persevering than those of an aristocracy. Not only are the lower classes less
awakened than the higher orders to the good or evil chances of the future, but
they are liable to suffer far more acutely from present privations. The noble
exposes his life, indeed, but the chance of glory is equal to the chance of
harm. If he sacrifices a large portion of his income to the State, he deprives
himself for a time of the pleasures of affluence; but to the poor man death is
embellished by no pomp or renown, and the imposts which are irksome to the rich
are fatal to him.
This relative impotence of democratic republics is, perhaps, the greatest
obstacle to the foundation of a republic of this kind in Europe. In order that
such a State should subsist in one country of the Old World, it would be
necessary that similar institutions should be introduced into all the other
nations.
I am of opinion that a democratic government tends in the end to increase the
real strength of society; but it can never combine, upon a single point and at
a given time, so much power as an aristocracy or a monarchy. If a democratic
country remained during a whole century subject to a republican government, it
would probably at the end of that period be more populous and more prosperous
than the neighboring despotic States. But it would have incurred the risk of
being conquered much oftener than they would in that lapse of years.
Self-Control Of The American Democracy
The American people acquiesces slowly, or frequently does not acquiesce, in
what is beneficial to its interests—The faults of the American democracy
are for the most part reparable.
The difficulty which a democracy has in conquering the passions and in subduing
the exigencies of the moment, with a view to the future, is conspicuous in the
most trivial occurrences of the United States. The people, which is surrounded
by flatterers, has great difficulty in surmounting its inclinations, and
whenever it is solicited to undergo a privation or any kind of inconvenience,
even to attain an end which is sanctioned by its own rational conviction, it
almost always refuses to comply at first. The deference of the Americans to the
laws has been very justly applauded; but it must be added that in America the
legislation is made by the people and for the people. Consequently, in the
United States the law favors those classes which are most interested in evading
it elsewhere. It may therefore be supposed that an offensive law, which should
not be acknowledged to be one of immediate utility, would either not be enacted
or would not be obeyed.
In America there is no law against fraudulent bankruptcies; not because they
are few, but because there are a great number of bankruptcies. The dread of
being prosecuted as a bankrupt acts with more intensity upon the mind of the
majority of the people than the fear of being involved in losses or ruin by the
failure of other parties, and a sort of guilty tolerance is extended by the
public conscience to an offence which everyone condemns in his individual
capacity. In the new States of the Southwest the citizens generally take
justice into their own hands, and murders are of very frequent occurrence. This
arises from the rude manners and the ignorance of the inhabitants of those
deserts, who do not perceive the utility of investing the law with adequate
force, and who prefer duels to prosecutions.
Someone observed to me one day, in Philadelphia, that almost all crimes in
America are caused by the abuse of intoxicating liquors, which the lower
classes can procure in great abundance, from their excessive cheapness.
“How comes it,” said I, “that you do not put a duty upon
brandy?” “Our legislators,” rejoined my informant,
“have frequently thought of this expedient; but the task of putting it in
operation is a difficult one; a revolt might be apprehended, and the members
who should vote for a law of this kind would be sure of losing their
seats.” “Whence I am to infer,” replied I, “that the
drinking population constitutes the majority in your country, and that
temperance is somewhat unpopular.”
When these things are pointed out to the American statesmen, they content
themselves with assuring you that time will operate the necessary change, and
that the experience of evil will teach the people its true interests. This is
frequently true, although a democracy is more liable to error than a monarch or
a body of nobles; the chances of its regaining the right path when once it has
acknowledged its mistake, are greater also; because it is rarely embarrassed by
internal interests, which conflict with those of the majority, and resist the
authority of reason. But a democracy can only obtain truth as the result of
experience, and many nations may forfeit their existence whilst they are
awaiting the consequences of their errors.
The great privilege of the Americans does not simply consist in their being
more enlightened than other nations, but in their being able to repair the
faults they may commit. To which it must be added, that a democracy cannot
derive substantial benefit from past experience, unless it be arrived at a
certain pitch of knowledge and civilization. There are tribes and peoples whose
education has been so vicious, and whose character presents so strange a
mixture of passion, of ignorance, and of erroneous notions upon all subjects,
that they are unable to discern the causes of their own wretchedness, and they
fall a sacrifice to ills with which they are unacquainted.
I have crossed vast tracts of country that were formerly inhabited by powerful
Indian nations which are now extinct; I have myself passed some time in the
midst of mutilated tribes, which witness the daily decline of their numerical
strength and of the glory of their independence; and I have heard these Indians
themselves anticipate the impending doom of their race. Every European can
perceive means which would rescue these unfortunate beings from inevitable
destruction. They alone are insensible to the expedient; they feel the woe
which year after year heaps upon their heads, but they will perish to a man
without accepting the remedy. It would be necessary to employ force to induce
them to submit to the protection and the constraint of civilization.
The incessant revolutions which have convulsed the South American provinces for
the last quarter of a century have frequently been adverted to with
astonishment, and expectations have been expressed that those nations would
speedily return to their natural state. But can it be affirmed that the turmoil
of revolution is not actually the most natural state of the South American
Spaniards at the present time? In that country society is plunged into
difficulties from which all its efforts are insufficient to rescue it. The
inhabitants of that fair portion of the Western Hemisphere seem obstinately
bent on pursuing the work of inward havoc. If they fall into a momentary repose
from the effects of exhaustion, that repose prepares them for a fresh state of
frenzy. When I consider their condition, which alternates between misery and
crime, I should be inclined to believe that despotism itself would be a benefit
to them, if it were possible that the words despotism and benefit could ever be
united in my mind.
Conduct Of Foreign Affairs By The American Democracy
Direction given to the foreign policy of the United States by Washington and
Jefferson—Almost all the defects inherent in democratic institutions are
brought to light in the conduct of foreign affairs—Their advantages are
less perceptible.
We have seen that the Federal Constitution entrusts the permanent direction of
the external interests of the nation to the President and the Senate, *r which
tends in some degree to detach the general foreign policy of the Union from the
control of the people. It cannot therefore be asserted with truth that the
external affairs of State are conducted by the democracy.
r 
[ “The President,” says the Constitution, Art. II, sect. 2, Section
2, “shall have power, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate,
to make treaties, provided two-thirds of the senators present concur.”
The reader is reminded that the senators are returned for a term of six years,
and that they are chosen by the legislature of each State.]
The policy of America owes its rise to Washington, and after him to Jefferson,
who established those principles which it observes at the present day.
Washington said in the admirable letter which he addressed to his
fellow-citizens, and which may be looked upon as his political bequest to the
country: “The great rule of conduct for us in regard to foreign nations
is, in extending our commercial relations, to have with them as little
political connection as possible. So far as we have already formed engagements,
let them be fulfilled with perfect good faith. Here let us stop. Europe has a
set of primary interests which to us have none, or a very remote relation.
Hence, she must be engaged in frequent controversies, the causes of which are
essentially foreign to our concerns. Hence, therefore, it must be unwise in us
to implicate ourselves, by artificial ties, in the ordinary vicissitudes of her
politics, or the ordinary combinations and collisions of her friendships or
enmities. Our detached and distant situation invites and enables us to pursue a
different course. If we remain one people, under an efficient government, the
period is not far off when we may defy material injury from external annoyance;
when we may take such an attitude as will cause the neutrality we may at any
time resolve upon to be scrupulously respected; when belligerent nations, under
the impossibility of making acquisitions upon us, will not lightly hazard the
giving us provocation; when we may choose peace or war, as our interest, guided
by justice, shall counsel. Why forego the advantages of so peculiar a
situation? Why quit our own to stand upon foreign ground? Why, by interweaving
our destiny with that of any part of Europe, entangle our peace and prosperity
in the toils of European ambition, rivalship, interest, humor, or caprice? It
is our true policy to steer clear of permanent alliances with any portion of
the foreign world; so far, I mean, as we are now at liberty to do it; for let
me not be understood as capable of patronizing infidelity to existing
engagements. I hold the maxim no less applicable to public than to private
affairs, that honesty is always the best policy. I repeat it; therefore, let
those engagements be observed in their genuine sense; but in my opinion it is
unnecessary, and would be unwise, to extend them. Taking care always to keep
ourselves, by suitable establishments, in a respectable defensive posture, we
may safely trust to temporary alliances for extraordinary emergencies.”
In a previous part of the same letter Washington makes the following admirable
and just remark: “The nation which indulges towards another an habitual
hatred or an habitual fondness is in some degree a slave. It is a slave to its
animosity or to its affection, either of which is sufficient to lead it astray
from its duty and its interest.”
The political conduct of Washington was always guided by these maxims. He
succeeded in maintaining his country in a state of peace whilst all the other
nations of the globe were at war; and he laid it down as a fundamental
doctrine, that the true interest of the Americans consisted in a perfect
neutrality with regard to the internal dissensions of the European Powers.
Jefferson went still further, and he introduced a maxim into the policy of the
Union, which affirms that “the Americans ought never to solicit any
privileges from foreign nations, in order not to be obliged to grant similar
privileges themselves.”
These two principles, which were so plain and so just as to be adapted to the
capacity of the populace, have greatly simplified the foreign policy of the
United States. As the Union takes no part in the affairs of Europe, it has,
properly speaking, no foreign interests to discuss, since it has at present no
powerful neighbors on the American continent. The country is as much removed
from the passions of the Old World by its position as by the line of policy
which it has chosen, and it is neither called upon to repudiate nor to espouse
the conflicting interests of Europe; whilst the dissensions of the New World
are still concealed within the bosom of the future.
The Union is free from all pre-existing obligations, and it is consequently
enabled to profit by the experience of the old nations of Europe, without being
obliged, as they are, to make the best of the past, and to adapt it to their
present circumstances; or to accept that immense inheritance which they derive
from their forefathers—an inheritance of glory mingled with calamities,
and of alliances conflicting with national antipathies. The foreign policy of
the United States is reduced by its very nature to await the chances of the
future history of the nation, and for the present it consists more in
abstaining from interference than in exerting its activity.
It is therefore very difficult to ascertain, at present, what degree of
sagacity the American democracy will display in the conduct of the foreign
policy of the country; and upon this point its adversaries, as well as its
advocates, must suspend their judgment. As for myself I have no hesitation in
avowing my conviction, that it is most especially in the conduct of foreign
relations that democratic governments appear to me to be decidedly inferior to
governments carried on upon different principles. Experience, instruction, and
habit may almost always succeed in creating a species of practical discretion
in democracies, and that science of the daily occurrences of life which is
called good sense. Good sense may suffice to direct the ordinary course of
society; and amongst a people whose education has been provided for, the
advantages of democratic liberty in the internal affairs of the country may
more than compensate for the evils inherent in a democratic government. But
such is not always the case in the mutual relations of foreign nations.
Foreign politics demand scarcely any of those qualities which a democracy
possesses; and they require, on the contrary, the perfect use of almost all
those faculties in which it is deficient. Democracy is favorable to the
increase of the internal resources of the State; it tends to diffuse a moderate
independence; it promotes the growth of public spirit, and fortifies the
respect which is entertained for law in all classes of society; and these are
advantages which only exercise an indirect influence over the relations which
one people bears to another. But a democracy is unable to regulate the details
of an important undertaking, to persevere in a design, and to work out its
execution in the presence of serious obstacles. It cannot combine its measures
with secrecy, and it will not await their consequences with patience. These are
qualities which more especially belong to an individual or to an aristocracy;
and they are precisely the means by which an individual people attains to a
predominant position.
If, on the contrary, we observe the natural defects of aristocracy, we shall
find that their influence is comparatively innoxious in the direction of the
external affairs of a State. The capital fault of which aristocratic bodies may
be accused is that they are more apt to contrive their own advantage than that
of the mass of the people. In foreign politics it is rare for the interest of
the aristocracy to be in any way distinct from that of the people.
The propensity which democracies have to obey the impulse of passion rather
than the suggestions of prudence, and to abandon a mature design for the
gratification of a momentary caprice, was very clearly seen in America on the
breaking out of the French Revolution. It was then as evident to the simplest
capacity as it is at the present time that the interest of the Americans
forbade them to take any part in the contest which was about to deluge Europe
with blood, but which could by no means injure the welfare of their own
country. Nevertheless the sympathies of the people declared themselves with so
much violence in behalf of France that nothing but the inflexible character of
Washington, and the immense popularity which he enjoyed, could have prevented
the Americans from declaring war against England. And even then, the exertions
which the austere reason of that great man made to repress the generous but
imprudent passions of his fellow-citizens, very nearly deprived him of the sole
recompense which he had ever claimed—that of his country’s love.
The majority then reprobated the line of policy which he adopted, and which has
since been unanimously approved by the nation. *s If the Constitution and the
favor of the public had not entrusted the direction of the foreign affairs of
the country to Washington, it is certain that the American nation would at that
time have taken the very measures which it now condemns.
s 
[ See the fifth volume of Marshall’s “Life of Washington.” In
a government constituted like that of the United States, he says, “it is
impossible for the chief magistrate, however firm he may be, to oppose for any
length of time the torrent of popular opinion; and the prevalent opinion of
that day seemed to incline to war. In fact, in the session of Congress held at
the time, it was frequently seen that Washington had lost the majority in the
House of Representatives.” The violence of the language used against him
in public was extreme, and in a political meeting they did not scruple to
compare him indirectly to the treacherous Arnold. “By the
opposition,” says Marshall, “the friends of the administration were
declared to be an aristocratic and corrupt faction, who, from a desire to
introduce monarchy, were hostile to France and under the influence of Britain;
that they were a paper nobility, whose extreme sensibility at every measure
which threatened the funds, induced a tame submission to injuries and insults,
which the interests and honor of the nation required them to resist.”]
Almost all the nations which have ever exercised a powerful influence upon the
destinies of the world by conceiving, following up, and executing vast
designs—from the Romans to the English—have been governed by
aristocratic institutions. Nor will this be a subject of wonder when we
recollect that nothing in the world has so absolute a fixity of purpose as an
aristocracy. The mass of the people may be led astray by ignorance or passion;
the mind of a king may be biased, and his perseverance in his designs may be
shaken—besides which a king is not immortal—but an aristocratic
body is too numerous to be led astray by the blandishments of intrigue, and yet
not numerous enough to yield readily to the intoxicating influence of
unreflecting passion: it has the energy of a firm and enlightened individual,
added to the power which it derives from perpetuity.
What The Real Advantages Are Which American Society Derives From The Government
Of The Democracy
Before I enter upon the subject of the present chapter I am induced to remind
the reader of what I have more than once adverted to in the course of this
book. The political institutions of the United States appear to me to be one of
the forms of government which a democracy may adopt; but I do not regard the
American Constitution as the best, or as the only one, which a democratic
people may establish. In showing the advantages which the Americans derive from
the government of democracy, I am therefore very far from meaning, or from
believing, that similar advantages can only be obtained from the same laws.
General Tendency Of The Laws Under The Rule Of The American Democracy, And
Habits Of Those Who Apply Them
Defects of a democratic government easy to be discovered—Its advantages
only to be discerned by long observation—Democracy in America often
inexpert, but the general tendency of the laws advantageous—In the
American democracy public officers have no permanent interests distinct from
those of the majority—Result of this state of things.
The defects and the weaknesses of a democratic government may very readily be
discovered; they are demonstrated by the most flagrant instances, whilst its
beneficial influence is less perceptibly exercised. A single glance suffices to
detect its evil consequences, but its good qualities can only be discerned by
long observation. The laws of the American democracy are frequently defective
or incomplete; they sometimes attack vested rights, or give a sanction to
others which are dangerous to the community; but even if they were good, the
frequent changes which they undergo would be an evil. How comes it, then, that
the American republics prosper and maintain their position?
In the consideration of laws a distinction must be carefully observed between
the end at which they aim and the means by which they are directed to that end,
between their absolute and their relative excellence. If it be the intention of
the legislator to favor the interests of the minority at the expense of the
majority, and if the measures he takes are so combined as to accomplish the
object he has in view with the least possible expense of time and exertion, the
law may be well drawn up, although its purpose be bad; and the more efficacious
it is, the greater is the mischief which it causes.
Democratic laws generally tend to promote the welfare of the greatest possible
number; for they emanate from the majority of the citizens, who are subject to
error, but who cannot have an interest opposed to their own advantage. The laws
of an aristocracy tend, on the contrary, to concentrate wealth and power in the
hands of the minority, because an aristocracy, by its very nature, constitutes
a minority. It may therefore be asserted, as a general proposition, that the
purpose of a democracy in the conduct of its legislation is useful to a greater
number of citizens than that of an aristocracy. This is, however, the sum total
of its advantages.
Aristocracies are infinitely more expert in the science of legislation than
democracies ever can be. They are possessed of a self-control which protects
them from the errors of temporary excitement, and they form lasting designs
which they mature with the assistance of favorable opportunities. Aristocratic
government proceeds with the dexterity of art; it understands how to make the
collective force of all its laws converge at the same time to a given point.
Such is not the case with democracies, whose laws are almost always ineffective
or inopportune. The means of democracy are therefore more imperfect than those
of aristocracy, and the measures which it unwittingly adopts are frequently
opposed to its own cause; but the object it has in view is more useful.
Let us now imagine a community so organized by nature, or by its constitution,
that it can support the transitory action of bad laws, and that it can await,
without destruction, the general tendency of the legislation: we shall then be
able to conceive that a democratic government, notwithstanding its defects,
will be most fitted to conduce to the prosperity of this community. This is
precisely what has occurred in the United States; and I repeat, what I have
before remarked, that the great advantage of the Americans consists in their
being able to commit faults which they may afterward repair.
An analogous observation may be made respecting public officers. It is easy to
perceive that the American democracy frequently errs in the choice of the
individuals to whom it entrusts the power of the administration; but it is more
difficult to say why the State prospers under their rule. In the first place it
is to be remarked, that if in a democratic State the governors have less
honesty and less capacity than elsewhere, the governed, on the other hand, are
more enlightened and more attentive to their interests. As the people in
democracies is more incessantly vigilant in its affairs and more jealous of its
rights, it prevents its representatives from abandoning that general line of
conduct which its own interest prescribes. In the second place, it must be
remembered that if the democratic magistrate is more apt to misuse his power,
he possesses it for a shorter period of time. But there is yet another reason
which is still more general and conclusive. It is no doubt of importance to the
welfare of nations that they should be governed by men of talents and virtue;
but it is perhaps still more important that the interests of those men should
not differ from the interests of the community at large; for, if such were the
case, virtues of a high order might become useless, and talents might be turned
to a bad account. I say that it is important that the interests of the persons
in authority should not conflict with or oppose the interests of the community
at large; but I do not insist upon their having the same interests as the whole
population, because I am not aware that such a state of things ever existed in
any country.
No political form has hitherto been discovered which is equally favorable to
the prosperity and the development of all the classes into which society is
divided. These classes continue to form, as it were, a certain number of
distinct nations in the same nation; and experience has shown that it is no
less dangerous to place the fate of these classes exclusively in the hands of
any one of them than it is to make one people the arbiter of the destiny of
another. When the rich alone govern, the interest of the poor is always
endangered; and when the poor make the laws, that of the rich incurs very
serious risks. The advantage of democracy does not consist, therefore, as has
sometimes been asserted, in favoring the prosperity of all, but simply in
contributing to the well-being of the greatest possible number.
The men who are entrusted with the direction of public affairs in the United
States are frequently inferior, both in point of capacity and of morality, to
those whom aristocratic institutions would raise to power. But their interest
is identified and confounded with that of the majority of their
fellow-citizens. They may frequently be faithless and frequently mistaken, but
they will never systematically adopt a line of conduct opposed to the will of
the majority; and it is impossible that they should give a dangerous or an
exclusive tendency to the government.
The mal-administration of a democratic magistrate is a mere isolated fact,
which only occurs during the short period for which he is elected. Corruption
and incapacity do not act as common interests, which may connect men
permanently with one another. A corrupt or an incapable magistrate will not
concert his measures with another magistrate, simply because that individual is
as corrupt and as incapable as himself; and these two men will never unite
their endeavors to promote the corruption and inaptitude of their remote
posterity. The ambition and the manoeuvres of the one will serve, on the
contrary, to unmask the other. The vices of a magistrate, in democratic states,
are usually peculiar to his own person.
But under aristocratic governments public men are swayed by the interest of
their order, which, if it is sometimes confounded with the interests of the
majority, is very frequently distinct from them. This interest is the common
and lasting bond which unites them together; it induces them to coalesce, and
to combine their efforts in order to attain an end which does not always ensure
the greatest happiness of the greatest number; and it serves not only to
connect the persons in authority, but to unite them to a considerable portion
of the community, since a numerous body of citizens belongs to the aristocracy,
without being invested with official functions. The aristocratic magistrate is
therefore constantly supported by a portion of the community, as well as by the
Government of which he is a member.
The common purpose which connects the interest of the magistrates in
aristocracies with that of a portion of their contemporaries identifies it with
that of future generations; their influence belongs to the future as much as to
the present. The aristocratic magistrate is urged at the same time toward the
same point by the passions of the community, by his own, and I may almost add
by those of his posterity. Is it, then, wonderful that he does not resist such
repeated impulses? And indeed aristocracies are often carried away by the
spirit of their order without being corrupted by it; and they unconsciously
fashion society to their own ends, and prepare it for their own descendants.
The English aristocracy is perhaps the most liberal which ever existed, and no
body of men has ever, uninterruptedly, furnished so many honorable and
enlightened individuals to the government of a country. It cannot, however,
escape observation that in the legislation of England the good of the poor has
been sacrificed to the advantage of the rich, and the rights of the majority to
the privileges of the few. The consequence is, that England, at the present
day, combines the extremes of fortune in the bosom of her society, and her
perils and calamities are almost equal to her power and her renown. *a
a 
[ [The legislation of England for the forty years is certainly not fairly open
to this criticism, which was written before the Reform Bill of 1832, and
accordingly Great Britain has thus far escaped and surmounted the perils and
calamities to which she seemed to be exposed.]]
In the United States, where the public officers have no interests to promote
connected with their caste, the general and constant influence of the
Government is beneficial, although the individuals who conduct it are
frequently unskilful and sometimes contemptible. There is indeed a secret
tendency in democratic institutions to render the exertions of the citizens
subservient to the prosperity of the community, notwithstanding their private
vices and mistakes; whilst in aristocratic institutions there is a secret
propensity which, notwithstanding the talents and the virtues of those who
conduct the government, leads them to contribute to the evils which oppress
their fellow-creatures. In aristocratic governments public men may frequently
do injuries which they do not intend, and in democratic states they produce
advantages which they never thought of.
Public Spirit In The United States
Patriotism of instinct—Patriotism of reflection—Their different
characteristics—Nations ought to strive to acquire the second when the
first has disappeared—Efforts of the Americans to it—Interest of
the individual intimately connected with that of the country.
There is one sort of patriotic attachment which principally arises from that
instinctive, disinterested, and undefinable feeling which connects the
affections of man with his birthplace. This natural fondness is united to a
taste for ancient customs, and to a reverence for ancestral traditions of the
past; those who cherish it love their country as they love the mansions of
their fathers. They enjoy the tranquillity which it affords them; they cling to
the peaceful habits which they have contracted within its bosom; they are
attached to the reminiscences which it awakens, and they are even pleased by
the state of obedience in which they are placed. This patriotism is sometimes
stimulated by religious enthusiasm, and then it is capable of making the most
prodigious efforts. It is in itself a kind of religion; it does not reason, but
it acts from the impulse of faith and of sentiment. By some nations the monarch
has been regarded as a personification of the country; and the fervor of
patriotism being converted into the fervor of loyalty, they took a sympathetic
pride in his conquests, and gloried in his power. At one time, under the
ancient monarchy, the French felt a sort of satisfaction in the sense of their
dependence upon the arbitrary pleasure of their king, and they were wont to say
with pride, “We are the subjects of the most powerful king in the
world.”
But, like all instinctive passions, this kind of patriotism is more apt to
prompt transient exertion than to supply the motives of continuous endeavor. It
may save the State in critical circumstances, but it will not unfrequently
allow the nation to decline in the midst of peace. Whilst the manners of a
people are simple and its faith unshaken, whilst society is steadily based upon
traditional institutions whose legitimacy has never been contested, this
instinctive patriotism is wont to endure.
But there is another species of attachment to a country which is more rational
than the one we have been describing. It is perhaps less generous and less
ardent, but it is more fruitful and more lasting; it is coeval with the spread
of knowledge, it is nurtured by the laws, it grows by the exercise of civil
rights, and, in the end, it is confounded with the personal interest of the
citizen. A man comprehends the influence which the prosperity of his country
has upon his own welfare; he is aware that the laws authorize him to contribute
his assistance to that prosperity, and he labors to promote it as a portion of
his interest in the first place, and as a portion of his right in the second.
But epochs sometimes occur, in the course of the existence of a nation, at
which the ancient customs of a people are changed, public morality destroyed,
religious belief disturbed, and the spell of tradition broken, whilst the
diffusion of knowledge is yet imperfect, and the civil rights of the community
are ill secured, or confined within very narrow limits. The country then
assumes a dim and dubious shape in the eyes of the citizens; they no longer
behold it in the soil which they inhabit, for that soil is to them a dull
inanimate clod; nor in the usages of their forefathers, which they have been
taught to look upon as a debasing yoke; nor in religion, for of that they
doubt; nor in the laws, which do not originate in their own authority; nor in
the legislator, whom they fear and despise. The country is lost to their
senses, they can neither discover it under its own nor under borrowed features,
and they entrench themselves within the dull precincts of a narrow egotism.
They are emancipated from prejudice without having acknowledged the empire of
reason; they are neither animated by the instinctive patriotism of monarchical
subjects nor by the thinking patriotism of republican citizens; but they have
stopped halfway between the two, in the midst of confusion and of distress.
In this predicament, to retreat is impossible; for a people cannot restore the
vivacity of its earlier times, any more than a man can return to the innocence
and the bloom of childhood; such things may be regretted, but they cannot be
renewed. The only thing, then, which remains to be done is to proceed, and to
accelerate the union of private with public interests, since the period of
disinterested patriotism is gone by forever.
I am certainly very far from averring that, in order to obtain this result, the
exercise of political rights should be immediately granted to all the members
of the community. But I maintain that the most powerful, and perhaps the only,
means of interesting men in the welfare of their country which we still possess
is to make them partakers in the Government. At the present time civic zeal
seems to me to be inseparable from the exercise of political rights; and I hold
that the number of citizens will be found to augment or to decrease in Europe
in proportion as those rights are extended.
In the United States the inhabitants were thrown but as yesterday upon the soil
which they now occupy, and they brought neither customs nor traditions with
them there; they meet each other for the first time with no previous
acquaintance; in short, the instinctive love of their country can scarcely
exist in their minds; but everyone takes as zealous an interest in the affairs
of his township, his county, and of the whole State, as if they were his own,
because everyone, in his sphere, takes an active part in the government of
society.
The lower orders in the United States are alive to the perception of the
influence exercised by the general prosperity upon their own welfare; and
simple as this observation is, it is one which is but too rarely made by the
people. But in America the people regards this prosperity as the result of its
own exertions; the citizen looks upon the fortune of the public as his private
interest, and he co-operates in its success, not so much from a sense of pride
or of duty, as from what I shall venture to term cupidity.
It is unnecessary to study the institutions and the history of the Americans in
order to discover the truth of this remark, for their manners render it
sufficiently evident. As the American participates in all that is done in his
country, he thinks himself obliged to defend whatever may be censured; for it
is not only his country which is attacked upon these occasions, but it is
himself. The consequence is, that his national pride resorts to a thousand
artifices, and to all the petty tricks of individual vanity.
Nothing is more embarrassing in the ordinary intercourse of life than this
irritable patriotism of the Americans. A stranger may be very well inclined to
praise many of the institutions of their country, but he begs permission to
blame some of the peculiarities which he observes—a permission which is,
however, inexorably refused. America is therefore a free country, in which,
lest anybody should be hurt by your remarks, you are not allowed to speak
freely of private individuals, or of the State, of the citizens or of the
authorities, of public or of private undertakings, or, in short, of anything at
all, except it be of the climate and the soil; and even then Americans will be
found ready to defend either the one or the other, as if they had been
contrived by the inhabitants of the country.
In our times option must be made between the patriotism of all and the
government of a few; for the force and activity which the first confers are
irreconcilable with the guarantees of tranquillity which the second furnishes.
Notion Of Rights In The United States
No great people without a notion of rights—How the notion of rights can
be given to people—Respect of rights in the United States—Whence it
arises.
After the idea of virtue, I know no higher principle than that of right; or, to
speak more accurately, these two ideas are commingled in one. The idea of right
is simply that of virtue introduced into the political world. It is the idea of
right which enabled men to define anarchy and tyranny; and which taught them to
remain independent without arrogance, as well as to obey without servility. The
man who submits to violence is debased by his compliance; but when he obeys the
mandate of one who possesses that right of authority which he acknowledges in a
fellow-creature, he rises in some measure above the person who delivers the
command. There are no great men without virtue, and there are no great
nations—it may almost be added that there would be no
society—without the notion of rights; for what is the condition of a mass
of rational and intelligent beings who are only united together by the bond of
force?
I am persuaded that the only means which we possess at the present time of
inculcating the notion of rights, and of rendering it, as it were, palpable to
the senses, is to invest all the members of the community with the peaceful
exercise of certain rights: this is very clearly seen in children, who are men
without the strength and the experience of manhood. When a child begins to move
in the midst of the objects which surround him, he is instinctively led to turn
everything which he can lay his hands upon to his own purposes; he has no
notion of the property of others; but as he gradually learns the value of
things, and begins to perceive that he may in his turn be deprived of his
possessions, he becomes more circumspect, and he observes those rights in
others which he wishes to have respected in himself. The principle which the
child derives from the possession of his toys is taught to the man by the
objects which he may call his own. In America those complaints against property
in general which are so frequent in Europe are never heard, because in America
there are no paupers; and as everyone has property of his own to defend,
everyone recognizes the principle upon which he holds it.
The same thing occurs in the political world. In America the lowest classes
have conceived a very high notion of political rights, because they exercise
those rights; and they refrain from attacking those of other people, in order
to ensure their own from attack. Whilst in Europe the same classes sometimes
recalcitrate even against the supreme power, the American submits without a
murmur to the authority of the pettiest magistrate.
This truth is exemplified by the most trivial details of national
peculiarities. In France very few pleasures are exclusively reserved for the
higher classes; the poor are admitted wherever the rich are received, and they
consequently behave with propriety, and respect whatever contributes to the
enjoyments in which they themselves participate. In England, where wealth has a
monopoly of amusement as well as of power, complaints are made that whenever
the poor happen to steal into the enclosures which are reserved for the
pleasures of the rich, they commit acts of wanton mischief: can this be
wondered at, since care has been taken that they should have nothing to lose?
*b
b 
[ [This, too, has been amended by much larger provisions for the amusements of
the people in public parks, gardens, museums, etc.; and the conduct of the
people in these places of amusement has improved in the same proportion.]]
The government of democracy brings the notion of political rights to the level
of the humblest citizens, just as the dissemination of wealth brings the notion
of property within the reach of all the members of the community; and I confess
that, to my mind, this is one of its greatest advantages. I do not assert that
it is easy to teach men to exercise political rights; but I maintain that, when
it is possible, the effects which result from it are highly important; and I
add that, if there ever was a time at which such an attempt ought to be made,
that time is our own. It is clear that the influence of religious belief is
shaken, and that the notion of divine rights is declining; it is evident that
public morality is vitiated, and the notion of moral rights is also
disappearing: these are general symptoms of the substitution of argument for
faith, and of calculation for the impulses of sentiment. If, in the midst of
this general disruption, you do not succeed in connecting the notion of rights
with that of personal interest, which is the only immutable point in the human
heart, what means will you have of governing the world except by fear? When I
am told that, since the laws are weak and the populace is wild, since passions
are excited and the authority of virtue is paralyzed, no measures must be taken
to increase the rights of the democracy, I reply, that it is for these very
reasons that some measures of the kind must be taken; and I am persuaded that
governments are still more interested in taking them than society at large,
because governments are liable to be destroyed and society cannot perish.
I am not, however, inclined to exaggerate the example which America furnishes.
In those States the people are invested with political rights at a time when
they could scarcely be abused, for the citizens were few in number and simple
in their manners. As they have increased, the Americans have not augmented the
power of the democracy, but they have, if I may use the expression, extended
its dominions. It cannot be doubted that the moment at which political rights
are granted to a people that had before been without them is a very critical,
though it be a necessary one. A child may kill before he is aware of the value
of life; and he may deprive another person of his property before he is aware
that his own may be taken away from him. The lower orders, when first they are
invested with political rights, stand, in relation to those rights, in the same
position as the child does to the whole of nature, and the celebrated adage may
then be applied to them, Homo puer robustus. This truth may even be perceived
in America. The States in which the citizens have enjoyed their rights longest
are those in which they make the best use of them.
It cannot be repeated too often that nothing is more fertile in prodigies than
the art of being free; but there is nothing more arduous than the
apprenticeship of liberty. Such is not the case with despotic institutions:
despotism often promises to make amends for a thousand previous ills; it
supports the right, it protects the oppressed, and it maintains public order.
The nation is lulled by the temporary prosperity which accrues to it, until it
is roused to a sense of its own misery. Liberty, on the contrary, is generally
established in the midst of agitation, it is perfected by civil discord, and
its benefits cannot be appreciated until it is already old.
Respect of the Americans for the law—Parental affection which they
entertain for it—Personal interest of everyone to increase the authority
of the law.
It is not always feasible to consult the whole people, either directly or
indirectly, in the formation of the law; but it cannot be denied that, when
such a measure is possible the authority of the law is very much augmented.
This popular origin, which impairs the excellence and the wisdom of
legislation, contributes prodigiously to increase its power. There is an
amazing strength in the expression of the determination of a whole people, and
when it declares itself the imagination of those who are most inclined to
contest it is overawed by its authority. The truth of this fact is very well
known by parties, and they consequently strive to make out a majority whenever
they can. If they have not the greater number of voters on their side, they
assert that the true majority abstained from voting; and if they are foiled
even there, they have recourse to the body of those persons who had no votes to
give.
In the United States, except slaves, servants, and paupers in the receipt of
relief from the townships, there is no class of persons who do not exercise the
elective franchise, and who do not indirectly contribute to make the laws.
Those who design to attack the laws must consequently either modify the opinion
of the nation or trample upon its decision.
A second reason, which is still more weighty, may be further adduced; in the
United States everyone is personally interested in enforcing the obedience of
the whole community to the law; for as the minority may shortly rally the
majority to its principles, it is interested in professing that respect for the
decrees of the legislator which it may soon have occasion to claim for its own.
However irksome an enactment may be, the citizen of the United States complies
with it, not only because it is the work of the majority, but because it
originates in his own authority, and he regards it as a contract to which he is
himself a party.
In the United States, then, that numerous and turbulent multitude does not
exist which always looks upon the law as its natural enemy, and accordingly
surveys it with fear and with fear and with distrust. It is impossible, on the
other hand, not to perceive that all classes display the utmost reliance upon
the legislation of their country, and that they are attached to it by a kind of
parental affection.
I am wrong, however, in saying all classes; for as in America the European
scale of authority is inverted, the wealthy are there placed in a position
analogous to that of the poor in the Old World, and it is the opulent classes
which frequently look upon the law with suspicion. I have already observed that
the advantage of democracy is not, as has been sometimes asserted, that it
protects the interests of the whole community, but simply that it protects
those of the majority. In the United States, where the poor rule, the rich have
always some reason to dread the abuses of their power. This natural anxiety of
the rich may produce a sullen dissatisfaction, but society is not disturbed by
it; for the same reason which induces the rich to withhold their confidence in
the legislative authority makes them obey its mandates; their wealth, which
prevents them from making the law, prevents them from withstanding it. Amongst
civilized nations revolts are rarely excited, except by such persons as have
nothing to lose by them; and if the laws of a democracy are not always worthy
of respect, at least they always obtain it; for those who usually infringe the
laws have no excuse for not complying with the enactments they have themselves
made, and by which they are themselves benefited, whilst the citizens whose
interests might be promoted by the infraction of them are induced, by their
character and their stations, to submit to the decisions of the legislature,
whatever they may be. Besides which, the people in America obeys the law not
only because it emanates from the popular authority, but because that authority
may modify it in any points which may prove vexatory; a law is observed because
it is a self-imposed evil in the first place, and an evil of transient duration
in the second.
Activity Which Pervades All The Branches Of The Body Politic In The United
States; Influence Which It Exercises Upon Society
More difficult to conceive the political activity which pervades the United
States than the freedom and equality which reign there—The great activity
which perpetually agitates the legislative bodies is only an episode to the
general activity—Difficult for an American to confine himself to his own
business—Political agitation extends to all social
intercourse—Commercial activity of the Americans partly attributable to
this cause—Indirect advantages which society derives from a democratic
government.
On passing from a country in which free institutions are established to one
where they do not exist, the traveller is struck by the change; in the former
all is bustle and activity, in the latter everything is calm and motionless. In
the one, amelioration and progress are the general topics of inquiry; in the
other, it seems as if the community only aspired to repose in the enjoyment of
the advantages which it has acquired. Nevertheless, the country which exerts
itself so strenuously to promote its welfare is generally more wealthy and more
prosperous than that which appears to be so contented with its lot; and when we
compare them together, we can scarcely conceive how so many new wants are daily
felt in the former, whilst so few seem to occur in the latter.
If this remark is applicable to those free countries in which monarchical and
aristocratic institutions subsist, it is still more striking with regard to
democratic republics. In these States it is not only a portion of the people
which is busied with the amelioration of its social condition, but the whole
community is engaged in the task; and it is not the exigencies and the
convenience of a single class for which a provision is to be made, but the
exigencies and the convenience of all ranks of life.
It is not impossible to conceive the surpassing liberty which the Americans
enjoy; some idea may likewise be formed of the extreme equality which subsists
amongst them, but the political activity which pervades the United States must
be seen in order to be understood. No sooner do you set foot upon the American
soil than you are stunned by a kind of tumult; a confused clamor is heard on
every side; and a thousand simultaneous voices demand the immediate
satisfaction of their social wants. Everything is in motion around you; here,
the people of one quarter of a town are met to decide upon the building of a
church; there, the election of a representative is going on; a little further
the delegates of a district are posting to the town in order to consult upon
some local improvements; or in another place the laborers of a village quit
their ploughs to deliberate upon the project of a road or a public school.
Meetings are called for the sole purpose of declaring their disapprobation of
the line of conduct pursued by the Government; whilst in other assemblies the
citizens salute the authorities of the day as the fathers of their country.
Societies are formed which regard drunkenness as the principal cause of the
evils under which the State labors, and which solemnly bind themselves to give
a constant example of temperance. *c
c 
[ At the time of my stay in the United States the temperance societies already
consisted of more than 270,000 members, and their effect had been to diminish
the consumption of fermented liquors by 500,000 gallons per annum in the State
of Pennsylvania alone.]
The great political agitation of the American legislative bodies, which is the
only kind of excitement that attracts the attention of foreign countries, is a
mere episode or a sort of continuation of that universal movement which
originates in the lowest classes of the people and extends successively to all
the ranks of society. It is impossible to spend more efforts in the pursuit of
enjoyment.
The cares of political life engross a most prominent place in the occupation of
a citizen in the United States, and almost the only pleasure of which an
American has any idea is to take a part in the Government, and to discuss the
part he has taken. This feeling pervades the most trifling habits of life; even
the women frequently attend public meetings and listen to political harangues
as a recreation after their household labors. Debating clubs are to a certain
extent a substitute for theatrical entertainments: an American cannot converse,
but he can discuss; and when he attempts to talk he falls into a dissertation.
He speaks to you as if he was addressing a meeting; and if he should chance to
warm in the course of the discussion, he will infallibly say,
“Gentlemen,” to the person with whom he is conversing.
In some countries the inhabitants display a certain repugnance to avail
themselves of the political privileges with which the law invests them; it
would seem that they set too high a value upon their time to spend it on the
interests of the community; and they prefer to withdraw within the exact limits
of a wholesome egotism, marked out by four sunk fences and a quickset hedge.
But if an American were condemned to confine his activity to his own affairs,
he would be robbed of one half of his existence; he would feel an immense void
in the life which he is accustomed to lead, and his wretchedness would be
unbearable. *d I am persuaded that, if ever a despotic government is
established in America, it will find it more difficult to surmount the habits
which free institutions have engendered than to conquer the attachment of the
citizens to freedom.
d 
[ The same remark was made at Rome under the first Caesars. Montesquieu
somewhere alludes to the excessive despondency of certain Roman citizens who,
after the excitement of political life, were all at once flung back into the
stagnation of private life.]
This ceaseless agitation which democratic government has introduced into the
political world influences all social intercourse. I am not sure that upon the
whole this is not the greatest advantage of democracy. And I am much less
inclined to applaud it for what it does than for what it causes to be done. It
is incontestable that the people frequently conducts public business very ill;
but it is impossible that the lower orders should take a part in public
business without extending the circle of their ideas, and without quitting the
ordinary routine of their mental acquirements. The humblest individual who is
called upon to co-operate in the government of society acquires a certain
degree of self-respect; and as he possesses authority, he can command the
services of minds much more enlightened than his own. He is canvassed by a
multitude of applicants, who seek to deceive him in a thousand different ways,
but who instruct him by their deceit. He takes a part in political undertakings
which did not originate in his own conception, but which give him a taste for
undertakings of the kind. New ameliorations are daily pointed out in the
property which he holds in common with others, and this gives him the desire of
improving that property which is more peculiarly his own. He is perhaps neither
happier nor better than those who came before him, but he is better informed
and more active. I have no doubt that the democratic institutions of the United
States, joined to the physical constitution of the country, are the cause (not
the direct, as is so often asserted, but the indirect cause) of the prodigious
commercial activity of the inhabitants. It is not engendered by the laws, but
the people learns how to promote it by the experience derived from legislation.
When the opponents of democracy assert that a single individual performs the
duties which he undertakes much better than the government of the community, it
appears to me that they are perfectly right. The government of an individual,
supposing an equality of instruction on either side, is more consistent, more
persevering, and more accurate than that of a multitude, and it is much better
qualified judiciously to discriminate the characters of the men it employs. If
any deny what I advance, they have certainly never seen a democratic
government, or have formed their opinion upon very partial evidence. It is true
that even when local circumstances and the disposition of the people allow
democratic institutions to subsist, they never display a regular and methodical
system of government. Democratic liberty is far from accomplishing all the
projects it undertakes, with the skill of an adroit despotism. It frequently
abandons them before they have borne their fruits, or risks them when the
consequences may prove dangerous; but in the end it produces more than any
absolute government, and if it do fewer things well, it does a greater number
of things. Under its sway the transactions of the public administration are not
nearly so important as what is done by private exertion. Democracy does not
confer the most skilful kind of government upon the people, but it produces
that which the most skilful governments are frequently unable to awaken,
namely, an all-pervading and restless activity, a superabundant force, and an
energy which is inseparable from it, and which may, under favorable
circumstances, beget the most amazing benefits. These are the true advantages
of democracy.
In the present age, when the destinies of Christendom seem to be in suspense,
some hasten to assail democracy as its foe whilst it is yet in its early
growth; and others are ready with their vows of adoration for this new deity
which is springing forth from chaos: but both parties are very imperfectly
acquainted with the object of their hatred or of their desires; they strike in
the dark, and distribute their blows by mere chance.
We must first understand what the purport of society and the aim of government
is held to be. If it be your intention to confer a certain elevation upon the
human mind, and to teach it to regard the things of this world with generous
feelings, to inspire men with a scorn of mere temporal advantage, to give birth
to living convictions, and to keep alive the spirit of honorable devotedness;
if you hold it to be a good thing to refine the habits, to embellish the
manners, to cultivate the arts of a nation, and to promote the love of poetry,
of beauty, and of renown; if you would constitute a people not unfitted to act
with power upon all other nations, nor unprepared for those high enterprises
which, whatever be the result of its efforts, will leave a name forever famous
in time—if you believe such to be the principal object of society, you
must avoid the government of democracy, which would be a very uncertain guide
to the end you have in view.
But if you hold it to be expedient to divert the moral and intellectual
activity of man to the production of comfort, and to the acquirement of the
necessaries of life; if a clear understanding be more profitable to man than
genius; if your object be not to stimulate the virtues of heroism, but to
create habits of peace; if you had rather witness vices than crimes and are
content to meet with fewer noble deeds, provided offences be diminished in the
same proportion; if, instead of living in the midst of a brilliant state of
society, you are contented to have prosperity around you; if, in short, you are
of opinion that the principal object of a Government is not to confer the
greatest possible share of power and of glory upon the body of the nation, but
to ensure the greatest degree of enjoyment and the least degree of misery to
each of the individuals who compose it—if such be your desires, you can
have no surer means of satisfying them than by equalizing the conditions of
men, and establishing democratic institutions.
But if the time be passed at which such a choice was possible, and if some
superhuman power impel us towards one or the other of these two governments
without consulting our wishes, let us at least endeavor to make the best of
that which is allotted to us; and let us so inquire into its good and its evil
propensities as to be able to foster the former and repress the latter to the
utmost.
Natural strength of the majority in democracies—Most of the American
Constitutions have increased this strength by artificial means—How this
has been done—Pledged delegates—Moral power of the
majority—Opinion as to its infallibility—Respect for its rights,
how augmented in the United States.
Unlimited Power Of The Majority In The United States, And Its Consequences
The very essence of democratic government consists in the absolute sovereignty
of the majority; for there is nothing in democratic States which is capable of
resisting it. Most of the American Constitutions have sought to increase this
natural strength of the majority by artificial means. *a
a 
[ We observed, in examining the Federal Constitution, that the efforts of the
legislators of the Union had been diametrically opposed to the present
tendency. The consequence has been that the Federal Government is more
independent in its sphere than that of the States. But the Federal Government
scarcely ever interferes in any but external affairs; and the governments of
the State are in the governments of the States are in reality the authorities
which direct society in America.]
The legislature is, of all political institutions, the one which is most easily
swayed by the wishes of the majority. The Americans determined that the members
of the legislature should be elected by the people immediately, and for a very
brief term, in order to subject them, not only to the general convictions, but
even to the daily passion, of their constituents. The members of both houses
are taken from the same class in society, and are nominated in the same manner;
so that the modifications of the legislative bodies are almost as rapid and
quite as irresistible as those of a single assembly. It is to a legislature
thus constituted that almost all the authority of the government has been
entrusted.
But whilst the law increased the strength of those authorities which of
themselves were strong, it enfeebled more and more those which were naturally
weak. It deprived the representatives of the executive of all stability and
independence, and by subjecting them completely to the caprices of the
legislature, it robbed them of the slender influence which the nature of a
democratic government might have allowed them to retain. In several States the
judicial power was also submitted to the elective discretion of the majority,
and in all of them its existence was made to depend on the pleasure of the
legislative authority, since the representatives were empowered annually to
regulate the stipend of the judges.
Custom, however, has done even more than law. A proceeding which will in the
end set all the guarantees of representative government at naught is becoming
more and more general in the United States; it frequently happens that the
electors, who choose a delegate, point out a certain line of conduct to him,
and impose upon him a certain number of positive obligations which he is
pledged to fulfil. With the exception of the tumult, this comes to the same
thing as if the majority of the populace held its deliberations in the
market-place.
Several other circumstances concur in rendering the power of the majority in
America not only preponderant, but irresistible. The moral authority of the
majority is partly based upon the notion that there is more intelligence and
more wisdom in a great number of men collected together than in a single
individual, and that the quantity of legislators is more important than their
quality. The theory of equality is in fact applied to the intellect of man: and
human pride is thus assailed in its last retreat by a doctrine which the
minority hesitate to admit, and in which they very slowly concur. Like all
other powers, and perhaps more than all other powers, the authority of the many
requires the sanction of time; at first it enforces obedience by constraint,
but its laws are not respected until they have long been maintained.
The right of governing society, which the majority supposes itself to derive
from its superior intelligence, was introduced into the United States by the
first settlers, and this idea, which would be sufficient of itself to create a
free nation, has now been amalgamated with the manners of the people and the
minor incidents of social intercourse.
The French, under the old monarchy, held it for a maxim (which is still a
fundamental principle of the English Constitution) that the King could do no
wrong; and if he did do wrong, the blame was imputed to his advisers. This
notion was highly favorable to habits of obedience, and it enabled the subject
to complain of the law without ceasing to love and honor the lawgiver. The
Americans entertain the same opinion with respect to the majority.
The moral power of the majority is founded upon yet another principle, which
is, that the interests of the many are to be preferred to those of the few. It
will readily be perceived that the respect here professed for the rights of the
majority must naturally increase or diminish according to the state of parties.
When a nation is divided into several irreconcilable factions, the privilege of
the majority is often overlooked, because it is intolerable to comply with its
demands.
If there existed in America a class of citizens whom the legislating majority
sought to deprive of exclusive privileges which they had possessed for ages,
and to bring down from an elevated station to the level of the ranks of the
multitude, it is probable that the minority would be less ready to comply with
its laws. But as the United States were colonized by men holding equal rank
amongst themselves, there is as yet no natural or permanent source of
dissension between the interests of its different inhabitants.
There are certain communities in which the persons who constitute the minority
can never hope to draw over the majority to their side, because they must then
give up the very point which is at issue between them. Thus, an aristocracy can
never become a majority whilst it retains its exclusive privileges, and it
cannot cede its privileges without ceasing to be an aristocracy.
In the United States political questions cannot be taken up in so general and
absolute a manner, and all parties are willing to recognize the right of the
majority, because they all hope to turn those rights to their own advantage at
some future time. The majority therefore in that country exercises a prodigious
actual authority, and a moral influence which is scarcely less preponderant; no
obstacles exist which can impede or so much as retard its progress, or which
can induce it to heed the complaints of those whom it crushes upon its path.
This state of things is fatal in itself and dangerous for the future.
How The Unlimited Power Of The Majority Increases In America The Instability Of
Legislation And Administration Inherent In Democracy The Americans increase the
mutability of the laws which is inherent in democracy by changing the
legislature every year, and by investing it with unbounded authority—The
same effect is produced upon the administration—In America social
amelioration is conducted more energetically but less perseveringly than in
Europe.
I have already spoken of the natural defects of democratic institutions, and
they all of them increase at the exact ratio of the power of the majority. To
begin with the most evident of them all; the mutability of the laws is an evil
inherent in democratic government, because it is natural to democracies to
raise men to power in very rapid succession. But this evil is more or less
sensible in proportion to the authority and the means of action which the
legislature possesses.
In America the authority exercised by the legislative bodies is supreme;
nothing prevents them from accomplishing their wishes with celerity, and with
irresistible power, whilst they are supplied by new representatives every year.
That is to say, the circumstances which contribute most powerfully to
democratic instability, and which admit of the free application of caprice to
every object in the State, are here in full operation. In conformity with this
principle, America is, at the present day, the country in the world where laws
last the shortest time. Almost all the American constitutions have been amended
within the course of thirty years: there is therefore not a single American
State which has not modified the principles of its legislation in that lapse of
time. As for the laws themselves, a single glance upon the archives of the
different States of the Union suffices to convince one that in America the
activity of the legislator never slackens. Not that the American democracy is
naturally less stable than any other, but that it is allowed to follow its
capricious propensities in the formation of the laws. *b
b 
[ The legislative acts promulgated by the State of Massachusetts alone, from
the year 1780 to the present time, already fill three stout volumes; and it
must not be forgotten that the collection to which I allude was published in
1823, when many old laws which had fallen into disuse were omitted. The State
of Massachusetts, which is not more populous than a department of France, may
be considered as the most stable, the most consistent, and the most sagacious
in its undertakings of the whole Union.]
The omnipotence of the majority, and the rapid as well as absolute manner in
which its decisions are executed in the United States, has not only the effect
of rendering the law unstable, but it exercises the same influence upon the
execution of the law and the conduct of the public administration. As the
majority is the only power which it is important to court, all its projects are
taken up with the greatest ardor, but no sooner is its attention distracted
than all this ardor ceases; whilst in the free States of Europe the
administration is at once independent and secure, so that the projects of the
legislature are put into execution, although its immediate attention may be
directed to other objects.
In America certain ameliorations are undertaken with much more zeal and
activity than elsewhere; in Europe the same ends are promoted by much less
social effort, more continuously applied.
Some years ago several pious individuals undertook to ameliorate the condition
of the prisons. The public was excited by the statements which they put
forward, and the regeneration of criminals became a very popular undertaking.
New prisons were built, and for the first time the idea of reforming as well as
of punishing the delinquent formed a part of prison discipline. But this happy
alteration, in which the public had taken so hearty an interest, and which the
exertions of the citizens had irresistibly accelerated, could not be completed
in a moment. Whilst the new penitentiaries were being erected (and it was the
pleasure of the majority that they should be terminated with all possible
celerity), the old prisons existed, which still contained a great number of
offenders. These jails became more unwholesome and more corrupt in proportion
as the new establishments were beautified and improved, forming a contrast
which may readily be understood. The majority was so eagerly employed in
founding the new prisons that those which already existed were forgotten; and
as the general attention was diverted to a novel object, the care which had
hitherto been bestowed upon the others ceased. The salutary regulations of
discipline were first relaxed, and afterwards broken; so that in the immediate
neighborhood of a prison which bore witness to the mild and enlightened spirit
of our time, dungeons might be met with which reminded the visitor of the
barbarity of the Middle Ages.
How the principle of the sovereignty of the people is to be
understood—Impossibility of conceiving a mixed government—The
sovereign power must centre somewhere—Precautions to be taken to control
its action—These precautions have not been taken in the United
States—Consequences.
I hold it to be an impious and an execrable maxim that, politically speaking, a
people has a right to do whatsoever it pleases, and yet I have asserted that
all authority originates in the will of the majority. Am I then, in
contradiction with myself?
A general law—which bears the name of Justice—has been made and
sanctioned, not only by a majority of this or that people, but by a majority of
mankind. The rights of every people are consequently confined within the limits
of what is just. A nation may be considered in the light of a jury which is
empowered to represent society at large, and to apply the great and general law
of justice. Ought such a jury, which represents society, to have more power
than the society in which the laws it applies originate?
When I refuse to obey an unjust law, I do not contest the right which the
majority has of commanding, but I simply appeal from the sovereignty of the
people to the sovereignty of mankind. It has been asserted that a people can
never entirely outstep the boundaries of justice and of reason in those affairs
which are more peculiarly its own, and that consequently, full power may
fearlessly be given to the majority by which it is represented. But this
language is that of a slave.
A majority taken collectively may be regarded as a being whose opinions, and
most frequently whose interests, are opposed to those of another being, which
is styled a minority. If it be admitted that a man, possessing absolute power,
may misuse that power by wronging his adversaries, why should a majority not be
liable to the same reproach? Men are not apt to change their characters by
agglomeration; nor does their patience in the presence of obstacles increase
with the consciousness of their strength. *c And for these reasons I can never
willingly invest any number of my fellow-creatures with that unlimited
authority which I should refuse to any one of them.
c 
[ No one will assert that a people cannot forcibly wrong another people; but
parties may be looked upon as lesser nations within a greater one, and they are
aliens to each other: if, therefore, it be admitted that a nation can act
tyrannically towards another nation, it cannot be denied that a party may do
the same towards another party.]
I do not think that it is possible to combine several principles in the same
government, so as at the same time to maintain freedom, and really to oppose
them to one another. The form of government which is usually termed mixed has
always appeared to me to be a mere chimera. Accurately speaking there is no
such thing as a mixed government (with the meaning usually given to that word),
because in all communities some one principle of action may be discovered which
preponderates over the others. England in the last century, which has been more
especially cited as an example of this form of Government, was in point of fact
an essentially aristocratic State, although it comprised very powerful elements
of democracy; for the laws and customs of the country were such that the
aristocracy could not but preponderate in the end, and subject the direction of
public affairs to its own will. The error arose from too much attention being
paid to the actual struggle which was going on between the nobles and the
people, without considering the probable issue of the contest, which was in
reality the important point. When a community really has a mixed government,
that is to say, when it is equally divided between two adverse principles, it
must either pass through a revolution or fall into complete dissolution.
I am therefore of opinion that some one social power must always be made to
predominate over the others; but I think that liberty is endangered when this
power is checked by no obstacles which may retard its course, and force it to
moderate its own vehemence.
Unlimited power is in itself a bad and dangerous thing; human beings are not
competent to exercise it with discretion, and God alone can be omnipotent,
because His wisdom and His justice are always equal to His power. But no power
upon earth is so worthy of honor for itself, or of reverential obedience to the
rights which it represents, that I would consent to admit its uncontrolled and
all-predominant authority. When I see that the right and the means of absolute
command are conferred on a people or upon a king, upon an aristocracy or a
democracy, a monarchy or a republic, I recognize the germ of tyranny, and I
journey onward to a land of more hopeful institutions.
In my opinion the main evil of the present democratic institutions of the
United States does not arise, as is often asserted in Europe, from their
weakness, but from their overpowering strength; and I am not so much alarmed at
the excessive liberty which reigns in that country as at the very inadequate
securities which exist against tyranny.
When an individual or a party is wronged in the United States, to whom can he
apply for redress? If to public opinion, public opinion constitutes the
majority; if to the legislature, it represents the majority, and implicitly
obeys its injunctions; if to the executive power, it is appointed by the
majority, and remains a passive tool in its hands; the public troops consist of
the majority under arms; the jury is the majority invested with the right of
hearing judicial cases; and in certain States even the judges are elected by
the majority. However iniquitous or absurd the evil of which you complain may
be, you must submit to it as well as you can. *d
d 
[ A striking instance of the excesses which may be occasioned by the despotism
of the majority occurred at Baltimore in the year 1812. At that time the war
was very popular in Baltimore. A journal which had taken the other side of the
question excited the indignation of the inhabitants by its opposition. The
populace assembled, broke the printing-presses, and attacked the houses of the
newspaper editors. The militia was called out, but no one obeyed the call; and
the only means of saving the poor wretches who were threatened by the frenzy of
the mob was to throw them into prison as common malefactors. But even this
precaution was ineffectual; the mob collected again during the night, the
magistrates again made a vain attempt to call out the militia, the prison was
forced, one of the newspaper editors was killed upon the spot, and the others
were left for dead; the guilty parties were acquitted by the jury when they
were brought to trial.
I said one day to an inhabitant of Pennsylvania, “Be so good as to
explain to me how it happens that in a State founded by Quakers, and celebrated
for its toleration, freed blacks are not allowed to exercise civil rights. They
pay the taxes; is it not fair that they should have a vote?”
“You insult us,” replied my informant, “if you imagine that
our legislators could have committed so gross an act of injustice and
intolerance.”
“What! then the blacks possess the right of voting in this county?”
“Without the smallest doubt.”
“How comes it, then, that at the polling-booth this morning I did not
perceive a single negro in the whole meeting?”
“This is not the fault of the law: the negroes have an undisputed right
of voting, but they voluntarily abstain from making their appearance.”
“A very pretty piece of modesty on their parts!” rejoined I.
“Why, the truth is, that they are not disinclined to vote, but they are
afraid of being maltreated; in this country the law is sometimes unable to
maintain its authority without the support of the majority. But in this case
the majority entertains very strong prejudices against the blacks, and the
magistrates are unable to protect them in the exercise of their legal
privileges.”
“What! then the majority claims the right not only of making the laws,
but of breaking the laws it has made?”]
If, on the other hand, a legislative power could be so constituted as to
represent the majority without necessarily being the slave of its passions; an
executive, so as to retain a certain degree of uncontrolled authority; and a
judiciary, so as to remain independent of the two other powers; a government
would be formed which would still be democratic without incurring any risk of
tyrannical abuse.
I do not say that tyrannical abuses frequently occur in America at the present
day, but I maintain that no sure barrier is established against them, and that
the causes which mitigate the government are to be found in the circumstances
and the manners of the country more than in its laws.
Effects Of The Unlimited Power Of The Majority Upon The Arbitrary Authority Of
The American Public Officers
Liberty left by the American laws to public officers within a certain
sphere—Their power.
A distinction must be drawn between tyranny and arbitrary power. Tyranny may be
exercised by means of the law, and in that case it is not arbitrary; arbitrary
power may be exercised for the good of the community at large, in which case it
is not tyrannical. Tyranny usually employs arbitrary means, but, if necessary,
it can rule without them.
In the United States the unbounded power of the majority, which is favorable to
the legal despotism of the legislature, is likewise favorable to the arbitrary
authority of the magistrate. The majority has an entire control over the law
when it is made and when it is executed; and as it possesses an equal authority
over those who are in power and the community at large, it considers public
officers as its passive agents, and readily confides the task of serving its
designs to their vigilance. The details of their office and the privileges
which they are to enjoy are rarely defined beforehand; but the majority treats
them as a master does his servants when they are always at work in his sight,
and he has the power of directing or reprimanding them at every instant.
In general the American functionaries are far more independent than the French
civil officers within the sphere which is prescribed to them. Sometimes, even,
they are allowed by the popular authority to exceed those bounds; and as they
are protected by the opinion, and backed by the co-operation, of the majority,
they venture upon such manifestations of their power as astonish a European. By
this means habits are formed in the heart of a free country which may some day
prove fatal to its liberties.
Power Exercised By The Majority In America Upon Opinion
In America, when the majority has once irrevocably decided a question, all
discussion ceases—Reason of this—Moral power exercised by the
majority upon opinion—Democratic republics have deprived despotism of its
physical instruments—Their despotism sways the minds of men.
It is in the examination of the display of public opinion in the United States
that we clearly perceive how far the power of the majority surpasses all the
powers with which we are acquainted in Europe. Intellectual principles exercise
an influence which is so invisible, and often so inappreciable, that they
baffle the toils of oppression. At the present time the most absolute monarchs
in Europe are unable to prevent certain notions, which are opposed to their
authority, from circulating in secret throughout their dominions, and even in
their courts. Such is not the case in America; as long as the majority is still
undecided, discussion is carried on; but as soon as its decision is irrevocably
pronounced, a submissive silence is observed, and the friends, as well as the
opponents, of the measure unite in assenting to its propriety. The reason of
this is perfectly clear: no monarch is so absolute as to combine all the powers
of society in his own hands, and to conquer all opposition with the energy of a
majority which is invested with the right of making and of executing the laws.
The authority of a king is purely physical, and it controls the actions of the
subject without subduing his private will; but the majority possesses a power
which is physical and moral at the same time; it acts upon the will as well as
upon the actions of men, and it represses not only all contest, but all
controversy. I know no country in which there is so little true independence of
mind and freedom of discussion as in America. In any constitutional state in
Europe every sort of religious and political theory may be advocated and
propagated abroad; for there is no country in Europe so subdued by any single
authority as not to contain citizens who are ready to protect the man who
raises his voice in the cause of truth from the consequences of his hardihood.
If he is unfortunate enough to live under an absolute government, the people is
upon his side; if he inhabits a free country, he may find a shelter behind the
authority of the throne, if he require one. The aristocratic part of society
supports him in some countries, and the democracy in others. But in a nation
where democratic institutions exist, organized like those of the United States,
there is but one sole authority, one single element of strength and of success,
with nothing beyond it.
In America the majority raises very formidable barriers to the liberty of
opinion: within these barriers an author may write whatever he pleases, but he
will repent it if he ever step beyond them. Not that he is exposed to the
terrors of an auto-da-fe, but he is tormented by the slights and persecutions
of daily obloquy. His political career is closed forever, since he has offended
the only authority which is able to promote his success. Every sort of
compensation, even that of celebrity, is refused to him. Before he published
his opinions he imagined that he held them in common with many others; but no
sooner has he declared them openly than he is loudly censured by his
overbearing opponents, whilst those who think without having the courage to
speak, like him, abandon him in silence. He yields at length, oppressed by the
daily efforts he has been making, and he subsides into silence, as if he was
tormented by remorse for having spoken the truth.
Fetters and headsmen were the coarse instruments which tyranny formerly
employed; but the civilization of our age has refined the arts of despotism
which seemed, however, to have been sufficiently perfected before. The excesses
of monarchical power had devised a variety of physical means of oppression: the
democratic republics of the present day have rendered it as entirely an affair
of the mind as that will which it is intended to coerce. Under the absolute
sway of an individual despot the body was attacked in order to subdue the soul,
and the soul escaped the blows which were directed against it and rose superior
to the attempt; but such is not the course adopted by tyranny in democratic
republics; there the body is left free, and the soul is enslaved. The sovereign
can no longer say, “You shall think as I do on pain of death;” but
he says, “You are free to think differently from me, and to retain your
life, your property, and all that you possess; but if such be your
determination, you are henceforth an alien among your people. You may retain
your civil rights, but they will be useless to you, for you will never be
chosen by your fellow-citizens if you solicit their suffrages, and they will
affect to scorn you if you solicit their esteem. You will remain among men, but
you will be deprived of the rights of mankind. Your fellow-creatures will shun
you like an impure being, and those who are most persuaded of your innocence
will abandon you too, lest they should be shunned in their turn. Go in peace! I
have given you your life, but it is an existence in comparably worse than
death.”
Monarchical institutions have thrown an odium upon despotism; let us beware
lest democratic republics should restore oppression, and should render it less
odious and less degrading in the eyes of the many, by making it still more
onerous to the few.
Works have been published in the proudest nations of the Old World expressly
intended to censure the vices and deride the follies of the times; Labruyere
inhabited the palace of Louis XIV when he composed his chapter upon the Great,
and Moliere criticised the courtiers in the very pieces which were acted before
the Court. But the ruling power in the United States is not to be made game of;
the smallest reproach irritates its sensibility, and the slightest joke which
has any foundation in truth renders it indignant; from the style of its
language to the more solid virtues of its character, everything must be made
the subject of encomium. No writer, whatever be his eminence, can escape from
this tribute of adulation to his fellow-citizens. The majority lives in the
perpetual practice of self-applause, and there are certain truths which the
Americans can only learn from strangers or from experience.
If great writers have not at present existed in America, the reason is very
simply given in these facts; there can be no literary genius without freedom of
opinion, and freedom of opinion does not exist in America. The Inquisition has
never been able to prevent a vast number of anti-religious books from
circulating in Spain. The empire of the majority succeeds much better in the
United States, since it actually removes the wish of publishing them.
Unbelievers are to be met with in America, but, to say the truth, there is no
public organ of infidelity. Attempts have been made by some governments to
protect the morality of nations by prohibiting licentious books. In the United
States no one is punished for this sort of works, but no one is induced to
write them; not because all the citizens are immaculate in their manners, but
because the majority of the community is decent and orderly.
In these cases the advantages derived from the exercise of this power are
unquestionable, and I am simply discussing the nature of the power itself. This
irresistible authority is a constant fact, and its judicious exercise is an
accidental occurrence.
Effects Of The Tyranny Of The Majority Upon The National Character Of The
Americans
Effects of the tyranny of the majority more sensibly felt hitherto in the
manners than in the conduct of society—They check the development of
leading characters—Democratic republics organized like the United States
bring the practice of courting favor within the reach of the many—Proofs
of this spirit in the United States—Why there is more patriotism in the
people than in those who govern in its name.
The tendencies which I have just alluded to are as yet very slightly
perceptible in political society, but they already begin to exercise an
unfavorable influence upon the national character of the Americans. I am
inclined to attribute the singular paucity of distinguished political
characters to the ever-increasing activity of the despotism of the majority in
the United States. When the American Revolution broke out they arose in great
numbers, for public opinion then served, not to tyrannize over, but to direct
the exertions of individuals. Those celebrated men took a full part in the
general agitation of mind common at that period, and they attained a high
degree of personal fame, which was reflected back upon the nation, but which
was by no means borrowed from it.
In absolute governments the great nobles who are nearest to the throne flatter
the passions of the sovereign, and voluntarily truckle to his caprices. But the
mass of the nation does not degrade itself by servitude: it often submits from
weakness, from habit, or from ignorance, and sometimes from loyalty. Some
nations have been known to sacrifice their own desires to those of the
sovereign with pleasure and with pride, thus exhibiting a sort of independence
in the very act of submission. These peoples are miserable, but they are not
degraded. There is a great difference between doing what one does not approve
and feigning to approve what one does; the one is the necessary case of a weak
person, the other befits the temper of a lackey.
In free countries, where everyone is more or less called upon to give his
opinion in the affairs of state; in democratic republics, where public life is
incessantly commingled with domestic affairs, where the sovereign authority is
accessible on every side, and where its attention can almost always be
attracted by vociferation, more persons are to be met with who speculate upon
its foibles and live at the cost of its passions than in absolute monarchies.
Not because men are naturally worse in these States than elsewhere, but the
temptation is stronger, and of easier access at the same time. The result is a
far more extensive debasement of the characters of citizens.
Democratic republics extend the practice of currying favor with the many, and
they introduce it into a greater number of classes at once: this is one of the
most serious reproaches that can be addressed to them. In democratic States
organized on the principles of the American republics, this is more especially
the case, where the authority of the majority is so absolute and so
irresistible that a man must give up his rights as a citizen, and almost abjure
his quality as a human being, if te intends to stray from the track which it
lays down.
In that immense crowd which throngs the avenues to power in the United States I
found very few men who displayed any of that manly candor and that masculine
independence of opinion which frequently distinguished the Americans in former
times, and which constitutes the leading feature in distinguished characters,
wheresoever they may be found. It seems, at first sight, as if all the minds of
the Americans were formed upon one model, so accurately do they correspond in
their manner of judging. A stranger does, indeed, sometimes meet with Americans
who dissent from these rigorous formularies; with men who deplore the defects
of the laws, the mutability and the ignorance of democracy; who even go so far
as to observe the evil tendencies which impair the national character, and to
point out such remedies as it might be possible to apply; but no one is there
to hear these things besides yourself, and you, to whom these secret
reflections are confided, are a stranger and a bird of passage. They are very
ready to communicate truths which are useless to you, but they continue to hold
a different language in public.
If ever these lines are read in America, I am well assured of two things: in
the first place, that all who peruse them will raise their voices to condemn
me; and in the second place, that very many of them will acquit me at the
bottom of their conscience.
I have heard of patriotism in the United States, and it is a virtue which may
be found among the people, but never among the leaders of the people. This may
be explained by analogy; despotism debases the oppressed much more than the
oppressor: in absolute monarchies the king has often great virtues, but the
courtiers are invariably servile. It is true that the American courtiers do not
say “Sire,” or “Your Majesty”—a distinction
without a difference. They are forever talking of the natural intelligence of
the populace they serve; they do not debate the question as to which of the
virtues of their master is pre-eminently worthy of admiration, for they assure
him that he possesses all the virtues under heaven without having acquired
them, or without caring to acquire them; they do not give him their daughters
and their wives to be raised at his pleasure to the rank of his concubines,
but, by sacrificing their opinions, they prostitute themselves. Moralists and
philosophers in America are not obliged to conceal their opinions under the
veil of allegory; but, before they venture upon a harsh truth, they say,
“We are aware that the people which we are addressing is too superior to
all the weaknesses of human nature to lose the command of its temper for an
instant; and we should not hold this language if we were not speaking to men
whom their virtues and their intelligence render more worthy of freedom than
all the rest of the world.” It would have been impossible for the
sycophants of Louis XIV to flatter more dexterously. For my part, I am
persuaded that in all governments, whatever their nature may be, servility will
cower to force, and adulation will cling to power. The only means of preventing
men from degrading themselves is to invest no one with that unlimited authority
which is the surest method of debasing them.
The Greatest Dangers Of The American Republics Proceed From The Unlimited Power
Of The Majority
Democratic republics liable to perish from a misuse of their power, and not by
impotence—The Governments of the American republics are more centralized
and more energetic than those of the monarchies of Europe—Dangers
resulting from this—Opinions of Hamilton and Jefferson upon this point.
Governments usually fall a sacrifice to impotence or to tyranny. In the former
case their power escapes from them; it is wrested from their grasp in the
latter. Many observers, who have witnessed the anarchy of democratic States,
have imagined that the government of those States was naturally weak and
impotent. The truth is, that when once hostilities are begun between parties,
the government loses its control over society. But I do not think that a
democratic power is naturally without force or without resources: say, rather,
that it is almost always by the abuse of its force and the misemployment of its
resources that a democratic government fails. Anarchy is almost always produced
by its tyranny or its mistakes, but not by its want of strength.
It is important not to confound stability with force, or the greatness of a
thing with its duration. In democratic republics, the power which directs *e
society is not stable; for it often changes hands and assumes a new direction.
But whichever way it turns, its force is almost irresistible. The Governments
of the American republics appear to me to be as much centralized as those of
the absolute monarchies of Europe, and more energetic than they are. I do not,
therefore, imagine that they will perish from weakness. *f
e 
[ This power may be centred in an assembly, in which case it will be strong
without being stable; or it may be centred in an individual, in which case it
will be less strong, but more stable.]
f 
[ I presume that it is scarcely necessary to remind the reader here, as well as
throughout the remainder of this chapter, that I am speaking, not of the
Federal Government, but of the several governments of each State, which the
majority controls at its pleasure.]
If ever the free institutions of America are destroyed, that event may be
attributed to the unlimited authority of the majority, which may at some future
time urge the minorities to desperation, and oblige them to have recourse to
physical force. Anarchy will then be the result, but it will have been brought
about by despotism.
Mr. Hamilton expresses the same opinion in the “Federalist,” No.
51. “It is of great importance in a republic not only to guard the
society against the oppression of its rulers, but to guard one part of the
society against the injustice of the other part. Justice is the end of
government. It is the end of civil society. It ever has been, and ever will be,
pursued until it be obtained, or until liberty be lost in the pursuit. In a
society, under the forms of which the stronger faction can readily unite and
oppress the weaker, anarchy may as truly be said to reign as in a state of
nature, where the weaker individual is not secured against the violence of the
stronger: and as in the latter state even the stronger individuals are prompted
by the uncertainty of their condition to submit to a government which may
protect the weak as well as themselves, so in the former state will the more
powerful factions be gradually induced by a like motive to wish for a
government which will protect all parties, the weaker as well as the more
powerful. It can be little doubted that, if the State of Rhode Island was
separated from the Confederacy and left to itself, the insecurity of right
under the popular form of government within such narrow limits would be
displayed by such reiterated oppressions of the factious majorities, that some
power altogether independent of the people would soon be called for by the
voice of the very factions whose misrule had proved the necessity of it.”
Jefferson has also thus expressed himself in a letter to Madison: *g “The
executive power in our Government is not the only, perhaps not even the
principal, object of my solicitude. The tyranny of the Legislature is really
the danger most to be feared, and will continue to be so for many years to
come. The tyranny of the executive power will come in its turn, but at a more
distant period.” I am glad to cite the opinion of Jefferson upon this
subject rather than that of another, because I consider him to be the most
powerful advocate democracy has ever sent forth.
g 
[ March 15, 1789.]
The national majority does not pretend to conduct all business—Is obliged
to employ the town and county magistrates to execute its supreme decisions.
I have already pointed out the distinction which is to be made between a
centralized government and a centralized administration. The former exists in
America, but the latter is nearly unknown there. If the directing power of the
American communities had both these instruments of government at its disposal,
and united the habit of executing its own commands to the right of commanding;
if, after having established the general principles of government, it descended
to the details of public business; and if, having regulated the great interests
of the country, it could penetrate into the privacy of individual interests,
freedom would soon be banished from the New World.
But in the United States the majority, which so frequently displays the tastes
and the propensities of a despot, is still destitute of the more perfect
instruments of tyranny. In the American republics the activity of the central
Government has never as yet been extended beyond a limited number of objects
sufficiently prominent to call forth its attention. The secondary affairs of
society have never been regulated by its authority, and nothing has hitherto
betrayed its desire of interfering in them. The majority is become more and
more absolute, but it has not increased the prerogatives of the central
government; those great prerogatives have been confined to a certain sphere;
and although the despotism of the majority may be galling upon one point, it
cannot be said to extend to all. However the predominant party in the nation
may be carried away by its passions, however ardent it may be in the pursuit of
its projects, it cannot oblige all the citizens to comply with its desires in
the same manner and at the same time throughout the country. When the central
Government which represents that majority has issued a decree, it must entrust
the execution of its will to agents, over whom it frequently has no control,
and whom it cannot perpetually direct. The townships, municipal bodies, and
counties may therefore be looked upon as concealed break-waters, which check or
part the tide of popular excitement. If an oppressive law were passed, the
liberties of the people would still be protected by the means by which that law
would be put in execution: the majority cannot descend to the details and (as I
will venture to style them) the puerilities of administrative tyranny. Nor does
the people entertain that full consciousness of its authority which would
prompt it to interfere in these matters; it knows the extent of its natural
powers, but it is unacquainted with the increased resources which the art of
government might furnish.
This point deserves attention, for if a democratic republic similar to that of
the United States were ever founded in a country where the power of a single
individual had previously subsisted, and the effects of a centralized
administration had sunk deep into the habits and the laws of the people, I do
not hesitate to assert, that in that country a more insufferable despotism
would prevail than any which now exists in the monarchical States of Europe, or
indeed than any which could be found on this side of the confines of Asia.
The Profession Of The Law In The United States Serves To Counterpoise The
Democracy
Utility of discriminating the natural propensities of the members of the legal
profession—These men called upon to act a prominent part in future
society—In what manner the peculiar pursuits of lawyers give an
aristocratic turn to their ideas—Accidental causes which may check this
tendency—Ease with which the aristocracy coalesces with legal
men—Use of lawyers to a despot—The profession of the law
constitutes the only aristocratic element with which the natural elements of
democracy will combine—Peculiar causes which tend to give an aristocratic
turn of mind to the English and American lawyers—The aristocracy of
America is on the bench and at the bar—Influence of lawyers upon American
society—Their peculiar magisterial habits affect the legislature, the
administration, and even the people.
In visiting the Americans and in studying their laws we perceive that the
authority they have entrusted to members of the legal profession, and the
influence which these individuals exercise in the Government, is the most
powerful existing security against the excesses of democracy. This effect seems
to me to result from a general cause which it is useful to investigate, since
it may produce analogous consequences elsewhere.
The members of the legal profession have taken an important part in all the
vicissitudes of political society in Europe during the last five hundred years.
At one time they have been the instruments of those who were invested with
political authority, and at another they have succeeded in converting political
authorities into their instrument. In the Middle Ages they afforded a powerful
support to the Crown, and since that period they have exerted themselves to the
utmost to limit the royal prerogative. In England they have contracted a close
alliance with the aristocracy; in France they have proved to be the most
dangerous enemies of that class. It is my object to inquire whether, under all
these circumstances, the members of the legal profession have been swayed by
sudden and momentary impulses; or whether they have been impelled by principles
which are inherent in their pursuits, and which will always recur in history. I
am incited to this investigation by reflecting that this particular class of
men will most likely play a prominent part in that order of things to which the
events of our time are giving birth.
Men who have more especially devoted themselves to legal pursuits derive from
those occupations certain habits of order, a taste for formalities, and a kind
of instinctive regard for the regular connection of ideas, which naturally
render them very hostile to the revolutionary spirit and the unreflecting
passions of the multitude.
The special information which lawyers derive from their studies ensures them a
separate station in society, and they constitute a sort of privileged body in
the scale of intelligence. This notion of their superiority perpetually recurs
to them in the practice of their profession: they are the masters of a science
which is necessary, but which is not very generally known; they serve as
arbiters between the citizens; and the habit of directing the blind passions of
parties in litigation to their purpose inspires them with a certain contempt
for the judgment of the multitude. To this it may be added that they naturally
constitute a body, not by any previous understanding, or by an agreement which
directs them to a common end; but the analogy of their studies and the
uniformity of their proceedings connect their minds together, as much as a
common interest could combine their endeavors.
A portion of the tastes and of the habits of the aristocracy may consequently
be discovered in the characters of men in the profession of the law. They
participate in the same instinctive love of order and of formalities; and they
entertain the same repugnance to the actions of the multitude, and the same
secret contempt of the government of the people. I do not mean to say that the
natural propensities of lawyers are sufficiently strong to sway them
irresistibly; for they, like most other men, are governed by their private
interests and the advantages of the moment.
In a state of society in which the members of the legal profession are
prevented from holding that rank in the political world which they enjoy in
private life, we may rest assured that they will be the foremost agents of
revolution. But it must then be inquired whether the cause which induces them
to innovate and to destroy is accidental, or whether it belongs to some lasting
purpose which they entertain. It is true that lawyers mainly contributed to the
overthrow of the French monarchy in 1789; but it remains to be seen whether
they acted thus because they had studied the laws, or because they were
prohibited from co-operating in the work of legislation.
Five hundred years ago the English nobles headed the people, and spoke in its
name; at the present time the aristocracy supports the throne, and defends the
royal prerogative. But aristocracy has, notwithstanding this, its peculiar
instincts and propensities. We must be careful not to confound isolated members
of a body with the body itself. In all free governments, of whatsoever form
they may be, members of the legal profession will be found at the head of all
parties. The same remark is also applicable to the aristocracy; for almost all
the democratic convulsions which have agitated the world have been directed by
nobles.
A privileged body can never satisfy the ambition of all its members; it has
always more talents and more passions to content and to employ than it can find
places; so that a considerable number of individuals are usually to be met with
who are inclined to attack those very privileges which they find it impossible
to turn to their own account.
I do not, then, assert that all the members of the legal profession are at all
times the friends of order and the opponents of innovation, but merely that
most of them usually are so. In a community in which lawyers are allowed to
occupy, without opposition, that high station which naturally belongs to them,
their general spirit will be eminently conservative and anti-democratic. When
an aristocracy excludes the leaders of that profession from its ranks, it
excites enemies which are the more formidable to its security as they are
independent of the nobility by their industrious pursuits; and they feel
themselves to be its equal in point of intelligence, although they enjoy less
opulence and less power. But whenever an aristocracy consents to impart some of
its privileges to these same individuals, the two classes coalesce very
readily, and assume, as it were, the consistency of a single order of family
interests.
I am, in like manner, inclined to believe that a monarch will always be able to
convert legal practitioners into the most serviceable instruments of his
authority. There is a far greater affinity between this class of individuals
and the executive power than there is between them and the people; just as
there is a greater natural affinity between the nobles and the monarch than
between the nobles and the people, although the higher orders of society have
occasionally resisted the prerogative of the Crown in concert with the lower
classes.
Lawyers are attached to public order beyond every other consideration, and the
best security of public order is authority. It must not be forgotten that, if
they prize the free institutions of their country much, they nevertheless value
the legality of those institutions far more: they are less afraid of tyranny
than of arbitrary power; and provided that the legislature take upon itself to
deprive men of their independence, they are not dissatisfied.
I am therefore convinced that the prince who, in presence of an encroaching
democracy, should endeavor to impair the judicial authority in his dominions,
and to diminish the political influence of lawyers, would commit a great
mistake. He would let slip the substance of authority to grasp at the shadow.
He would act more wisely in introducing men connected with the law into the
government; and if he entrusted them with the conduct of a despotic power,
bearing some marks of violence, that power would most likely assume the
external features of justice and of legality in their hands.
The government of democracy is favorable to the political power of lawyers; for
when the wealthy, the noble, and the prince are excluded from the government,
they are sure to occupy the highest stations, in their own right, as it were,
since they are the only men of information and sagacity, beyond the sphere of
the people, who can be the object of the popular choice. If, then, they are led
by their tastes to combine with the aristocracy and to support the Crown, they
are naturally brought into contact with the people by their interests. They
like the government of democracy, without participating in its propensities and
without imitating its weaknesses; whence they derive a twofold authority, from
it and over it. The people in democratic states does not mistrust the members
of the legal profession, because it is well known that they are interested in
serving the popular cause; and it listens to them without irritation, because
it does not attribute to them any sinister designs. The object of lawyers is
not, indeed, to overthrow the institutions of democracy, but they constantly
endeavor to give it an impulse which diverts it from its real tendency, by
means which are foreign to its nature. Lawyers belong to the people by birth
and interest, to the aristocracy by habit and by taste, and they may be looked
upon as the natural bond and connecting link of the two great classes of
society.
The profession of the law is the only aristocratic element which can be
amalgamated without violence with the natural elements of democracy, and which
can be advantageously and permanently combined with them. I am not unacquainted
with the defects which are inherent in the character of that body of men; but
without this admixture of lawyer-like sobriety with the democratic principle, I
question whether democratic institutions could long be maintained, and I cannot
believe that a republic could subsist at the present time if the influence of
lawyers in public business did not increase in proportion to the power of the
people.
This aristocratic character, which I hold to be common to the legal profession,
is much more distinctly marked in the United States and in England than in any
other country. This proceeds not only from the legal studies of the English and
American lawyers, but from the nature of the legislation, and the position
which those persons occupy in the two countries. The English and the Americans
have retained the law of precedents; that is to say, they continue to found
their legal opinions and the decisions of their courts upon the opinions and
the decisions of their forefathers. In the mind of an English or American
lawyer a taste and a reverence for what is old is almost always united to a
love of regular and lawful proceedings.
This predisposition has another effect upon the character of the legal
profession and upon the general course of society. The English and American
lawyers investigate what has been done; the French advocate inquires what
should have been done; the former produce precedents, the latter reasons. A
French observer is surprised to hear how often an English or an American lawyer
quotes the opinions of others, and how little he alludes to his own; whilst the
reverse occurs in France. There the most trifling litigation is never conducted
without the introduction of an entire system of ideas peculiar to the counsel
employed; and the fundamental principles of law are discussed in order to
obtain a perch of land by the decision of the court. This abnegation of his own
opinion, and this implicit deference to the opinion of his forefathers, which
are common to the English and American lawyer, this subjection of thought which
he is obliged to profess, necessarily give him more timid habits and more
sluggish inclinations in England and America than in France.
The French codes are often difficult of comprehension, but they can be read by
every one; nothing, on the other hand, can be more impenetrable to the
uninitiated than a legislation founded upon precedents. The indispensable want
of legal assistance which is felt in England and in the United States, and the
high opinion which is generally entertained of the ability of the legal
profession, tend to separate it more and more from the people, and to place it
in a distinct class. The French lawyer is simply a man extensively acquainted
with the statutes of his country; but the English or American lawyer resembles
the hierophants of Egypt, for, like them, he is the sole interpreter of an
occult science.
The station which lawyers occupy in England and America exercises no less an
influence upon their habits and their opinions. The English aristocracy, which
has taken care to attract to its sphere whatever is at all analogous to itself,
has conferred a high degree of importance and of authority upon the members of
the legal profession. In English society lawyers do not occupy the first rank,
but they are contented with the station assigned to them; they constitute, as
it were, the younger branch of the English aristocracy, and they are attached
to their elder brothers, although they do not enjoy all their privileges. The
English lawyers consequently mingle the taste and the ideas of the aristocratic
circles in which they move with the aristocratic interests of their profession.
And indeed the lawyer-like character which I am endeavoring to depict is most
distinctly to be met with in England: there laws are esteemed not so much
because they are good as because they are old; and if it be necessary to modify
them in any respect, or to adapt them the changes which time operates in
society, recourse is had to the most inconceivable contrivances in order to
uphold the traditionary fabric, and to maintain that nothing has been done
which does not square with the intentions and complete the labors of former
generations. The very individuals who conduct these changes disclaim all
intention of innovation, and they had rather resort to absurd expedients than
plead guilty to so great a crime. This spirit appertains more especially to the
English lawyers; they seem indifferent to the real meaning of what they treat,
and they direct all their attention to the letter, seeming inclined to infringe
the rules of common sense and of humanity rather than to swerve one title from
the law. The English legislation may be compared to the stock of an old tree,
upon which lawyers have engrafted the most various shoots, with the hope that,
although their fruits may differ, their foliage at least will be confounded
with the venerable trunk which supports them all.
In America there are no nobles or men of letters, and the people is apt to
mistrust the wealthy; lawyers consequently form the highest political class,
and the most cultivated circle of society. They have therefore nothing to gain
by innovation, which adds a conservative interest to their natural taste for
public order. If I were asked where I place the American aristocracy, I should
reply without hesitation that it is not composed of the rich, who are united
together by no common tie, but that it occupies the judicial bench and the bar.
The more we reflect upon all that occurs in the United States the more shall we
be persuaded that the lawyers as a body form the most powerful, if not the
only, counterpoise to the democratic element. In that country we perceive how
eminently the legal profession is qualified by its powers, and even by its
defects, to neutralize the vices which are inherent in popular government. When
the American people is intoxicated by passion, or carried away by the
impetuosity of its ideas, it is checked and stopped by the almost invisible
influence of its legal counsellors, who secretly oppose their aristocratic
propensities to its democratic instincts, their superstitious attachment to
what is antique to its love of novelty, their narrow views to its immense
designs, and their habitual procrastination to its ardent impatience.
The courts of justice are the most visible organs by which the legal profession
is enabled to control the democracy. The judge is a lawyer, who, independently
of the taste for regularity and order which he has contracted in the study of
legislation, derives an additional love of stability from his own inalienable
functions. His legal attainments have already raised him to a distinguished
rank amongst his fellow-citizens; his political power completes the distinction
of his station, and gives him the inclinations natural to privileged classes.
Armed with the power of declaring the laws to be unconstitutional, *a the
American magistrate perpetually interferes in political affairs. He cannot
force the people to make laws, but at least he can oblige it not to disobey its
own enactments; or to act inconsistently with its own principles. I am aware
that a secret tendency to diminish the judicial power exists in the United
States, and by most of the constitutions of the several States the Government
can, upon the demand of the two houses of the legislature, remove the judges
from their station. By some other constitutions the members of the tribunals
are elected, and they are even subjected to frequent re-elections. I venture to
predict that these innovations will sooner or later be attended with fatal
consequences, and that it will be found out at some future period that the
attack which is made upon the judicial power has affected the democratic
republic itself.
a 
[ See chapter VI. on the “Judicial Power in the United States.”]
It must not, however, be supposed that the legal spirit of which I have been
speaking has been confined, in the United States, to the courts of justice; it
extends far beyond them. As the lawyers constitute the only enlightened class
which the people does not mistrust, they are naturally called upon to occupy
most of the public stations. They fill the legislative assemblies, and they
conduct the administration; they consequently exercise a powerful influence
upon the formation of the law, and upon its execution. The lawyers are,
however, obliged to yield to the current of public opinion, which is too strong
for them to resist it, but it is easy to find indications of what their conduct
would be if they were free to act as they chose. The Americans, who have made
such copious innovations in their political legislation, have introduced very
sparing alterations in their civil laws, and that with great difficulty,
although those laws are frequently repugnant to their social condition. The
reason of this is, that in matters of civil law the majority is obliged to
defer to the authority of the legal profession, and that the American lawyers
are disinclined to innovate when they are left to their own choice.
It is curious for a Frenchman, accustomed to a very different state of things,
to hear the perpetual complaints which are made in the United States against
the stationary propensities of legal men, and their prejudices in favor of
existing institutions.
The influence of the legal habits which are common in America extends beyond
the limits I have just pointed out. Scarcely any question arises in the United
States which does not become, sooner or later, a subject of judicial debate;
hence all parties are obliged to borrow the ideas, and even the language, usual
in judicial proceedings in their daily controversies. As most public men are,
or have been, legal practitioners, they introduce the customs and
technicalities of their profession into the affairs of the country. The jury
extends this habitude to all classes. The language of the law thus becomes, in
some measure, a vulgar tongue; the spirit of the law, which is produced in the
schools and courts of justice, gradually penetrates beyond their walls into the
bosom of society, where it descends to the lowest classes, so that the whole
people contracts the habits and the tastes of the magistrate. The lawyers of
the United States form a party which is but little feared and scarcely
perceived, which has no badge peculiar to itself, which adapts itself with
great flexibility to the exigencies of the time, and accommodates itself to all
the movements of the social body; but this party extends over the whole
community, and it penetrates into all classes of society; it acts upon the
country imperceptibly, but it finally fashions it to suit its purposes.
Trial by jury, which is one of the instruments of the sovereignty of the
people, deserves to be compared with the other laws which establish that
sovereignty—Composition of the jury in the United States—Effect of
trial by jury upon the national character—It educates the people—It
tends to establish the authority of the magistrates and to extend a knowledge
of law among the people.
Since I have been led by my subject to recur to the administration of justice
in the United States, I will not pass over this point without adverting to the
institution of the jury. Trial by jury may be considered in two separate points
of view, as a judicial and as a political institution. If it entered into my
present purpose to inquire how far trial by jury (more especially in civil
cases) contributes to insure the best administration of justice, I admit that
its utility might be contested. As the jury was first introduced at a time when
society was in an uncivilized state, and when courts of justice were merely
called upon to decide on the evidence of facts, it is not an easy task to adapt
it to the wants of a highly civilized community when the mutual relations of
men are multiplied to a surprising extent, and have assumed the enlightened and
intellectual character of the age. *b
b 
[ The investigation of trial by jury as a judicial institution, and the
appreciation of its effects in the United States, together with the advantages
the Americans have derived from it, would suffice to form a book, and a book
upon a very useful and curious subject. The State of Louisiana would in
particular afford the curious phenomenon of a French and English legislation,
as well as a French and English population, which are gradually combining with
each other. See the “Digeste des Lois de la Louisiane,” in two
volumes; and the “Traite sur les Regles des Actions civiles,”
printed in French and English at New Orleans in 1830.]
My present object is to consider the jury as a political institution, and any
other course would divert me from my subject. Of trial by jury, considered as a
judicial institution, I shall here say but very few words. When the English
adopted trial by jury they were a semi-barbarous people; they are become, in
course of time, one of the most enlightened nations of the earth; and their
attachment to this institution seems to have increased with their increasing
cultivation. They soon spread beyond their insular boundaries to every corner
of the habitable globe; some have formed colonies, others independent states;
the mother-country has maintained its monarchical constitution; many of its
offspring have founded powerful republics; but wherever the English have been
they have boasted of the privilege of trial by jury. *c They have established
it, or hastened to re-establish it, in all their settlements. A judicial
institution which obtains the suffrages of a great people for so long a series
of ages, which is zealously renewed at every epoch of civilization, in all the
climates of the earth and under every form of human government, cannot be
contrary to the spirit of justice. *d
c 
[ All the English and American jurists are unanimous upon this head. Mr. Story,
judge of the Supreme Court of the United States, speaks, in his “Treatise
on the Federal Constitution,” of the advantages of trial by jury in civil
cases:—“The inestimable privilege of a trial by jury in civil
cases—a privilege scarcely inferior to that in criminal cases, which is
counted by all persons to be essential to political and civil liberty. . .
.” (Story, book iii., chap. xxxviii.)]
d 
[ If it were our province to point out the utility of the jury as a judicial
institution in this place, much might be said, and the following arguments
might be brought forward amongst others:—
By introducing the jury into the business of the courts you are enabled to
diminish the number of judges, which is a very great advantage. When judges are
very numerous, death is perpetually thinning the ranks of the judicial
functionaries, and laying places vacant for newcomers. The ambition of the
magistrates is therefore continually excited, and they are naturally made
dependent upon the will of the majority, or the individual who fills up the
vacant appointments; the officers of the court then rise like the officers of
an army. This state of things is entirely contrary to the sound administration
of justice, and to the intentions of the legislator. The office of a judge is
made inalienable in order that he may remain independent: but of what advantage
is it that his independence should be protected if he be tempted to sacrifice
it of his own accord? When judges are very numerous many of them must
necessarily be incapable of performing their important duties, for a great
magistrate is a man of no common powers; and I am inclined to believe that a
half-enlightened tribunal is the worst of all instruments for attaining those
objects which it is the purpose of courts of justice to accomplish. For my own
part, I had rather submit the decision of a case to ignorant jurors directed by
a skilful judge than to judges a majority of whom are imperfectly acquainted
with jurisprudence and with the laws.]
I turn, however, from this part of the subject. To look upon the jury as a mere
judicial institution is to confine our attention to a very narrow view of it;
for however great its influence may be upon the decisions of the law courts,
that influence is very subordinate to the powerful effects which it produces on
the destinies of the community at large. The jury is above all a political
institution, and it must be regarded in this light in order to be duly
appreciated.
By the jury I mean a certain number of citizens chosen indiscriminately, and
invested with a temporary right of judging. Trial by jury, as applied to the
repression of crime, appears to me to introduce an eminently republican element
into the government upon the following grounds:—
The institution of the jury may be aristocratic or democratic, according to the
class of society from which the jurors are selected; but it always preserves
its republican character, inasmuch as it places the real direction of society
in the hands of the governed, or of a portion of the governed, instead of
leaving it under the authority of the Government. Force is never more than a
transient element of success; and after force comes the notion of right. A
government which should only be able to crush its enemies upon a field of
battle would very soon be destroyed. The true sanction of political laws is to
be found in penal legislation, and if that sanction be wanting the law will
sooner or later lose its cogency. He who punishes infractions of the law is
therefore the real master of society. Now the institution of the jury raises
the people itself, or at least a class of citizens, to the bench of judicial
authority. The institution of the jury consequently invests the people, or that
class of citizens, with the direction of society. *e
e 
[ An important remark must, however, be made. Trial by jury does unquestionably
invest the people with a general control over the actions of citizens, but it
does not furnish means of exercising this control in all cases, or with an
absolute authority. When an absolute monarch has the right of trying offences
by his representatives, the fate of the prisoner is, as it were, decided
beforehand. But even if the people were predisposed to convict, the composition
and the non-responsibility of the jury would still afford some chances
favorable to the protection of innocence.]
In England the jury is returned from the aristocratic portion of the nation; *f
the aristocracy makes the laws, applies the laws, and punishes all infractions
of the laws; everything is established upon a consistent footing, and England
may with truth be said to constitute an aristocratic republic. In the United
States the same system is applied to the whole people. Every American citizen
is qualified to be an elector, a juror, and is eligible to office. *g The
system of the jury, as it is understood in America, appears to me to be as
direct and as extreme a consequence of the sovereignty of the people as
universal suffrage. These institutions are two instruments of equal power,
which contribute to the supremacy of the majority. All the sovereigns who have
chosen to govern by their own authority, and to direct society instead of
obeying its directions, have destroyed or enfeebled the institution of the
jury. The monarchs of the House of Tudor sent to prison jurors who refused to
convict, and Napoleon caused them to be returned by his agents.
f 
[ [This may be true to some extent of special juries, but not of common juries.
The author seems not to have been aware that the qualifications of jurors in
England vary exceedingly.]]
g 
[ See Appendix, Q.]
However clear most of these truths may seem to be, they do not command
universal assent, and in France, at least, the institution of trial by jury is
still very imperfectly understood. If the question arises as to the proper
qualification of jurors, it is confined to a discussion of the intelligence and
knowledge of the citizens who may be returned, as if the jury was merely a
judicial institution. This appears to me to be the least part of the subject.
The jury is pre-eminently a political institution; it must be regarded as one
form of the sovereignty of the people; when that sovereignty is repudiated, it
must be rejected, or it must be adapted to the laws by which that sovereignty
is established. The jury is that portion of the nation to which the execution
of the laws is entrusted, as the Houses of Parliament constitute that part of
the nation which makes the laws; and in order that society may be governed with
consistency and uniformity, the list of citizens qualified to serve on juries
must increase and diminish with the list of electors. This I hold to be the
point of view most worthy of the attention of the legislator, and all that
remains is merely accessory.
I am so entirely convinced that the jury is pre-eminently a political
institution that I still consider it in this light when it is applied in civil
causes. Laws are always unstable unless they are founded upon the manners of a
nation; manners are the only durable and resisting power in a people. When the
jury is reserved for criminal offences, the people only witnesses its
occasional action in certain particular cases; the ordinary course of life goes
on without its interference, and it is considered as an instrument, but not as
the only instrument, of obtaining justice. This is true a fortiori when the
jury is only applied to certain criminal causes.
When, on the contrary, the influence of the jury is extended to civil causes,
its application is constantly palpable; it affects all the interests of the
community; everyone co-operates in its work: it thus penetrates into all the
usages of life, it fashions the human mind to its peculiar forms, and is
gradually associated with the idea of justice itself.
The institution of the jury, if confined to criminal causes, is always in
danger, but when once it is introduced into civil proceedings it defies the
aggressions of time and of man. If it had been as easy to remove the jury from
the manners as from the laws of England, it would have perished under Henry
VIII, and Elizabeth, and the civil jury did in reality, at that period, save
the liberties of the country. In whatever manner the jury be applied, it cannot
fail to exercise a powerful influence upon the national character; but this
influence is prodigiously increased when it is introduced into civil causes.
The jury, and more especially the jury in civil cases, serves to communicate
the spirit of the judges to the minds of all the citizens; and this spirit,
with the habits which attend it, is the soundest preparation for free
institutions. It imbues all classes with a respect for the thing judged, and
with the notion of right. If these two elements be removed, the love of
independence is reduced to a mere destructive passion. It teaches men to
practice equity, every man learns to judge his neighbor as he would himself be
judged; and this is especially true of the jury in civil causes, for, whilst
the number of persons who have reason to apprehend a criminal prosecution is
small, every one is liable to have a civil action brought against him. The jury
teaches every man not to recoil before the responsibility of his own actions,
and impresses him with that manly confidence without which political virtue
cannot exist. It invests each citizen with a kind of magistracy, it makes them
all feel the duties which they are bound to discharge towards society, and the
part which they take in the Government. By obliging men to turn their attention
to affairs which are not exclusively their own, it rubs off that individual
egotism which is the rust of society.
The jury contributes most powerfully to form the judgement and to increase the
natural intelligence of a people, and this is, in my opinion, its greatest
advantage. It may be regarded as a gratuitous public school ever open, in which
every juror learns to exercise his rights, enters into daily communication with
the most learned and enlightened members of the upper classes, and becomes
practically acquainted with the laws of his country, which are brought within
the reach of his capacity by the efforts of the bar, the advice of the judge,
and even by the passions of the parties. I think that the practical
intelligence and political good sense of the Americans are mainly attributable
to the long use which they have made of the jury in civil causes. I do not know
whether the jury is useful to those who are in litigation; but I am certain it
is highly beneficial to those who decide the litigation; and I look upon it as
one of the most efficacious means for the education of the people which society
can employ.
What I have hitherto said applies to all nations, but the remark I am now about
to make is peculiar to the Americans and to democratic peoples. I have already
observed that in democracies the members of the legal profession and the
magistrates constitute the only aristocratic body which can check the
irregularities of the people. This aristocracy is invested with no physical
power, but it exercises its conservative influence upon the minds of men, and
the most abundant source of its authority is the institution of the civil jury.
In criminal causes, when society is armed against a single individual, the jury
is apt to look upon the judge as the passive instrument of social power, and to
mistrust his advice. Moreover, criminal causes are entirely founded upon the
evidence of facts which common sense can readily appreciate; upon this ground
the judge and the jury are equal. Such, however, is not the case in civil
causes; then the judge appears as a disinterested arbiter between the
conflicting passions of the parties. The jurors look up to him with confidence
and listen to him with respect, for in this instance their intelligence is
completely under the control of his learning. It is the judge who sums up the
various arguments with which their memory has been wearied out, and who guides
them through the devious course of the proceedings; he points their attention
to the exact question of fact which they are called upon to solve, and he puts
the answer to the question of law into their mouths. His influence upon their
verdict is almost unlimited.
If I am called upon to explain why I am but little moved by the arguments
derived from the ignorance of jurors in civil causes, I reply, that in these
proceedings, whenever the question to be solved is not a mere question of fact,
the jury has only the semblance of a judicial body. The jury sanctions the
decision of the judge, they by the authority of society which they represent,
and he by that of reason and of law. *h
h 
[ See Appendix, R.]
In England and in America the judges exercise an influence upon criminal trials
which the French judges have never possessed. The reason of this difference may
easily be discovered; the English and American magistrates establish their
authority in civil causes, and only transfer it afterwards to tribunals of
another kind, where that authority was not acquired. In some cases (and they
are frequently the most important ones) the American judges have the right of
deciding causes alone. *i Upon these occasions they are accidentally placed in
the position which the French judges habitually occupy, but they are invested
with far more power than the latter; they are still surrounded by the
reminiscence of the jury, and their judgment has almost as much authority as
the voice of the community at large, represented by that institution. Their
influence extends beyond the limits of the courts; in the recreations of
private life as well as in the turmoil of public business, abroad and in the
legislative assemblies, the American judge is constantly surrounded by men who
are accustomed to regard his intelligence as superior to their own, and after
having exercised his power in the decision of causes, he continues to influence
the habits of thought and the characters of the individuals who took a part in
his judgment.
i 
[ The Federal judges decide upon their own authority almost all the questions
most important to the country.]
The jury, then, which seems to restrict the rights of magistracy, does in
reality consolidate its power, and in no country are the judges so powerful as
there, where the people partakes their privileges. It is more especially by
means of the jury in civil causes that the American magistrates imbue all
classes of society with the spirit of their profession. Thus the jury, which is
the most energetic means of making the people rule, is also the most
efficacious means of teaching it to rule well.
Principal Causes Which Tend To Maintain The Democratic Republic In The United
States
A democratic republic subsists in the United States, and the principal object
of this book has been to account for the fact of its existence. Several of the
causes which contribute to maintain the institutions of America have been
involuntarily passed by or only hinted at as I was borne along by my subject.
Others I have been unable to discuss, and those on which I have dwelt most are,
as it were, buried in the details of the former parts of this work. I think,
therefore, that before I proceed to speak of the future, I cannot do better
than collect within a small compass the reasons which best explain the present.
In this retrospective chapter I shall be succinct, for I shall take care to
remind the reader very summarily of what he already knows; and I shall only
select the most prominent of those facts which I have not yet pointed out.
All the causes which contribute to the maintenance of the democratic republic
in the United States are reducible to three heads:—
I. The peculiar and accidental situation in which Providence has placed the
Americans.
II. The laws.
III. The manners and customs of the people.
Accidental Or Providential Causes Which Contribute To The Maintenance Of The
Democratic Republic In The United States The Union has no neighbors—No
metropolis—The Americans have had the chances of birth in their
favor—America an empty country—How this circumstance contributes
powerfully to the maintenance of the democratic republic in America—How
the American wilds are peopled—Avidity of the Anglo-Americans in taking
possession of the solitudes of the New World—Influence of physical
prosperity upon the political opinions of the Americans.
A thousand circumstances, independent of the will of man, concur to facilitate
the maintenance of a democratic republic in the United States. Some of these
peculiarities are known, the others may easily be pointed out; but I shall
confine myself to the most prominent amongst them.
The Americans have no neighbors, and consequently they have no great wars, or
financial crises, or inroads, or conquest to dread; they require neither great
taxes, nor great armies, nor great generals; and they have nothing to fear from
a scourge which is more formidable to republics than all these evils combined,
namely, military glory. It is impossible to deny the inconceivable influence
which military glory exercises upon the spirit of a nation. General Jackson,
whom the Americans have twice elected to the head of their Government, is a man
of a violent temper and mediocre talents; no one circumstance in the whole
course of his career ever proved that he is qualified to govern a free people,
and indeed the majority of the enlightened classes of the Union has always been
opposed to him. But he was raised to the Presidency, and has been maintained in
that lofty station, solely by the recollection of a victory which he gained
twenty years ago under the walls of New Orleans, a victory which was, however,
a very ordinary achievement, and which could only be remembered in a country
where battles are rare. Now the people which is thus carried away by the
illusions of glory is unquestionably the most cold and calculating, the most
unmilitary (if I may use the expression), and the most prosaic of all the
peoples of the earth.
America has no great capital *a city, whose influence is directly or indirectly
felt over the whole extent of the country, which I hold to be one of the first
causes of the maintenance of republican institutions in the United States. In
cities men cannot be prevented from concerting together, and from awakening a
mutual excitement which prompts sudden and passionate resolutions. Cities may
be looked upon as large assemblies, of which all the inhabitants are members;
their populace exercises a prodigious influence upon the magistrates, and
frequently executes its own wishes without their intervention.
a 
[ The United States have no metropolis, but they already contain several very
large cities. Philadelphia reckoned 161,000 inhabitants and New York 202,000 in
the year 1830. The lower orders which inhabit these cities constitute a rabble
even more formidable than the populace of European towns. They consist of freed
blacks in the first place, who are condemned by the laws and by public opinion
to a hereditary state of misery and degradation. They also contain a multitude
of Europeans who have been driven to the shores of the New World by their
misfortunes or their misconduct; and these men inoculate the United States with
all our vices, without bringing with them any of those interests which
counteract their baneful influence. As inhabitants of a country where they have
no civil rights, they are ready to turn all the passions which agitate the
community to their own advantage; thus, within the last few months serious
riots have broken out in Philadelphia and in New York. Disturbances of this
kind are unknown in the rest of the country, which is nowise alarmed by them,
because the population of the cities has hitherto exercised neither power nor
influence over the rural districts. Nevertheless, I look upon the size of
certain American cities, and especially on the nature of their population, as a
real danger which threatens the future security of the democratic republics of
the New World; and I venture to predict that they will perish from this
circumstance unless the government succeeds in creating an armed force, which,
whilst it remains under the control of the majority of the nation, will be
independent of the town population, and able to repress its excesses.
[The population of the city of New York had risen, in 1870, to 942,292, and
that of Philadelphia to 674,022. Brooklyn, which may be said to form part of
New York city, has a population of 396,099, in addition to that of New York.
The frequent disturbances in the great cities of America, and the excessive
corruption of their local governments—over which there is no effectual
control—are amongst the greatest evils and dangers of the country.]]
To subject the provinces to the metropolis is therefore not only to place the
destiny of the empire in the hands of a portion of the community, which may be
reprobated as unjust, but to place it in the hands of a populace acting under
its own impulses, which must be avoided as dangerous. The preponderance of
capital cities is therefore a serious blow upon the representative system, and
it exposes modern republics to the same defect as the republics of antiquity,
which all perished from not having been acquainted with that form of
government.
It would be easy for me to adduce a great number of secondary causes which have
contributed to establish, and which concur to maintain, the democratic republic
of the United States. But I discern two principal circumstances amongst these
favorable elements, which I hasten to point out. I have already observed that
the origin of the American settlements may be looked upon as the first and most
efficacious cause to which the present prosperity of the United States may be
attributed. The Americans had the chances of birth in their favor, and their
forefathers imported that equality of conditions into the country whence the
democratic republic has very naturally taken its rise. Nor was this all they
did; for besides this republican condition of society, the early settler
bequeathed to their descendants those customs, manners, and opinions which
contribute most to the success of a republican form of government. When I
reflect upon the consequences of this primary circumstance, methinks I see the
destiny of America embodied in the first Puritan who landed on those shores,
just as the human race was represented by the first man.
The chief circumstance which has favored the establishment and the maintenance
of a democratic republic in the United States is the nature of the territory
which the American inhabit. Their ancestors gave them the love of equality and
of freedom, but God himself gave them the means of remaining equal and free, by
placing them upon a boundless continent, which is open to their exertions.
General prosperity is favorable to the stability of all governments, but more
particularly of a democratic constitution, which depends upon the dispositions
of the majority, and more particularly of that portion of the community which
is most exposed to feel the pressure of want. When the people rules, it must be
rendered happy, or it will overturn the State, and misery is apt to stimulate
it to those excesses to which ambition rouses kings. The physical causes,
independent of the laws, which contribute to promote general prosperity, are
more numerous in America than they have ever been in any other country in the
world, at any other period of history. In the United States not only is
legislation democratic, but nature herself favors the cause of the people.
In what part of human tradition can be found anything at all similar to that
which is occurring under our eyes in North America? The celebrated communities
of antiquity were all founded in the midst of hostile nations, which they were
obliged to subjugate before they could flourish in their place. Even the
moderns have found, in some parts of South America, vast regions inhabited by a
people of inferior civilization, but which occupied and cultivated the soil. To
found their new states it was necessary to extirpate or to subdue a numerous
population, until civilization has been made to blush for their success. But
North America was only inhabited by wandering tribes, who took no thought of
the natural riches of the soil, and that vast country was still, properly
speaking, an empty continent, a desert land awaiting its inhabitants.
Everything is extraordinary in America, the social condition of the
inhabitants, as well as the laws; but the soil upon which these institutions
are founded is more extraordinary than all the rest. When man was first placed
upon the earth by the Creator, the earth was inexhaustible in its youth, but
man was weak and ignorant; and when he had learned to explore the treasures
which it contained, hosts of his fellow creatures covered its surface, and he
was obliged to earn an asylum for repose and for freedom by the sword. At that
same period North America was discovered, as if it had been kept in reserve by
the Deity, and had just risen from beneath the waters of the deluge.
That continent still presents, as it did in the primeval time, rivers which
rise from never-failing sources, green and moist solitudes, and fields which
the ploughshare of the husbandman has never turned. In this state it is offered
to man, not in the barbarous and isolated condition of the early ages, but to a
being who is already in possession of the most potent secrets of the natural
world, who is united to his fellow-men, and instructed by the experience of
fifty centuries. At this very time thirteen millions of civilized Europeans are
peaceably spreading over those fertile plains, with whose resources and whose
extent they are not yet themselves accurately acquainted. Three or four
thousand soldiers drive the wandering races of the aborigines before them;
these are followed by the pioneers, who pierce the woods, scare off the beasts
of prey, explore the courses of the inland streams, and make ready the
triumphal procession of civilization across the waste.
The favorable influence of the temporal prosperity of America upon the
institutions of that country has been so often described by others, and
adverted to by myself, that I shall not enlarge upon it beyond the addition of
a few facts. An erroneous notion is generally entertained that the deserts of
America are peopled by European emigrants, who annually disembark upon the
coasts of the New World, whilst the American population increases and
multiplies upon the soil which its forefathers tilled. The European settler,
however, usually arrives in the United States without friends, and sometimes
without resources; in order to subsist he is obliged to work for hire, and he
rarely proceeds beyond that belt of industrious population which adjoins the
ocean. The desert cannot be explored without capital or credit; and the body
must be accustomed to the rigors of a new climate before it can be exposed to
the chances of forest life. It is the Americans themselves who daily quit the
spots which gave them birth to acquire extensive domains in a remote country.
Thus the European leaves his cottage for the trans-Atlantic shores; and the
American, who is born on that very coast, plunges in his turn into the wilds of
Central America. This double emigration is incessant; it begins in the remotest
parts of Europe, it crosses the Atlantic Ocean, and it advances over the
solitudes of the New World. Millions of men are marching at once towards the
same horizon; their language, their religion, their manners differ, their
object is the same. The gifts of fortune are promised in the West, and to the
West they bend their course. *b

[ [The number of foreign immigrants into the United States in the last fifty
years (from 1820 to 1871) is stated to be 7,556,007. Of these, 4,104,553 spoke
English—that is, they came from Great Britain, Ireland, or the British
colonies; 2,643,069 came from Germany or northern Europe; and about half a
million from the south of Europe.]]
No event can be compared with this continuous removal of the human race, except
perhaps those irruptions which preceded the fall of the Roman Empire. Then, as
well as now, generations of men were impelled forwards in the same direction to
meet and struggle on the same spot; but the designs of Providence were not the
same; then, every newcomer was the harbinger of destruction and of death; now,
every adventurer brings with him the elements of prosperity and of life. The
future still conceals from us the ulterior consequences of this emigration of
the Americans towards the West; but we can readily apprehend its more immediate
results. As a portion of the inhabitants annually leave the States in which
they were born, the population of these States increases very slowly, although
they have long been established: thus in Connecticut, which only contains
fifty-nine inhabitants to the square mile, the population has not increased by
more than one-quarter in forty years, whilst that of England has been augmented
by one-third in the lapse of the same period. The European emigrant always
lands, therefore, in a country which is but half full, and where hands are in
request: he becomes a workman in easy circumstances; his son goes to seek his
fortune in unpeopled regions, and he becomes a rich landowner. The former
amasses the capital which the latter invests, and the stranger as well as the
native is unacquainted with want.
The laws of the United States are extremely favorable to the division of
property; but a cause which is more powerful than the laws prevents property
from being divided to excess. *c This is very perceptible in the States which
are beginning to be thickly peopled; Massachusetts is the most populous part of
the Union, but it contains only eighty inhabitants to the square mile, which is
must less than in France, where 162 are reckoned to the same extent of country.
But in Massachusetts estates are very rarely divided; the eldest son takes the
land, and the others go to seek their fortune in the desert. The law has
abolished the rights of primogeniture, but circumstances have concurred to
re-establish it under a form of which none can complain, and by which no just
rights are impaired.
c 
[ In New England the estates are exceedingly small, but they are rarely
subjected to further division.]
A single fact will suffice to show the prodigious number of individuals who
leave New England, in this manner, to settle themselves in the wilds. We were
assured in 1830 that thirty-six of the members of Congress were born in the
little State of Connecticut. The population of Connecticut, which constitutes
only one forty-third part of that of the United States, thus furnished
one-eighth of the whole body of representatives. The States of Connecticut,
however, only sends five delegates to Congress; and the thirty-one others sit
for the new Western States. If these thirty-one individuals had remained in
Connecticut, it is probable that instead of becoming rich landowners they would
have remained humble laborers, that they would have lived in obscurity without
being able to rise into public life, and that, far from becoming useful members
of the legislature, they might have been unruly citizens.
These reflections do not escape the observation of the Americans any more than
of ourselves. “It cannot be doubted,” says Chancellor Kent in his
“Treatise on American Law,” “that the division of landed
estates must produce great evils when it is carried to such excess as that each
parcel of land is insufficient to support a family; but these disadvantages
have never been felt in the United States, and many generations must elapse
before they can be felt. The extent of our inhabited territory, the abundance
of adjacent land, and the continual stream of emigration flowing from the
shores of the Atlantic towards the interior of the country, suffice as yet, and
will long suffice, to prevent the parcelling out of estates.”
It is difficult to describe the rapacity with which the American rushes forward
to secure the immense booty which fortune proffers to him. In the pursuit he
fearlessly braves the arrow of the Indian and the distempers of the forest; he
is unimpressed by the silence of the woods; the approach of beasts of prey does
not disturb him; for he is goaded onwards by a passion more intense than the
love of life. Before him lies a boundless continent, and he urges onwards as if
time pressed, and he was afraid of finding no room for his exertions. I have
spoken of the emigration from the older States, but how shall I describe that
which takes place from the more recent ones? Fifty years have scarcely elapsed
since that of Ohio was founded; the greater part of its inhabitants were not
born within its confines; its capital has only been built thirty years, and its
territory is still covered by an immense extent of uncultivated fields;
nevertheless the population of Ohio is already proceeding westward, and most of
the settlers who descend to the fertile savannahs of Illinois are citizens of
Ohio. These men left their first country to improve their condition; they quit
their resting-place to ameliorate it still more; fortune awaits them
everywhere, but happiness they cannot attain. The desire of prosperity is
become an ardent and restless passion in their minds which grows by what it
gains. They early broke the ties which bound them to their natal earth, and
they have contracted no fresh ones on their way. Emigration was at first
necessary to them as a means of subsistence; and it soon becomes a sort of game
of chance, which they pursue for the emotions it excites as much as for the
gain it procures.
Sometimes the progress of man is so rapid that the desert reappears behind him.
The woods stoop to give him a passage, and spring up again when he has passed.
It is not uncommon in crossing the new States of the West to meet with deserted
dwellings in the midst of the wilds; the traveller frequently discovers the
vestiges of a log house in the most solitary retreats, which bear witness to
the power, and no less to the inconstancy of man. In these abandoned fields,
and over these ruins of a day, the primeval forest soon scatters a fresh
vegetation, the beasts resume the haunts which were once their own, and Nature
covers the traces of man’s path with branches and with flowers, which
obliterate his evanescent track.
I remember that, in crossing one of the woodland districts which still cover
the State of New York, I reached the shores of a lake embosomed in forests
coeval with the world. A small island, covered with woods whose thick foliage
concealed its banks, rose from the centre of the waters. Upon the shores of the
lake no object attested the presence of man except a column of smoke which
might be seen on the horizon rising from the tops of the trees to the clouds,
and seeming to hang from heaven rather than to be mounting to the sky. An
Indian shallop was hauled up on the sand, which tempted me to visit the islet
that had first attracted my attention, and in a few minutes I set foot upon its
banks. The whole island formed one of those delicious solitudes of the New
World which almost lead civilized man to regret the haunts of the savage. A
luxuriant vegetation bore witness to the incomparable fruitfulness of the soil.
The deep silence which is common to the wilds of North America was only broken
by the hoarse cooing of the wood-pigeon, and the tapping of the woodpecker upon
the bark of trees. I was far from supposing that this spot had ever been
inhabited, so completely did Nature seem to be left to her own caprices; but
when I reached the centre of the isle I thought that I discovered some traces
of man. I then proceeded to examine the surrounding objects with care, and I
soon perceived that a European had undoubtedly been led to seek a refuge in
this retreat. Yet what changes had taken place in the scene of his labors! The
logs which he had hastily hewn to build himself a shed had sprouted afresh; the
very props were intertwined with living verdure, and his cabin was transformed
into a bower. In the midst of these shrubs a few stones were to be seen,
blackened with fire and sprinkled with thin ashes; here the hearth had no doubt
been, and the chimney in falling had covered it with rubbish. I stood for some
time in silent admiration of the exuberance of Nature and the littleness of
man: and when I was obliged to leave that enchanting solitude, I exclaimed with
melancholy, “Are ruins, then, already here?”
In Europe we are wont to look upon a restless disposition, an unbounded desire
of riches, and an excessive love of independence, as propensities very
formidable to society. Yet these are the very elements which ensure a long and
peaceful duration to the republics of America. Without these unquiet passions
the population would collect in certain spots, and would soon be subject to
wants like those of the Old World, which it is difficult to satisfy; for such
is the present good fortune of the New World, that the vices of its inhabitants
are scarcely less favorable to society than their virtues. These circumstances
exercise a great influence on the estimation in which human actions are held in
the two hemispheres. The Americans frequently term what we should call cupidity
a laudable industry; and they blame as faint-heartedness what we consider to be
the virtue of moderate desires.
In France, simple tastes, orderly manners, domestic affections, and the
attachments which men feel to the place of their birth, are looked upon as
great guarantees of the tranquillity and happiness of the State. But in America
nothing seems to be more prejudicial to society than these virtues. The French
Canadians, who have faithfully preserved the traditions of their pristine
manners, are already embarrassed for room upon their small territory; and this
little community, which has so recently begun to exist, will shortly be a prey
to the calamities incident to old nations. In Canada, the most enlightened,
patriotic, and humane inhabitants make extraordinary efforts to render the
people dissatisfied with those simple enjoyments which still content it. There,
the seductions of wealth are vaunted with as much zeal as the charms of an
honest but limited income in the Old World, and more exertions are made to
excite the passions of the citizens there than to calm them elsewhere. If we
listen to their eulogies, we shall hear that nothing is more praiseworthy than
to exchange the pure and homely pleasures which even the poor man tastes in his
own country for the dull delights of prosperity under a foreign sky; to leave
the patrimonial hearth and the turf beneath which his forefathers sleep; in
short, to abandon the living and the dead in quest of fortune.
At the present time America presents a field for human effort far more
extensive than any sum of labor which can be applied to work it. In America too
much knowledge cannot be diffused; for all knowledge, whilst it may serve him
who possesses it, turns also to the advantage of those who are without it. New
wants are not to be feared, since they can be satisfied without difficulty; the
growth of human passions need not be dreaded, since all passions may find an
easy and a legitimate object; nor can men be put in possession of too much
freedom, since they are scarcely ever tempted to misuse their liberties.
The American republics of the present day are like companies of adventurers
formed to explore in common the waste lands of the New World, and busied in a
flourishing trade. The passions which agitate the Americans most deeply are not
their political but their commercial passions; or, to speak more correctly,
they introduce the habits they contract in business into their political life.
They love order, without which affairs do not prosper; and they set an especial
value upon a regular conduct, which is the foundation of a solid business; they
prefer the good sense which amasses large fortunes to that enterprising spirit
which frequently dissipates them; general ideas alarm their minds, which are
accustomed to positive calculations, and they hold practice in more honor than
theory.
It is in America that one learns to understand the influence which physical
prosperity exercises over political actions, and even over opinions which ought
to acknowledge no sway but that of reason; and it is more especially amongst
strangers that this truth is perceptible. Most of the European emigrants to the
New World carry with them that wild love of independence and of change which
our calamities are so apt to engender. I sometimes met with Europeans in the
United States who had been obliged to leave their own country on account of
their political opinions. They all astonished me by the language they held, but
one of them surprised me more than all the rest. As I was crossing one of the
most remote districts of Pennsylvania I was benighted, and obliged to beg for
hospitality at the gate of a wealthy planter, who was a Frenchman by birth. He
bade me sit down beside his fire, and we began to talk with that freedom which
befits persons who meet in the backwoods, two thousand leagues from their
native country. I was aware that my host had been a great leveller and an
ardent demagogue forty years ago, and that his name was not unknown to fame. I
was, therefore, not a little surprised to hear him discuss the rights of
property as an economist or a landowner might have done: he spoke of the
necessary gradations which fortune establishes among men, of obedience to
established laws, of the influence of good morals in commonwealths, and of the
support which religious opinions give to order and to freedom; he even went to
far as to quote an evangelical authority in corroboration of one of his
political tenets.
I listened, and marvelled at the feebleness of human reason. A proposition is
true or false, but no art can prove it to be one or the other, in the midst of
the uncertainties of science and the conflicting lessons of experience, until a
new incident disperses the clouds of doubt; I was poor, I become rich, and I am
not to expect that prosperity will act upon my conduct, and leave my judgment
free; my opinions change with my fortune, and the happy circumstances which I
turn to my advantage furnish me with that decisive argument which was before
wanting. The influence of prosperity acts still more freely upon the American
than upon strangers. The American has always seen the connection of public
order and public prosperity, intimately united as they are, go on before his
eyes; he does not conceive that one can subsist without the other; he has
therefore nothing to forget; nor has he, like so many Europeans, to unlearn the
lessons of his early education.
Influence Of The Laws Upon The Maintenance Of The Democratic Republic In The
United States
Three principal causes of the maintenance of the democratic
republic—Federal Constitutions—Municipal
institutions—Judicial power.
The principal aim of this book has been to make known the laws of the United
States; if this purpose has been accomplished, the reader is already enabled to
judge for himself which are the laws that really tend to maintain the
democratic republic, and which endanger its existence. If I have not succeeded
in explaining this in the whole course of my work, I cannot hope to do so
within the limits of a single chapter. It is not my intention to retrace the
path I have already pursued, and a very few lines will suffice to recapitulate
what I have previously explained.
Three circumstances seem to me to contribute most powerfully to the maintenance
of the democratic republic in the United States.
The first is that Federal form of Government which the Americans have adopted,
and which enables the Union to combine the power of a great empire with the
security of a small State.
The second consists in those municipal institutions which limit the despotism
of the majority, and at the same time impart a taste for freedom and a
knowledge of the art of being free to the people.
The third is to be met with in the constitution of the judicial power. I have
shown in what manner the courts of justice serve to repress the excesses of
democracy, and how they check and direct the impulses of the majority without
stopping its activity.
Influence Of Manners Upon The Maintenance Of The Democratic Republic In The
United States
I have previously remarked that the manners of the people may be considered as
one of the general causes to which the maintenance of a democratic republic in
the United States is attributable. I here used the word manners with the
meaning which the ancients attached to the word mores, for I apply it not only
to manners in their proper sense of what constitutes the character of social
intercourse, but I extend it to the various notions and opinions current among
men, and to the mass of those ideas which constitute their character of mind. I
comprise, therefore, under this term the whole moral and intellectual condition
of a people. My intention is not to draw a picture of American manners, but
simply to point out such features of them as are favorable to the maintenance
of political institutions.
Religion Considered As A Political Institution, Which Powerfully Contributes To
The Maintenance Of The Democratic Republic Amongst The Americans
North America peopled by men who professed a democratic and republican
Christianity—Arrival of the Catholics—For what reason the Catholics
form the most democratic and the most republican class at the present time.
Every religion is to be found in juxtaposition to a political opinion which is
connected with it by affinity. If the human mind be left to follow its own
bent, it will regulate the temporal and spiritual institutions of society upon
one uniform principle; and man will endeavor, if I may use the expression, to
harmonize the state in which he lives upon earth with the state which he
believes to await him in heaven. The greatest part of British America was
peopled by men who, after having shaken off the authority of the Pope,
acknowledged no other religious supremacy; they brought with them into the New
World a form of Christianity which I cannot better describe than by styling it
a democratic and republican religion. This sect contributed powerfully to the
establishment of a democracy and a republic, and from the earliest settlement
of the emigrants politics and religion contracted an alliance which has never
been dissolved.
About fifty years ago Ireland began to pour a Catholic population into the
United States; on the other hand, the Catholics of America made proselytes, and
at the present moment more than a million of Christians professing the truths
of the Church of Rome are to be met with in the Union. *d The Catholics are
faithful to the observances of their religion; they are fervent and zealous in
the support and belief of their doctrines. Nevertheless they constitute the
most republican and the most democratic class of citizens which exists in the
United States; and although this fact may surprise the observer at first, the
causes by which it is occasioned may easily be discovered upon reflection.
d 
[ [It is difficult to ascertain with accuracy the amount of the Roman Catholic
population of the United States, but in 1868 an able writer in the
“Edinburgh Review” (vol. cxxvii. p. 521) affirmed that the whole
Catholic population of the United States was then about 4,000,000, divided into
43 dioceses, with 3,795 churches, under the care of 45 bishops and 2,317
clergymen. But this rapid increase is mainly supported by immigration from the
Catholic countries of Europe.]]
I think that the Catholic religion has erroneously been looked upon as the
natural enemy of democracy. Amongst the various sects of Christians,
Catholicism seems to me, on the contrary, to be one of those which are most
favorable to the equality of conditions. In the Catholic Church, the religious
community is composed of only two elements, the priest and the people. The
priest alone rises above the rank of his flock, and all below him are equal.
On doctrinal points the Catholic faith places all human capacities upon the
same level; it subjects the wise and ignorant, the man of genius and the vulgar
crowd, to the details of the same creed; it imposes the same observances upon
the rich and needy, it inflicts the same austerities upon the strong and the
weak, it listens to no compromise with mortal man, but, reducing all the human
race to the same standard, it confounds all the distinctions of society at the
foot of the same altar, even as they are confounded in the sight of God. If
Catholicism predisposes the faithful to obedience, it certainly does not
prepare them for inequality; but the contrary may be said of Protestantism,
which generally tends to make men independent, more than to render them equal.
Catholicism is like an absolute monarchy; if the sovereign be removed, all the
other classes of society are more equal than they are in republics. It has not
unfrequently occurred that the Catholic priest has left the service of the
altar to mix with the governing powers of society, and to take his place
amongst the civil gradations of men. This religious influence has sometimes
been used to secure the interests of that political state of things to which he
belonged. At other times Catholics have taken the side of aristocracy from a
spirit of religion.
But no sooner is the priesthood entirely separated from the government, as is
the case in the United States, than is found that no class of men are more
naturally disposed than the Catholics to transfuse the doctrine of the equality
of conditions into the political world. If, then, the Catholic citizens of the
United States are not forcibly led by the nature of their tenets to adopt
democratic and republican principles, at least they are not necessarily opposed
to them; and their social position, as well as their limited number, obliges
them to adopt these opinions. Most of the Catholics are poor, and they have no
chance of taking a part in the government unless it be open to all the
citizens. They constitute a minority, and all rights must be respected in order
to insure to them the free exercise of their own privileges. These two causes
induce them, unconsciously, to adopt political doctrines, which they would
perhaps support with less zeal if they were rich and preponderant.
The Catholic clergy of the United States has never attempted to oppose this
political tendency, but it seeks rather to justify its results. The priests in
America have divided the intellectual world into two parts: in the one they
place the doctrines of revealed religion, which command their assent; in the
other they leave those truths which they believe to have been freely left open
to the researches of political inquiry. Thus the Catholics of the United States
are at the same time the most faithful believers and the most zealous citizens.
It may be asserted that in the United States no religious doctrine displays the
slightest hostility to democratic and republican institutions. The clergy of
all the different sects hold the same language, their opinions are consonant to
the laws, and the human intellect flows onwards in one sole current.
I happened to be staying in one of the largest towns in the Union, when I was
invited to attend a public meeting which had been called for the purpose of
assisting the Poles, and of sending them supplies of arms and money. I found
two or three thousand persons collected in a vast hall which had been prepared
to receive them. In a short time a priest in his ecclesiastical robes advanced
to the front of the hustings: the spectators rose, and stood uncovered, whilst
he spoke in the following terms:—
“Almighty God! the God of Armies! Thou who didst strengthen the hearts
and guide the arms of our fathers when they were fighting for the sacred rights
of national independence; Thou who didst make them triumph over a hateful
oppression, and hast granted to our people the benefits of liberty and peace;
Turn, O Lord, a favorable eye upon the other hemisphere; pitifully look down
upon that heroic nation which is even now struggling as we did in the former
time, and for the same rights which we defended with our blood. Thou, who didst
create Man in the likeness of the same image, let not tyranny mar Thy work, and
establish inequality upon the earth. Almighty God! do Thou watch over the
destiny of the Poles, and render them worthy to be free. May Thy wisdom direct
their councils, and may Thy strength sustain their arms! Shed forth Thy terror
over their enemies, scatter the powers which take counsel against them; and
vouchsafe that the injustice which the world has witnessed for fifty years, be
not consummated in our time. O Lord, who holdest alike the hearts of nations
and of men in Thy powerful hand; raise up allies to the sacred cause of right;
arouse the French nation from the apathy in which its rulers retain it, that it
go forth again to fight for the liberties of the world.
“Lord, turn not Thou Thy face from us, and grant that we may always be
the most religious as well as the freest people of the earth. Almighty God,
hear our supplications this day. Save the Poles, we beseech Thee, in the name
of Thy well-beloved Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, who died upon the cross for the
salvation of men. Amen.”
The whole meeting responded “Amen!” with devotion.
Indirect Influence Of Religious Opinions Upon Political Society In The United
States
Christian morality common to all sects—Influence of religion upon the
manners of the Americans—Respect for the marriage tie—In what
manner religion confines the imagination of the Americans within certain
limits, and checks the passion of innovation—Opinion of the Americans on
the political utility of religion—Their exertions to extend and secure
its predominance.
I have just shown what the direct influence of religion upon politics is in the
United States, but its indirect influence appears to me to be still more
considerable, and it never instructs the Americans more fully in the art of
being free than when it says nothing of freedom.
The sects which exist in the United States are innumerable. They all differ in
respect to the worship which is due from man to his Creator, but they all agree
in respect to the duties which are due from man to man. Each sect adores the
Deity in its own peculiar manner, but all the sects preach the same moral law
in the name of God. If it be of the highest importance to man, as an
individual, that his religion should be true, the case of society is not the
same. Society has no future life to hope for or to fear; and provided the
citizens profess a religion, the peculiar tenets of that religion are of very
little importance to its interests. Moreover, almost all the sects of the
United States are comprised within the great unity of Christianity, and
Christian morality is everywhere the same.
It may be believed without unfairness that a certain number of Americans pursue
a peculiar form of worship, from habit more than from conviction. In the United
States the sovereign authority is religious, and consequently hypocrisy must be
common; but there is no country in the whole world in which the Christian
religion retains a greater influence over the souls of men than in America; and
there can be no greater proof of its utility, and of its conformity to human
nature, than that its influence is most powerfully felt over the most
enlightened and free nation of the earth.
I have remarked that the members of the American clergy in general, without
even excepting those who do not admit religious liberty, are all in favor of
civil freedom; but they do not support any particular political system. They
keep aloof from parties and from public affairs. In the United States religion
exercises but little influence upon the laws and upon the details of public
opinion, but it directs the manners of the community, and by regulating
domestic life it regulates the State.
I do not question that the great austerity of manners which is observable in
the United States, arises, in the first instance, from religious faith.
Religion is often unable to restrain man from the numberless temptations of
fortune; nor can it check that passion for gain which every incident of his
life contributes to arouse, but its influence over the mind of woman is
supreme, and women are the protectors of morals. There is certainly no country
in the world where the tie of marriage is so much respected as in America, or
where conjugal happiness is more highly or worthily appreciated. In Europe
almost all the disturbances of society arise from the irregularities of
domestic life. To despise the natural bonds and legitimate pleasures of home,
is to contract a taste for excesses, a restlessness of heart, and the evil of
fluctuating desires. Agitated by the tumultuous passions which frequently
disturb his dwelling, the European is galled by the obedience which the
legislative powers of the State exact. But when the American retires from the
turmoil of public life to the bosom of his family, he finds in it the image of
order and of peace. There his pleasures are simple and natural, his joys are
innocent and calm; and as he finds that an orderly life is the surest path to
happiness, he accustoms himself without difficulty to moderate his opinions as
well as his tastes. Whilst the European endeavors to forget his domestic
troubles by agitating society, the American derives from his own home that love
of order which he afterwards carries with him into public affairs.
In the United States the influence of religion is not confined to the manners,
but it extends to the intelligence of the people. Amongst the Anglo-Americans,
there are some who profess the doctrines of Christianity from a sincere belief
in them, and others who do the same because they are afraid to be suspected of
unbelief. Christianity, therefore, reigns without any obstacle, by universal
consent; the consequence is, as I have before observed, that every principle of
the moral world is fixed and determinate, although the political world is
abandoned to the debates and the experiments of men. Thus the human mind is
never left to wander across a boundless field; and, whatever may be its
pretensions, it is checked from time to time by barriers which it cannot
surmount. Before it can perpetrate innovation, certain primal and immutable
principles are laid down, and the boldest conceptions of human device are
subjected to certain forms which retard and stop their completion.
The imagination of the Americans, even in its greatest flights, is circumspect
and undecided; its impulses are checked, and its works unfinished. These habits
of restraint recur in political society, and are singularly favorable both to
the tranquillity of the people and to the durability of the institutions it has
established. Nature and circumstances concurred to make the inhabitants of the
United States bold men, as is sufficiently attested by the enterprising spirit
with which they seek for fortune. If the mind of the Americans were free from
all trammels, they would very shortly become the most daring innovators and the
most implacable disputants in the world. But the revolutionists of America are
obliged to profess an ostensible respect for Christian morality and equity,
which does not easily permit them to violate the laws that oppose their
designs; nor would they find it easy to surmount the scruples of their
partisans, even if they were able to get over their own. Hitherto no one in the
United States has dared to advance the maxim, that everything is permissible
with a view to the interests of society; an impious adage which seems to have
been invented in an age of freedom to shelter all the tyrants of future ages.
Thus whilst the law permits the Americans to do what they please, religion
prevents them from conceiving, and forbids them to commit, what is rash or
unjust.
Religion in America takes no direct part in the government of society, but it
must nevertheless be regarded as the foremost of the political institutions of
that country; for if it does not impart a taste for freedom, it facilitates the
use of free institutions. Indeed, it is in this same point of view that the
inhabitants of the United States themselves look upon religious belief. I do
not know whether all the Americans have a sincere faith in their religion, for
who can search the human heart? but I am certain that they hold it to be
indispensable to the maintenance of republican institutions. This opinion is
not peculiar to a class of citizens or to a party, but it belongs to the whole
nation, and to every rank of society.
In the United States, if a political character attacks a sect, this may not
prevent even the partisans of that very sect from supporting him; but if he
attacks all the sects together, everyone abandons him, and he remains alone.
Whilst I was in America, a witness, who happened to be called at the assizes of
the county of Chester (State of New York), declared that he did not believe in
the existence of God, or in the immortality of the soul. The judge refused to
admit his evidence, on the ground that the witness had destroyed beforehand all
the confidence of the Court in what he was about to say. *e The newspapers
related the fact without any further comment.
e 
[ The New York “Spectator” of August 23, 1831, relates the fact in
the following terms:—“The Court of Common Pleas of Chester county
(New York) a few days since rejected a witness who declared his disbelief in
the existence of God. The presiding judge remarked that he had not before been
aware that there was a man living who did not believe in the existence of God;
that this belief constituted the sanction of all testimony in a court of
justice, and that he knew of no cause in a Christian country where a witness
had been permitted to testify without such belief.”]
The Americans combine the notions of Christianity and of liberty so intimately
in their minds, that it is impossible to make them conceive the one without the
other; and with them this conviction does not spring from that barren
traditionary faith which seems to vegetate in the soul rather than to live.
I have known of societies formed by the Americans to send out ministers of the
Gospel into the new Western States to found schools and churches there, lest
religion should be suffered to die away in those remote settlements, and the
rising States be less fitted to enjoy free institutions than the people from
which they emanated. I met with wealthy New Englanders who abandoned the
country in which they were born in order to lay the foundations of Christianity
and of freedom on the banks of the Missouri, or in the prairies of Illinois.
Thus religious zeal is perpetually stimulated in the United States by the
duties of patriotism. These men do not act from an exclusive consideration of
the promises of a future life; eternity is only one motive of their devotion to
the cause; and if you converse with these missionaries of Christian
civilization, you will be surprised to find how much value they set upon the
goods of this world, and that you meet with a politician where you expected to
find a priest. They will tell you that “all the American republics are
collectively involved with each other; if the republics of the West were to
fall into anarchy, or to be mastered by a despot, the republican institutions
which now flourish upon the shores of the Atlantic Ocean would be in great
peril. It is, therefore, our interest that the new States should be religious,
in order to maintain our liberties.”
Such are the opinions of the Americans, and if any hold that the religious
spirit which I admire is the very thing most amiss in America, and that the
only element wanting to the freedom and happiness of the human race is to
believe in some blind cosmogony, or to assert with Cabanis the secretion of
thought by the brain, I can only reply that those who hold this language have
never been in America, and that they have never seen a religious or a free
nation. When they return from their expedition, we shall hear what they have to
say.
There are persons in France who look upon republican institutions as a
temporary means of power, of wealth, and distinction; men who are the
condottieri of liberty, and who fight for their own advantage, whatever be the
colors they wear: it is not to these that I address myself. But there are
others who look forward to the republican form of government as a tranquil and
lasting state, towards which modern society is daily impelled by the ideas and
manners of the time, and who sincerely desire to prepare men to be free. When
these men attack religious opinions, they obey the dictates of their passions
to the prejudice of their interests. Despotism may govern without faith, but
liberty cannot. Religion is much more necessary in the republic which they set
forth in glowing colors than in the monarchy which they attack; and it is more
needed in democratic republics than in any others. How is it possible that
society should escape destruction if the moral tie be not strengthened in
proportion as the political tie is relaxed? and what can be done with a people
which is its own master, if it be not submissive to the Divinity?
Principal Causes Which Render Religion Powerful In America Care taken by the
Americans to separate the Church from the State—The laws, public opinion,
and even the exertions of the clergy concur to promote this end—Influence
of religion upon the mind in the United States attributable to this
cause—Reason of this—What is the natural state of men with regard
to religion at the present time—What are the peculiar and incidental
causes which prevent men, in certain countries, from arriving at this state.
The philosophers of the eighteenth century explained the gradual decay of
religious faith in a very simple manner. Religious zeal, said they, must
necessarily fail, the more generally liberty is established and knowledge
diffused. Unfortunately, facts are by no means in accordance with their theory.
There are certain populations in Europe whose unbelief is only equalled by
their ignorance and their debasement, whilst in America one of the freest and
most enlightened nations in the world fulfils all the outward duties of
religious fervor.
Upon my arrival in the United States, the religious aspect of the country was
the first thing that struck my attention; and the longer I stayed there the
more did I perceive the great political consequences resulting from this state
of things, to which I was unaccustomed. In France I had almost always seen the
spirit of religion and the spirit of freedom pursuing courses diametrically
opposed to each other; but in America I found that they were intimately united,
and that they reigned in common over the same country. My desire to discover
the causes of this phenomenon increased from day to day. In order to satisfy it
I questioned the members of all the different sects; and I more especially
sought the society of the clergy, who are the depositaries of the different
persuasions, and who are more especially interested in their duration. As a
member of the Roman Catholic Church I was more particularly brought into
contact with several of its priests, with whom I became intimately acquainted.
To each of these men I expressed my astonishment and I explained my doubts; I
found that they differed upon matters of detail alone; and that they mainly
attributed the peaceful dominion of religion in their country to the separation
of Church and State. I do not hesitate to affirm that during my stay in America
I did not meet with a single individual, of the clergy or of the laity, who was
not of the same opinion upon this point.
This led me to examine more attentively than I had hitherto done, the station
which the American clergy occupy in political society. I learned with surprise
that they filled no public appointments; *f not one of them is to be met with
in the administration, and they are not even represented in the legislative
assemblies. In several States *g the law excludes them from political life,
public opinion in all. And when I came to inquire into the prevailing spirit of
the clergy I found that most of its members seemed to retire of their own
accord from the exercise of power, and that they made it the pride of their
profession to abstain from politics.
f 
[ Unless this term be applied to the functions which many of them fill in the
schools. Almost all education is entrusted to the clergy.]
g 
[ See the Constitution of New York, art. 7, Section 4:— “And
whereas the ministers of the gospel are, by their profession, dedicated to the
service of God and the care of souls, and ought not to be diverted from the
great duties of their functions: therefore no minister of the gospel, or priest
of any denomination whatsoever, shall at any time hereafter, under any pretence
or description whatever, be eligible to, or capable of holding, any civil or
military office or place within this State.”
See also the constitutions of North Carolina, art. 31; Virginia; South
Carolina, art. I, Section 23; Kentucky, art. 2, Section 26; Tennessee, art. 8,
Section I; Louisiana, art. 2, Section 22.]
I heard them inveigh against ambition and deceit, under whatever political
opinions these vices might chance to lurk; but I learned from their discourses
that men are not guilty in the eye of God for any opinions concerning political
government which they may profess with sincerity, any more than they are for
their mistakes in building a house or in driving a furrow. I perceived that
these ministers of the gospel eschewed all parties with the anxiety attendant
upon personal interest. These facts convinced me that what I had been told was
true; and it then became my object to investigate their causes, and to inquire
how it happened that the real authority of religion was increased by a state of
things which diminished its apparent force: these causes did not long escape my
researches.
The short space of threescore years can never content the imagination of man;
nor can the imperfect joys of this world satisfy his heart. Man alone, of all
created beings, displays a natural contempt of existence, and yet a boundless
desire to exist; he scorns life, but he dreads annihilation. These different
feelings incessantly urge his soul to the contemplation of a future state, and
religion directs his musings thither. Religion, then, is simply another form of
hope; and it is no less natural to the human heart than hope itself. Men cannot
abandon their religious faith without a kind of aberration of intellect, and a
sort of violent distortion of their true natures; but they are invincibly
brought back to more pious sentiments; for unbelief is an accident, and faith
is the only permanent state of mankind. If we only consider religious
institutions in a purely human point of view, they may be said to derive an
inexhaustible element of strength from man himself, since they belong to one of
the constituent principles of human nature.
I am aware that at certain times religion may strengthen this influence, which
originates in itself, by the artificial power of the laws, and by the support
of those temporal institutions which direct society. Religions, intimately
united to the governments of the earth, have been known to exercise a sovereign
authority derived from the twofold source of terror and of faith; but when a
religion contracts an alliance of this nature, I do not hesitate to affirm that
it commits the same error as a man who should sacrifice his future to his
present welfare; and in obtaining a power to which it has no claim, it risks
that authority which is rightfully its own. When a religion founds its empire
upon the desire of immortality which lives in every human heart, it may aspire
to universal dominion; but when it connects itself with a government, it must
necessarily adopt maxims which are only applicable to certain nations. Thus, in
forming an alliance with a political power, religion augments its authority
over a few, and forfeits the hope of reigning over all.
As long as a religion rests upon those sentiments which are the consolation of
all affliction, it may attract the affections of mankind. But if it be mixed up
with the bitter passions of the world, it may be constrained to defend allies
whom its interests, and not the principle of love, have given to it; or to
repel as antagonists men who are still attached to its own spirit, however
opposed they may be to the powers to which it is allied. The Church cannot
share the temporal power of the State without being the object of a portion of
that animosity which the latter excites.
The political powers which seem to be most firmly established have frequently
no better guarantee for their duration than the opinions of a generation, the
interests of the time, or the life of an individual. A law may modify the
social condition which seems to be most fixed and determinate; and with the
social condition everything else must change. The powers of society are more or
less fugitive, like the years which we spend upon the earth; they succeed each
other with rapidity, like the fleeting cares of life; and no government has
ever yet been founded upon an invariable disposition of the human heart, or
upon an imperishable interest.
As long as a religion is sustained by those feelings, propensities, and
passions which are found to occur under the same forms, at all the different
periods of history, it may defy the efforts of time; or at least it can only be
destroyed by another religion. But when religion clings to the interests of the
world, it becomes almost as fragile a thing as the powers of earth. It is the
only one of them all which can hope for immortality; but if it be connected
with their ephemeral authority, it shares their fortunes, and may fall with
those transient passions which supported them for a day. The alliance which
religion contracts with political powers must needs be onerous to itself; since
it does not require their assistance to live, and by giving them its assistance
it may be exposed to decay.
The danger which I have just pointed out always exists, but it is not always
equally visible. In some ages governments seem to be imperishable; in others,
the existence of society appears to be more precarious than the life of man.
Some constitutions plunge the citizens into a lethargic somnolence, and others
rouse them to feverish excitement. When governments appear to be so strong, and
laws so stable, men do not perceive the dangers which may accrue from a union
of Church and State. When governments display so much weakness, and laws so
much inconstancy, the danger is self-evident, but it is no longer possible to
avoid it; to be effectual, measures must be taken to discover its approach.
In proportion as a nation assumes a democratic condition of society, and as
communities display democratic propensities, it becomes more and more dangerous
to connect religion with political institutions; for the time is coming when
authority will be bandied from hand to hand, when political theories will
succeed each other, and when men, laws, and constitutions will disappear, or be
modified from day to day, and this, not for a season only, but unceasingly.
Agitation and mutability are inherent in the nature of democratic republics,
just as stagnation and inertness are the law of absolute monarchies.
If the Americans, who change the head of the Government once in four years, who
elect new legislators every two years, and renew the provincial officers every
twelvemonth; if the Americans, who have abandoned the political world to the
attempts of innovators, had not placed religion beyond their reach, where could
it abide in the ebb and flow of human opinions? where would that respect which
belongs to it be paid, amidst the struggles of faction? and what would become
of its immortality, in the midst of perpetual decay? The American clergy were
the first to perceive this truth, and to act in conformity with it. They saw
that they must renounce their religious influence, if they were to strive for
political power; and they chose to give up the support of the State, rather
than to share its vicissitudes.
In America, religion is perhaps less powerful than it has been at certain
periods in the history of certain peoples; but its influence is more lasting.
It restricts itself to its own resources, but of those none can deprive it: its
circle is limited to certain principles, but those principles are entirely its
own, and under its undisputed control.
On every side in Europe we hear voices complaining of the absence of religious
faith, and inquiring the means of restoring to religion some remnant of its
pristine authority. It seems to me that we must first attentively consider what
ought to be the natural state of men with regard to religion at the present
time; and when we know what we have to hope and to fear, we may discern the end
to which our efforts ought to be directed.
The two great dangers which threaten the existence of religions are schism and
indifference. In ages of fervent devotion, men sometimes abandon their
religion, but they only shake it off in order to adopt another. Their faith
changes the objects to which it is directed, but it suffers no decline. The old
religion then excites enthusiastic attachment or bitter enmity in either party;
some leave it with anger, others cling to it with increased devotedness, and
although persuasions differ, irreligion is unknown. Such, however, is not the
case when a religious belief is secretly undermined by doctrines which may be
termed negative, since they deny the truth of one religion without affirming
that of any other. Prodigious revolutions then take place in the human mind,
without the apparent co-operation of the passions of man, and almost without
his knowledge. Men lose the objects of their fondest hopes, as if through
forgetfulness. They are carried away by an imperceptible current which they
have not the courage to stem, but which they follow with regret, since it bears
them from a faith they love, to a scepticism that plunges them into despair.
In ages which answer to this description, men desert their religious opinions
from lukewarmness rather than from dislike; they do not reject them, but the
sentiments by which they were once fostered disappear. But if the unbeliever
does not admit religion to be true, he still considers it useful. Regarding
religious institutions in a human point of view, he acknowledges their
influence upon manners and legislation. He admits that they may serve to make
men live in peace with one another, and to prepare them gently for the hour of
death. He regrets the faith which he has lost; and as he is deprived of a
treasure which he has learned to estimate at its full value, he scruples to
take it from those who still possess it.
On the other hand, those who continue to believe are not afraid openly to avow
their faith. They look upon those who do not share their persuasion as more
worthy of pity than of opposition; and they are aware that to acquire the
esteem of the unbelieving, they are not obliged to follow their example. They
are hostile to no one in the world; and as they do not consider the society in
which they live as an arena in which religion is bound to face its thousand
deadly foes, they love their contemporaries, whilst they condemn their
weaknesses and lament their errors.
As those who do not believe, conceal their incredulity; and as those who
believe, display their faith, public opinion pronounces itself in favor of
religion: love, support, and honor are bestowed upon it, and it is only by
searching the human soul that we can detect the wounds which it has received.
The mass of mankind, who are never without the feeling of religion, do not
perceive anything at variance with the established faith. The instinctive
desire of a future life brings the crowd about the altar, and opens the hearts
of men to the precepts and consolations of religion.
But this picture is not applicable to us: for there are men amongst us who have
ceased to believe in Christianity, without adopting any other religion; others
who are in the perplexities of doubt, and who already affect not to believe;
and others, again, who are afraid to avow that Christian faith which they still
cherish in secret.
Amidst these lukewarm partisans and ardent antagonists a small number of
believers exist, who are ready to brave all obstacles and to scorn all dangers
in defence of their faith. They have done violence to human weakness, in order
to rise superior to public opinion. Excited by the effort they have made, they
scarcely knew where to stop; and as they know that the first use which the
French made of independence was to attack religion, they look upon their
contemporaries with dread, and they recoil in alarm from the liberty which
their fellow-citizens are seeking to obtain. As unbelief appears to them to be
a novelty, they comprise all that is new in one indiscriminate animosity. They
are at war with their age and country, and they look upon every opinion which
is put forth there as the necessary enemy of the faith.
Such is not the natural state of men with regard to religion at the present
day; and some extraordinary or incidental cause must be at work in France to
prevent the human mind from following its original propensities and to drive it
beyond the limits at which it ought naturally to stop. I am intimately
convinced that this extraordinary and incidental cause is the close connection
of politics and religion. The unbelievers of Europe attack the Christians as
their political opponents, rather than as their religious adversaries; they
hate the Christian religion as the opinion of a party, much more than as an
error of belief; and they reject the clergy less because they are the
representatives of the Divinity than because they are the allies of authority.
In Europe, Christianity has been intimately united to the powers of the earth.
Those powers are now in decay, and it is, as it were, buried under their ruins.
The living body of religion has been bound down to the dead corpse of
superannuated polity: cut but the bonds which restrain it, and that which is
alive will rise once more. I know not what could restore the Christian Church
of Europe to the energy of its earlier days; that power belongs to God alone;
but it may be the effect of human policy to leave the faith in the full
exercise of the strength which it still retains.
How The Instruction, The Habits, And The Practical Experience Of The Americans
Promote The Success Of Their Democratic Institutions
What is to be understood by the instruction of the American people—The
human mind more superficially instructed in the United States than in
Europe—No one completely uninstructed—Reason of this—Rapidity
with which opinions are diffused even in the uncultivated States of the
West—Practical experience more serviceable to the Americans than
book-learning.
I have but little to add to what I have already said concerning the influence
which the instruction and the habits of the Americans exercise upon the
maintenance of their political institutions.
America has hitherto produced very few writers of distinction; it possesses no
great historians, and not a single eminent poet. The inhabitants of that
country look upon what are properly styled literary pursuits with a kind of
disapprobation; and there are towns of very second-rate importance in Europe in
which more literary works are annually published than in the twenty-four States
of the Union put together. The spirit of the Americans is averse to general
ideas; and it does not seek theoretical discoveries. Neither politics nor
manufactures direct them to these occupations; and although new laws are
perpetually enacted in the United States, no great writers have hitherto
inquired into the general principles of their legislation. The Americans have
lawyers and commentators, but no jurists; *h and they furnish examples rather
than lessons to the world. The same observation applies to the mechanical arts.
In America, the inventions of Europe are adopted with sagacity; they are
perfected, and adapted with admirable skill to the wants of the country.
Manufactures exist, but the science of manufacture is not cultivated; and they
have good workmen, but very few inventors. Fulton was obliged to proffer his
services to foreign nations for a long time before he was able to devote them
to his own country.
h 
[ [This cannot be said with truth of the country of Kent, Story, and Wheaton.]]
The observer who is desirous of forming an opinion on the state of instruction
amongst the Anglo-Americans must consider the same object from two different
points of view. If he only singles out the learned, he will be astonished to
find how rare they are; but if he counts the ignorant, the American people will
appear to be the most enlightened community in the world. The whole population,
as I observed in another place, is situated between these two extremes. In New
England, every citizen receives the elementary notions of human knowledge; he
is moreover taught the doctrines and the evidences of his religion, the history
of his country, and the leading features of its Constitution. In the States of
Connecticut and Massachusetts, it is extremely rare to find a man imperfectly
acquainted with all these things, and a person wholly ignorant of them is a
sort of phenomenon.
When I compare the Greek and Roman republics with these American States; the
manuscript libraries of the former, and their rude population, with the
innumerable journals and the enlightened people of the latter; when I remember
all the attempts which are made to judge the modern republics by the assistance
of those of antiquity, and to infer what will happen in our time from what took
place two thousand years ago, I am tempted to burn my books, in order to apply
none but novel ideas to so novel a condition of society.
What I have said of New England must not, however, be applied indistinctly to
the whole Union; as we advance towards the West or the South, the instruction
of the people diminishes. In the States which are adjacent to the Gulf of
Mexico, a certain number of individuals may be found, as in our own countries,
who are devoid of the rudiments of instruction. But there is not a single
district in the United States sunk in complete ignorance; and for a very simple
reason: the peoples of Europe started from the darkness of a barbarous
condition, to advance toward the light of civilization; their progress has been
unequal; some of them have improved apace, whilst others have loitered in their
course, and some have stopped, and are still sleeping upon the way. *i
i 
[ [In the Northern States the number of persons destitute of instruction is
inconsiderable, the largest number being 241,152 in the State of New York
(according to Spaulding’s “Handbook of American Statistics”
for 1874); but in the South no less than 1,516,339 whites and 2,671,396 colored
persons are returned as “illiterate.”]]
Such has not been the case in the United States. The Anglo-Americans settled in
a state of civilization, upon that territory which their descendants occupy;
they had not to begin to learn, and it was sufficient for them not to forget.
Now the children of these same Americans are the persons who, year by year,
transport their dwellings into the wilds; and with their dwellings their
acquired information and their esteem for knowledge. Education has taught them
the utility of instruction, and has enabled them to transmit that instruction
to their posterity. In the United States society has no infancy, but it is born
in man’s estate.
The Americans never use the word “peasant,” because they have no
idea of the peculiar class which that term denotes; the ignorance of more
remote ages, the simplicity of rural life, and the rusticity of the villager
have not been preserved amongst them; and they are alike unacquainted with the
virtues, the vices, the coarse habits, and the simple graces of an early stage
of civilization. At the extreme borders of the Confederate States, upon the
confines of society and of the wilderness, a population of bold adventurers
have taken up their abode, who pierce the solitudes of the American woods, and
seek a country there, in order to escape that poverty which awaited them in
their native provinces. As soon as the pioneer arrives upon the spot which is
to serve him for a retreat, he fells a few trees and builds a loghouse. Nothing
can offer a more miserable aspect than these isolated dwellings. The traveller
who approaches one of them towards nightfall, sees the flicker of the
hearth-flame through the chinks in the walls; and at night, if the wind rises,
he hears the roof of boughs shake to and fro in the midst of the great forest
trees. Who would not suppose that this poor hut is the asylum of rudeness and
ignorance? Yet no sort of comparison can be drawn between the pioneer and the
dwelling which shelters him. Everything about him is primitive and unformed,
but he is himself the result of the labor and the experience of eighteen
centuries. He wears the dress, and he speaks the language of cities; he is
acquainted with the past, curious of the future, and ready for argument upon
the present; he is, in short, a highly civilized being, who consents, for a
time, to inhabit the backwoods, and who penetrates into the wilds of the New
World with the Bible, an axe, and a file of newspapers.
It is difficult to imagine the incredible rapidity with which public opinion
circulates in the midst of these deserts. *j I do not think that so much
intellectual intercourse takes place in the most enlightened and populous
districts of France. *k It cannot be doubted that, in the United States, the
instruction of the people powerfully contributes to the support of a democratic
republic; and such must always be the case, I believe, where instruction which
awakens the understanding is not separated from moral education which amends
the heart. But I by no means exaggerate this benefit, and I am still further
from thinking, as so many people do think in Europe, that men can be
instantaneously made citizens by teaching them to read and write. True
information is mainly derived from experience; and if the Americans had not
been gradually accustomed to govern themselves, their book-learning would not
assist them much at the present day.
j 
[ I travelled along a portion of the frontier of the United States in a sort of
cart which was termed the mail. We passed, day and night, with great rapidity
along the roads which were scarcely marked out, through immense forests; when
the gloom of the woods became impenetrable the coachman lighted branches of
fir, and we journeyed along by the light they cast. From time to time we came
to a hut in the midst of the forest, which was a post-office. The mail dropped
an enormous bundle of letters at the door of this isolated dwelling, and we
pursued our way at full gallop, leaving the inhabitants of the neighboring log
houses to send for their share of the treasure.
[When the author visited America the locomotive and the railroad were scarcely
invented, and not yet introduced in the United States. It is superfluous to
point out the immense effect of those inventions in extending civilization and
developing the resources of that vast continent. In 1831 there were 51 miles of
railway in the United States; in 1872 there were 60,000 miles of railway.]]
k 
[ In 1832 each inhabitant of Michigan paid a sum equivalent to 1 fr. 22 cent.
(French money) to the post-office revenue, and each inhabitant of the Floridas
paid 1 fr. 5 cent. (See “National Calendar,” 1833, p. 244.) In the
same year each inhabitant of the Departement du Nord paid 1 fr. 4 cent. to the
revenue of the French post-office. (See the “Compte rendu de
l’administration des Finances,” 1833, p. 623.) Now the State of
Michigan only contained at that time 7 inhabitants per square league and
Florida only 5: the public instruction and the commercial activity of these
districts is inferior to that of most of the States in the Union, whilst the
Departement du Nord, which contains 3,400 inhabitants per square league, is one
of the most enlightened and manufacturing parts of France.]
I have lived a great deal with the people in the United States, and I cannot
express how much I admire their experience and their good sense. An American
should never be allowed to speak of Europe; for he will then probably display a
vast deal of presumption and very foolish pride. He will take up with those
crude and vague notions which are so useful to the ignorant all over the world.
But if you question him respecting his own country, the cloud which dimmed his
intelligence will immediately disperse; his language will become as clear and
as precise as his thoughts. He will inform you what his rights are, and by what
means he exercises them; he will be able to point out the customs which obtain
in the political world. You will find that he is well acquainted with the rules
of the administration, and that he is familiar with the mechanism of the laws.
The citizen of the United States does not acquire his practical science and his
positive notions from books; the instruction he has acquired may have prepared
him for receiving those ideas, but it did not furnish them. The American learns
to know the laws by participating in the act of legislation; and he takes a
lesson in the forms of government from governing. The great work of society is
ever going on beneath his eyes, and, as it were, under his hands.
In the United States politics are the end and aim of education; in Europe its
principal object is to fit men for private life. The interference of the
citizens in public affairs is too rare an occurrence for it to be anticipated
beforehand. Upon casting a glance over society in the two hemispheres, these
differences are indicated even by its external aspect.
In Europe we frequently introduce the ideas and the habits of private life into
public affairs; and as we pass at once from the domestic circle to the
government of the State, we may frequently be heard to discuss the great
interests of society in the same manner in which we converse with our friends.
The Americans, on the other hand, transfuse the habits of public life into
their manners in private; and in their country the jury is introduced into the
games of schoolboys, and parliamentary forms are observed in the order of a
feast.
The Laws Contribute More To The Maintenance Of The Democratic Republic In The
United States Than The Physical Circumstances Of The Country, And The Manners
More Than The Laws
All the nations of America have a democratic state of society—Yet
democratic institutions only subsist amongst the Anglo-Americans—The
Spaniards of South America, equally favored by physical causes as the
Anglo-Americans, unable to maintain a democratic republic—Mexico, which
has adopted the Constitution of the United States, in the same
predicament—The Anglo-Americans of the West less able to maintain it than
those of the East—Reason of these different results.
I have remarked that the maintenance of democratic institutions in the United
States is attributable to the circumstances, the laws, and the manners of that
country. *l Most Europeans are only acquainted with the first of these three
causes, and they are apt to give it a preponderating importance which it does
not really possess.
l 
[ I remind the reader of the general signification which I give to the word
“manners,” namely, the moral and intellectual characteristics of
social man taken collectively.]
It is true that the Anglo-Saxons settled in the New World in a state of social
equality; the low-born and the noble were not to be found amongst them; and
professional prejudices were always as entirely unknown as the prejudices of
birth. Thus, as the condition of society was democratic, the empire of
democracy was established without difficulty. But this circumstance is by no
means peculiar to the United States; almost all the trans-Atlantic colonies
were founded by men equal amongst themselves, or who became so by inhabiting
them. In no one part of the New World have Europeans been able to create an
aristocracy. Nevertheless, democratic institutions prosper nowhere but in the
United States.
The American Union has no enemies to contend with; it stands in the wilds like
an island in the ocean. But the Spaniards of South America were no less
isolated by nature; yet their position has not relieved them from the charge of
standing armies. They make war upon each other when they have no foreign
enemies to oppose; and the Anglo-American democracy is the only one which has
hitherto been able to maintain itself in peace. *m
m 
[ [A remark which, since the great Civil War of 1861-65, ceases to be
applicable.]]
The territory of the Union presents a boundless field to human activity, and
inexhaustible materials for industry and labor. The passion of wealth takes the
place of ambition, and the warmth of faction is mitigated by a sense of
prosperity. But in what portion of the globe shall we meet with more fertile
plains, with mightier rivers, or with more unexplored and inexhaustible riches
than in South America?
Nevertheless, South America has been unable to maintain democratic
institutions. If the welfare of nations depended on their being placed in a
remote position, with an unbounded space of habitable territory before them,
the Spaniards of South America would have no reason to complain of their fate.
And although they might enjoy less prosperity than the inhabitants of the
United States, their lot might still be such as to excite the envy of some
nations in Europe. There are, however, no nations upon the face of the earth
more miserable than those of South America.
Thus, not only are physical causes inadequate to produce results analogous to
those which occur in North America, but they are unable to raise the population
of South America above the level of European States, where they act in a
contrary direction. Physical causes do not, therefore, affect the destiny of
nations so much as has been supposed.
I have met with men in New England who were on the point of leaving a country,
where they might have remained in easy circumstances, to go to seek their
fortune in the wilds. Not far from that district I found a French population in
Canada, which was closely crowded on a narrow territory, although the same
wilds were at hand; and whilst the emigrant from the United States purchased an
extensive estate with the earnings of a short term of labor, the Canadian paid
as much for land as he would have done in France. Nature offers the solitudes
of the New World to Europeans; but they are not always acquainted with the
means of turning her gifts to account. Other peoples of America have the same
physical conditions of prosperity as the Anglo-Americans, but without their
laws and their manners; and these peoples are wretched. The laws and manners of
the Anglo-Americans are therefore that efficient cause of their greatness which
is the object of my inquiry.
I am far from supposing that the American laws are preeminently good in
themselves; I do not hold them to be applicable to all democratic peoples; and
several of them seem to be dangerous, even in the United States. Nevertheless,
it cannot be denied that the American legislation, taken collectively, is
extremely well adapted to the genius of the people and the nature of the
country which it is intended to govern. The American laws are therefore good,
and to them must be attributed a large portion of the success which attends the
government of democracy in America: but I do not believe them to be the
principal cause of that success; and if they seem to me to have more influence
upon the social happiness of the Americans than the nature of the country, on
the other hand there is reason to believe that their effect is still inferior
to that produced by the manners of the people.
The Federal laws undoubtedly constitute the most important part of the
legislation of the United States. Mexico, which is not less fortunately
situated than the Anglo-American Union, has adopted the same laws, but is
unable to accustom itself to the government of democracy. Some other cause is
therefore at work, independently of those physical circumstances and peculiar
laws which enable the democracy to rule in the United States.
Another still more striking proof may be adduced. Almost all the inhabitants of
the territory of the Union are the descendants of a common stock; they speak
the same language, they worship God in the same manner, they are affected by
the same physical causes, and they obey the same laws. Whence, then, do their
characteristic differences arise? Why, in the Eastern States of the Union, does
the republican government display vigor and regularity, and proceed with mature
deliberation? Whence does it derive the wisdom and the durability which mark
its acts, whilst in the Western States, on the contrary, society seems to be
ruled by the powers of chance? There, public business is conducted with an
irregularity and a passionate and feverish excitement, which does not announce
a long or sure duration.
I am no longer comparing the Anglo-American States to foreign nations; but I am
contrasting them with each other, and endeavoring to discover why they are so
unlike. The arguments which are derived from the nature of the country and the
difference of legislation are here all set aside. Recourse must be had to some
other cause; and what other cause can there be except the manners of the
people?
It is in the Eastern States that the Anglo-Americans have been longest
accustomed to the government of democracy, and that they have adopted the
habits and conceived the notions most favorable to its maintenance. Democracy
has gradually penetrated into their customs, their opinions, and the forms of
social intercourse; it is to be found in all the details of daily life equally
as in the laws. In the Eastern States the instruction and practical education
of the people have been most perfected, and religion has been most thoroughly
amalgamated with liberty. Now these habits, opinions, customs, and convictions
are precisely the constituent elements of that which I have denominated
manners.
In the Western States, on the contrary, a portion of the same advantages is
still wanting. Many of the Americans of the West were born in the woods, and
they mix the ideas and the customs of savage life with the civilization of
their parents. Their passions are more intense; their religious morality less
authoritative; and their convictions less secure. The inhabitants exercise no
sort of control over their fellow-citizens, for they are scarcely acquainted
with each other. The nations of the West display, to a certain extent, the
inexperience and the rude habits of a people in its infancy; for although they
are composed of old elements, their assemblage is of recent date.
The manners of the Americans of the United States are, then, the real cause
which renders that people the only one of the American nations that is able to
support a democratic government; and it is the influence of manners which
produces the different degrees of order and of prosperity that may be
distinguished in the several Anglo-American democracies. Thus the effect which
the geographical position of a country may have upon the duration of democratic
institutions is exaggerated in Europe. Too much importance is attributed to
legislation, too little to manners. These three great causes serve, no doubt,
to regulate and direct the American democracy; but if they were to be classed
in their proper order, I should say that the physical circumstances are less
efficient than the laws, and the laws very subordinate to the manners of the
people. I am convinced that the most advantageous situation and the best
possible laws cannot maintain a constitution in spite of the manners of a
country; whilst the latter may turn the most unfavorable positions and the
worst laws to some advantage. The importance of manners is a common truth to
which study and experience incessantly direct our attention. It may be regarded
as a central point in the range of human observation, and the common
termination of all inquiry. So seriously do I insist upon this head, that if I
have hitherto failed in making the reader feel the important influence which I
attribute to the practical experience, the habits, the opinions, in short, to
the manners of the Americans, upon the maintenance of their institutions, I
have failed in the principal object of my work.
Whether Laws And Manners Are Sufficient To Maintain Democratic Institutions In
Other Countries Besides America
The Anglo-Americans, if transported into Europe, would be obliged to modify
their laws—Distinction to be made between democratic institutions and
American institutions—Democratic laws may be conceived better than, or at
least different from, those which the American democracy has adopted—The
example of America only proves that it is possible to regulate democracy by the
assistance of manners and legislation.
I have asserted that the success of democratic institutions in the United
States is more intimately connected with the laws themselves, and the manners
of the people, than with the nature of the country. But does it follow that the
same causes would of themselves produce the same results, if they were put into
operation elsewhere; and if the country is no adequate substitute for laws and
manners, can laws and manners in their turn prove a substitute for the country?
It will readily be understood that the necessary elements of a reply to this
question are wanting: other peoples are to be found in the New World besides
the Anglo-Americans, and as these people are affected by the same physical
circumstances as the latter, they may fairly be compared together. But there
are no nations out of America which have adopted the same laws and manners,
being destitute of the physical advantages peculiar to the Anglo-Americans. No
standard of comparison therefore exists, and we can only hazard an opinion upon
this subject.
It appears to me, in the first place, that a careful distinction must be made
between the institutions of the United States and democratic institutions in
general. When I reflect upon the state of Europe, its mighty nations, its
populous cities, its formidable armies, and the complex nature of its politics,
I cannot suppose that even the Anglo-Americans, if they were transported to our
hemisphere, with their ideas, their religion, and their manners, could exist
without considerably altering their laws. But a democratic nation may be
imagined, organized differently from the American people. It is not impossible
to conceive a government really established upon the will of the majority; but
in which the majority, repressing its natural propensity to equality, should
consent, with a view to the order and the stability of the State, to invest a
family or an individual with all the prerogatives of the executive. A
democratic society might exist, in which the forces of the nation would be more
centralized than they are in the United States; the people would exercise a
less direct and less irresistible influence upon public affairs, and yet every
citizen invested with certain rights would participate, within his sphere, in
the conduct of the government. The observations I made amongst the
Anglo-Americans induce me to believe that democratic institutions of this kind,
prudently introduced into society, so as gradually to mix with the habits and
to be interfused with the opinions of the people, might subsist in other
countries besides America. If the laws of the United States were the only
imaginable democratic laws, or the most perfect which it is possible to
conceive, I should admit that the success of those institutions affords no
proof of the success of democratic institutions in general, in a country less
favored by natural circumstances. But as the laws of America appear to me to be
defective in several respects, and as I can readily imagine others of the same
general nature, the peculiar advantages of that country do not prove that
democratic institutions cannot succeed in a nation less favored by
circumstances, if ruled by better laws.
If human nature were different in America from what it is elsewhere; or if the
social condition of the Americans engendered habits and opinions amongst them
different from those which originate in the same social condition in the Old
World, the American democracies would afford no means of predicting what may
occur in other democracies. If the Americans displayed the same propensities as
all other democratic nations, and if their legislators had relied upon the
nature of the country and the favor of circumstances to restrain those
propensities within due limits, the prosperity of the United States would be
exclusively attributable to physical causes, and it would afford no
encouragement to a people inclined to imitate their example, without sharing
their natural advantages. But neither of these suppositions is borne out by
facts.
In America the same passions are to be met with as in Europe; some originating
in human nature, others in the democratic condition of society. Thus in the
United States I found that restlessness of heart which is natural to men, when
all ranks are nearly equal and the chances of elevation are the same to all. I
found the democratic feeling of envy expressed under a thousand different
forms. I remarked that the people frequently displayed, in the conduct of
affairs, a consummate mixture of ignorance and presumption; and I inferred that
in America, men are liable to the same failings and the same absurdities as
amongst ourselves. But upon examining the state of society more attentively, I
speedily discovered that the Americans had made great and successful efforts to
counteract these imperfections of human nature, and to correct the natural
defects of democracy. Their divers municipal laws appeared to me to be a means
of restraining the ambition of the citizens within a narrow sphere, and of
turning those same passions which might have worked havoc in the State, to the
good of the township or the parish. The American legislators have succeeded to
a certain extent in opposing the notion of rights to the feelings of envy; the
permanence of the religious world to the continual shifting of politics; the
experience of the people to its theoretical ignorance; and its practical
knowledge of business to the impatience of its desires.
The Americans, then, have not relied upon the nature of their country to
counterpoise those dangers which originate in their Constitution and in their
political laws. To evils which are common to all democratic peoples they have
applied remedies which none but themselves had ever thought of before; and
although they were the first to make the experiment, they have succeeded in it.
The manners and laws of the Americans are not the only ones which may suit a
democratic people; but the Americans have shown that it would be wrong to
despair of regulating democracy by the aid of manners and of laws. If other
nations should borrow this general and pregnant idea from the Americans,
without however intending to imitate them in the peculiar application which
they have made of it; if they should attempt to fit themselves for that social
condition, which it seems to be the will of Providence to impose upon the
generations of this age, and so to escape from the despotism or the anarchy
which threatens them; what reason is there to suppose that their efforts would
not be crowned with success? The organization and the establishment of
democracy in Christendom is the great political problem of the time. The
Americans, unquestionably, have not resolved this problem, but they furnish
useful data to those who undertake the task.
Importance Of What Precedes With Respect To The State Of Europe
It may readily be discovered with what intention I undertook the foregoing
inquiries. The question here discussed is interesting not only to the United
States, but to the whole world; it concerns, not a nation, but all mankind. If
those nations whose social condition is democratic could only remain free as
long as they are inhabitants of the wilds, we could not but despair of the
future destiny of the human race; for democracy is rapidly acquiring a more
extended sway, and the wilds are gradually peopled with men. If it were true
that laws and manners are insufficient to maintain democratic institutions,
what refuge would remain open to the nations, except the despotism of a single
individual? I am aware that there are many worthy persons at the present time
who are not alarmed at this latter alternative, and who are so tired of liberty
as to be glad of repose, far from those storms by which it is attended. But
these individuals are ill acquainted with the haven towards which they are
bound. They are so deluded by their recollections, as to judge the tendency of
absolute power by what it was formerly, and not by what it might become at the
present time.
If absolute power were re-established amongst the democratic nations of Europe,
I am persuaded that it would assume a new form, and appear under features
unknown to our forefathers. There was a time in Europe when the laws and the
consent of the people had invested princes with almost unlimited authority; but
they scarcely ever availed themselves of it. I do not speak of the prerogatives
of the nobility, of the authority of supreme courts of justice, of corporations
and their chartered rights, or of provincial privileges, which served to break
the blows of the sovereign authority, and to maintain a spirit of resistance in
the nation. Independently of these political institutions—which, however
opposed they might be to personal liberty, served to keep alive the love of
freedom in the mind of the public, and which may be esteemed to have been
useful in this respect—the manners and opinions of the nation confined
the royal authority within barriers which were not less powerful, although they
were less conspicuous. Religion, the affections of the people, the benevolence
of the prince, the sense of honor, family pride, provincial prejudices, custom,
and public opinion limited the power of kings, and restrained their authority
within an invisible circle. The constitution of nations was despotic at that
time, but their manners were free. Princes had the right, but they had neither
the means nor the desire, of doing whatever they pleased.
But what now remains of those barriers which formerly arrested the aggressions
of tyranny? Since religion has lost its empire over the souls of men, the most
prominent boundary which divided good from evil is overthrown; the very
elements of the moral world are indeterminate; the princes and the peoples of
the earth are guided by chance, and none can define the natural limits of
despotism and the bounds of license. Long revolutions have forever destroyed
the respect which surrounded the rulers of the State; and since they have been
relieved from the burden of public esteem, princes may henceforward surrender
themselves without fear to the seductions of arbitrary power.
When kings find that the hearts of their subjects are turned towards them, they
are clement, because they are conscious of their strength, and they are chary
of the affection of their people, because the affection of their people is the
bulwark of the throne. A mutual interchange of good-will then takes place
between the prince and the people, which resembles the gracious intercourse of
domestic society. The subjects may murmur at the sovereign’s decree, but
they are grieved to displease him; and the sovereign chastises his subjects
with the light hand of parental affection.
But when once the spell of royalty is broken in the tumult of revolution; when
successive monarchs have crossed the throne, so as alternately to display to
the people the weakness of their right and the harshness of their power, the
sovereign is no longer regarded by any as the Father of the State, and he is
feared by all as its master. If he be weak, he is despised; if he be strong, he
is detested. He himself is full of animosity and alarm; he finds that he is as
a stranger in his own country, and he treats his subjects like conquered
enemies.
When the provinces and the towns formed so many different nations in the midst
of their common country, each of them had a will of its own, which was opposed
to the general spirit of subjection; but now that all the parts of the same
empire, after having lost their immunities, their customs, their prejudices,
their traditions, and their names, are subjected and accustomed to the same
laws, it is not more difficult to oppress them collectively than it was
formerly to oppress them singly.
Whilst the nobles enjoyed their power, and indeed long after that power was
lost, the honor of aristocracy conferred an extraordinary degree of force upon
their personal opposition. They afford instances of men who, notwithstanding
their weakness, still entertained a high opinion of their personal value, and
dared to cope single-handed with the efforts of the public authority. But at
the present day, when all ranks are more and more confounded, when the
individual disappears in the throng, and is easily lost in the midst of a
common obscurity, when the honor of monarchy has almost lost its empire without
being succeeded by public virtue, and when nothing can enable man to rise above
himself, who shall say at what point the exigencies of power and the servility
of weakness will stop?
As long as family feeling was kept alive, the antagonist of oppression was
never alone; he looked about him, and found his clients, his hereditary
friends, and his kinsfolk. If this support was wanting, he was sustained by his
ancestors and animated by his posterity. But when patrimonial estates are
divided, and when a few years suffice to confound the distinctions of a race,
where can family feeling be found? What force can there be in the customs of a
country which has changed and is still perpetually changing its aspect; in
which every act of tyranny has a precedent, and every crime an example; in
which there is nothing so old that its antiquity can save it from destruction,
and nothing so unparalleled that its novelty can prevent it from being done?
What resistance can be offered by manners of so pliant a make that they have
already often yielded? What strength can even public opinion have retained,
when no twenty persons are connected by a common tie; when not a man, nor a
family, nor chartered corporation, nor class, nor free institution, has the
power of representing or exerting that opinion; and when every
citizen—being equally weak, equally poor, and equally dependent—has
only his personal impotence to oppose to the organized force of the government?
The annals of France furnish nothing analogous to the condition in which that
country might then be thrown. But it may more aptly be assimilated to the times
of old, and to those hideous eras of Roman oppression, when the manners of the
people were corrupted, their traditions obliterated, their habits destroyed,
their opinions shaken, and freedom, expelled from the laws, could find no
refuge in the land; when nothing protected the citizens, and the citizens no
longer protected themselves; when human nature was the sport of man, and
princes wearied out the clemency of Heaven before they exhausted the patience
of their subjects. Those who hope to revive the monarchy of Henry IV or of
Louis XIV, appear to me to be afflicted with mental blindness; and when I
consider the present condition of several European nations—a condition to
which all the others tend—I am led to believe that they will soon be left
with no other alternative than democratic liberty, or the tyranny of the
Caesars. *n
n 
[ [This prediction of the return of France to imperial despotism, and of the
true character of that despotic power, was written in 1832, and realized to the
letter in 1852.]]
And indeed it is deserving of consideration, whether men are to be entirely
emancipated or entirely enslaved; whether their rights are to be made equal, or
wholly taken away from them. If the rulers of society were reduced either
gradually to raise the crowd to their own level, or to sink the citizens below
that of humanity, would not the doubts of many be resolved, the consciences of
many be healed, and the community prepared to make great sacrifices with little
difficulty? In that case, the gradual growth of democratic manners and
institutions should be regarded, not as the best, but as the only means of
preserving freedom; and without liking the government of democracy, it might be
adopted as the most applicable and the fairest remedy for the present ills of
society.
It is difficult to associate a people in the work of government; but it is
still more difficult to supply it with experience, and to inspire it with the
feelings which it requires in order to govern well. I grant that the caprices
of democracy are perpetual; its instruments are rude; its laws imperfect. But
if it were true that soon no just medium would exist between the empire of
democracy and the dominion of a single arm, should we not rather incline
towards the former than submit voluntarily to the latter? And if complete
equality be our fate, is it not better to be levelled by free institutions than
by despotic power?
Those who, after having read this book, should imagine that my intention in
writing it has been to propose the laws and manners of the Anglo-Americans for
the imitation of all democratic peoples, would commit a very great mistake;
they must have paid more attention to the form than to the substance of my
ideas. My aim has been to show, by the example of America, that laws, and
especially manners, may exist which will allow a democratic people to remain
free. But I am very far from thinking that we ought to follow the example of
the American democracy, and copy the means which it has employed to attain its
ends; for I am well aware of the influence which the nature of a country and
its political precedents exercise upon a constitution; and I should regard it
as a great misfortune for mankind if liberty were to exist all over the world
under the same forms.
But I am of opinion that if we do not succeed in gradually introducing
democratic institutions into France, and if we despair of imparting to the
citizens those ideas and sentiments which first prepare them for freedom, and
afterwards allow them to enjoy it, there will be no independence at all, either
for the middling classes or the nobility, for the poor or for the rich, but an
equal tyranny over all; and I foresee that if the peaceable empire of the
majority be not founded amongst us in time, we shall sooner or later arrive at
the unlimited authority of a single despot.
The Present And Probable Future Condition Of The Three Races Which Inhabit The
Territory Of The United States
The principal part of the task which I had imposed upon myself is now
performed. I have shown, as far as I was able, the laws and the manners of the
American democracy. Here I might stop; but the reader would perhaps feel that I
had not satisfied his expectations.
The absolute supremacy of democracy is not all that we meet with in America;
the inhabitants of the New World may be considered from more than one point of
view. In the course of this work my subject has often led me to speak of the
Indians and the Negroes; but I have never been able to stop in order to show
what place these two races occupy in the midst of the democratic people whom I
was engaged in describing. I have mentioned in what spirit, and according to
what laws, the Anglo-American Union was formed; but I could only glance at the
dangers which menace that confederation, whilst it was equally impossible for
me to give a detailed account of its chances of duration, independently of its
laws and manners. When speaking of the united republican States, I hazarded no
conjectures upon the permanence of republican forms in the New World, and when
making frequent allusion to the commercial activity which reigns in the Union,
I was unable to inquire into the future condition of the Americans as a
commercial people.
These topics are collaterally connected with my subject without forming a part
of it; they are American without being democratic; and to portray democracy has
been my principal aim. It was therefore necessary to postpone these questions,
which I now take up as the proper termination of my work.
The territory now occupied or claimed by the American Union spreads from the
shores of the Atlantic to those of the Pacific Ocean. On the east and west its
limits are those of the continent itself. On the south it advances nearly to
the tropic, and it extends upwards to the icy regions of the North. The human
beings who are scattered over this space do not form, as in Europe, so many
branches of the same stock. Three races, naturally distinct, and, I might
almost say, hostile to each other, are discoverable amongst them at the first
glance. Almost insurmountable barriers had been raised between them by
education and by law, as well as by their origin and outward characteristics;
but fortune has brought them together on the same soil, where, although they
are mixed, they do not amalgamate, and each race fulfils its destiny apart.
Amongst these widely differing families of men, the first which attracts
attention, the superior in intelligence, in power and in enjoyment, is the
white or European, the man pre-eminent; and in subordinate grades, the negro
and the Indian. These two unhappy races have nothing in common; neither birth,
nor features, nor language, nor habits. Their only resemblance lies in their
misfortunes. Both of them occupy an inferior rank in the country they inhabit;
both suffer from tyranny; and if their wrongs are not the same, they originate,
at any rate, with the same authors.
If we reasoned from what passes in the world, we should almost say that the
European is to the other races of mankind, what man is to the lower
animals;—he makes them subservient to his use; and when he cannot subdue,
he destroys them. Oppression has, at one stroke, deprived the descendants of
the Africans of almost all the privileges of humanity. The negro of the United
States has lost all remembrance of his country; the language which his
forefathers spoke is never heard around him; he abjured their religion and
forgot their customs when he ceased to belong to Africa, without acquiring any
claim to European privileges. But he remains half way between the two
communities; sold by the one, repulsed by the other; finding not a spot in the
universe to call by the name of country, except the faint image of a home which
the shelter of his master’s roof affords.
The negro has no family; woman is merely the temporary companion of his
pleasures, and his children are upon an equality with himself from the moment
of their birth. Am I to call it a proof of God’s mercy or a visitation of
his wrath, that man in certain states appears to be insensible to his extreme
wretchedness, and almost affects, with a depraved taste, the cause of his
misfortunes? The negro, who is plunged in this abyss of evils, scarcely feels
his own calamitous situation. Violence made him a slave, and the habit of
servitude gives him the thoughts and desires of a slave; he admires his tyrants
more than he hates them, and finds his joy and his pride in the servile
imitation of those who oppress him: his understanding is degraded to the level
of his soul.
The negro enters upon slavery as soon as he is born: nay, he may have been
purchased in the womb, and have begun his slavery before he began his
existence. Equally devoid of wants and of enjoyment, and useless to himself, he
learns, with his first notions of existence, that he is the property of
another, who has an interest in preserving his life, and that the care of it
does not devolve upon himself; even the power of thought appears to him a
useless gift of Providence, and he quietly enjoys the privileges of his
debasement. If he becomes free, independence is often felt by him to be a
heavier burden than slavery; for having learned, in the course of his life, to
submit to everything except reason, he is too much unacquainted with her
dictates to obey them. A thousand new desires beset him, and he is destitute of
the knowledge and energy necessary to resist them: these are masters which it
is necessary to contend with, and he has learnt only to submit and obey. In
short, he sinks to such a depth of wretchedness, that while servitude
brutalizes, liberty destroys him.
Oppression has been no less fatal to the Indian than to the negro race, but its
effects are different. Before the arrival of white men in the New World, the
inhabitants of North America lived quietly in their woods, enduring the
vicissitudes and practising the virtues and vices common to savage nations. The
Europeans, having dispersed the Indian tribes and driven them into the deserts,
condemned them to a wandering life full of inexpressible sufferings.
Savage nations are only controlled by opinion and by custom. When the North
American Indians had lost the sentiment of attachment to their country; when
their families were dispersed, their traditions obscured, and the chain of
their recollections broken; when all their habits were changed, and their wants
increased beyond measure, European tyranny rendered them more disorderly and
less civilized than they were before. The moral and physical condition of these
tribes continually grew worse, and they became more barbarous as they became
more wretched. Nevertheless, the Europeans have not been able to metamorphose
the character of the Indians; and though they have had power to destroy them,
they have never been able to make them submit to the rules of civilized
society.
The lot of the negro is placed on the extreme limit of servitude, while that of
the Indian lies on the uttermost verge of liberty; and slavery does not produce
more fatal effects upon the first, than independence upon the second. The negro
has lost all property in his own person, and he cannot dispose of his existence
without committing a sort of fraud: but the savage is his own master as soon as
he is able to act; parental authority is scarcely known to him; he has never
bent his will to that of any of his kind, nor learned the difference between
voluntary obedience and a shameful subjection; and the very name of law is
unknown to him. To be free, with him, signifies to escape from all the shackles
of society. As he delights in this barbarous independence, and would rather
perish than sacrifice the least part of it, civilization has little power over
him.
The negro makes a thousand fruitless efforts to insinuate himself amongst men
who repulse him; he conforms to the tastes of his oppressors, adopts their
opinions, and hopes by imitating them to form a part of their community. Having
been told from infancy that his race is naturally inferior to that of the
whites, he assents to the proposition and is ashamed of his own nature. In each
of his features he discovers a trace of slavery, and, if it were in his power,
he would willingly rid himself of everything that makes him what he is.
The Indian, on the contrary, has his imagination inflated with the pretended
nobility of his origin, and lives and dies in the midst of these dreams of
pride. Far from desiring to conform his habits to ours, he loves his savage
life as the distinguishing mark of his race, and he repels every advance to
civilization, less perhaps from the hatred which he entertains for it, than
from a dread of resembling the Europeans. *a While he has nothing to oppose to
our perfection in the arts but the resources of the desert, to our tactics
nothing but undisciplined courage; whilst our well-digested plans are met by
the spontaneous instincts of savage life, who can wonder if he fails in this
unequal contest?
a 
[ The native of North America retains his opinions and the most insignificant
of his habits with a degree of tenacity which has no parallel in history. For
more than two hundred years the wandering tribes of North America have had
daily intercourse with the whites, and they have never derived from them either
a custom or an idea. Yet the Europeans have exercised a powerful influence over
the savages: they have made them more licentious, but not more European. In the
summer of 1831 I happened to be beyond Lake Michigan, at a place called Green
Bay, which serves as the extreme frontier between the United States and the
Indians on the north-western side. Here I became acquainted with an American
officer, Major H., who, after talking to me at length on the inflexibility of
the Indian character, related the following fact:—“I formerly knew
a young Indian,” said he, “who had been educated at a college in
New England, where he had greatly distinguished himself, and had acquired the
external appearance of a member of civilized society. When the war broke out
between ourselves and the English in 1810, I saw this young man again; he was
serving in our army, at the head of the warriors of his tribe, for the Indians
were admitted amongst the ranks of the Americans, upon condition that they
would abstain from their horrible custom of scalping their victims. On the
evening of the battle of . . ., C. came and sat himself down by the fire of our
bivouac. I asked him what had been his fortune that day: he related his
exploits; and growing warm and animated by the recollection of them, he
concluded by suddenly opening the breast of his coat, saying, ‘You must
not betray me—see here!’ And I actually beheld,” said the
Major, “between his body and his shirt, the skin and hair of an English
head, still dripping with gore.”]
The negro, who earnestly desires to mingle his race with that of the European,
cannot effect if; while the Indian, who might succeed to a certain extent,
disdains to make the attempt. The servility of the one dooms him to slavery,
the pride of the other to death.
I remember that while I was travelling through the forests which still cover
the State of Alabama, I arrived one day at the log house of a pioneer. I did
not wish to penetrate into the dwelling of the American, but retired to rest
myself for a while on the margin of a spring, which was not far off, in the
woods. While I was in this place (which was in the neighborhood of the Creek
territory), an Indian woman appeared, followed by a negress, and holding by the
hand a little white girl of five or six years old, whom I took to be the
daughter of the pioneer. A sort of barbarous luxury set off the costume of the
Indian; rings of metal were hanging from her nostrils and ears; her hair, which
was adorned with glass beads, fell loosely upon her shoulders; and I saw that
she was not married, for she still wore that necklace of shells which the bride
always deposits on the nuptial couch. The negress was clad in squalid European
garments. They all three came and seated themselves upon the banks of the
fountain; and the young Indian, taking the child in her arms, lavished upon her
such fond caresses as mothers give; while the negress endeavored by various
little artifices to attract the attention of the young Creole.
The child displayed in her slightest gestures a consciousness of superiority
which formed a strange contrast with her infantine weakness; as if she received
the attentions of her companions with a sort of condescension. The negress was
seated on the ground before her mistress, watching her smallest desires, and
apparently divided between strong affection for the child and servile fear;
whilst the savage displayed, in the midst of her tenderness, an air of freedom
and of pride which was almost ferocious. I had approached the group, and I
contemplated them in silence; but my curiosity was probably displeasing to the
Indian woman, for she suddenly rose, pushed the child roughly from her, and
giving me an angry look plunged into the thicket. I had often chanced to see
individuals met together in the same place, who belonged to the three races of
men which people North America. I had perceived from many different results the
preponderance of the whites. But in the picture which I have just been
describing there was something peculiarly touching; a bond of affection here
united the oppressors with the oppressed, and the effort of nature to bring
them together rendered still more striking the immense distance placed between
them by prejudice and by law.
The Present And Probable Future Condition Of The Indian Tribes Which Inhabit
The Territory Possessed By The Union
Gradual disappearance of the native tribes—Manner in which it takes
place—Miseries accompanying the forced migrations of the
Indians—The savages of North America had only two ways of escaping
destruction; war or civilization—They are no longer able to make
war—Reasons why they refused to become civilized when it was in their
power, and why they cannot become so now that they desire it—Instance of
the Creeks and Cherokees—Policy of the particular States towards these
Indians—Policy of the Federal Government.
None of the Indian tribes which formerly inhabited the territory of New
England—the Naragansetts, the Mohicans, the Pecots—have any
existence but in the recollection of man. The Lenapes, who received William
Penn, a hundred and fifty years ago, upon the banks of the Delaware, have
disappeared; and I myself met with the last of the Iroquois, who were begging
alms. The nations I have mentioned formerly covered the country to the
sea-coast; but a traveller at the present day must penetrate more than a
hundred leagues into the interior of the continent to find an Indian. Not only
have these wild tribes receded, but they are destroyed; *b and as they give way
or perish, an immense and increasing people fills their place. There is no
instance upon record of so prodigious a growth, or so rapid a destruction: the
manner in which the latter change takes place is not difficult to describe.
b 
[ In the thirteen original States there are only 6,273 Indians remaining. (See
Legislative Documents, 20th Congress, No. 117, p. 90.) [The decrease in now far
greater, and is verging on extinction. See page 360 of this volume.]]
When the Indians were the sole inhabitants of the wilds from whence they have
since been expelled, their wants were few. Their arms were of their own
manufacture, their only drink was the water of the brook, and their clothes
consisted of the skins of animals, whose flesh furnished them with food.
The Europeans introduced amongst the savages of North America fire-arms, ardent
spirits, and iron: they taught them to exchange for manufactured stuffs, the
rough garments which had previously satisfied their untutored simplicity.
Having acquired new tastes, without the arts by which they could be gratified,
the Indians were obliged to have recourse to the workmanship of the whites; but
in return for their productions the savage had nothing to offer except the rich
furs which still abounded in his woods. Hence the chase became necessary, not
merely to provide for his subsistence, but in order to procure the only objects
of barter which he could furnish to Europe. *c Whilst the wants of the natives
were thus increasing, their resources continued to diminish.
c 
[ Messrs. Clarke and Cass, in their Report to Congress on February 4, 1829, p.
23, expressed themselves thus:—“The time when the Indians generally
could supply themselves with food and clothing, without any of the articles of
civilized life, has long since passed away. The more remote tribes, beyond the
Mississippi, who live where immense herds of buffalo are yet to be found and
who follow those animals in their periodical migrations, could more easily than
any others recur to the habits of their ancestors, and live without the white
man or any of his manufactures. But the buffalo is constantly receding. The
smaller animals, the bear, the deer, the beaver, the otter, the muskrat, etc.,
principally minister to the comfort and support of the Indians; and these
cannot be taken without guns, ammunition, and traps. Among the Northwestern
Indians particularly, the labor of supplying a family with food is excessive.
Day after day is spent by the hunter without success, and during this interval
his family must subsist upon bark or roots, or perish. Want and misery are
around them and among them. Many die every winter from actual
starvation.”
The Indians will not live as Europeans live, and yet they can neither subsist
without them, nor exactly after the fashion of their fathers. This is
demonstrated by a fact which I likewise give upon official authority. Some
Indians of a tribe on the banks of Lake Superior had killed a European; the
American government interdicted all traffic with the tribe to which the guilty
parties belonged, until they were delivered up to justice. This measure had the
desired effect.]
From the moment when a European settlement is formed in the neighborhood of the
territory occupied by the Indians, the beasts of chase take the alarm. *d
Thousands of savages, wandering in the forests and destitute of any fixed
dwelling, did not disturb them; but as soon as the continuous sounds of
European labor are heard in their neighborhood, they begin to flee away, and
retire to the West, where their instinct teaches them that they will find
deserts of immeasurable extent. “The buffalo is constantly
receding,” say Messrs. Clarke and Cass in their Report of the year 1829;
“a few years since they approached the base of the Alleghany; and a few
years hence they may even be rare upon the immense plains which extend to the
base of the Rocky Mountains.” I have been assured that this effect of the
approach of the whites is often felt at two hundred leagues’ distance
from their frontier. Their influence is thus exerted over tribes whose name is
unknown to them; and who suffer the evils of usurpation long before they are
acquainted with the authors of their distress. *e
d 
[ “Five years ago,” (says Volney in his “Tableau des
Etats-Unis,” p. 370) “in going from Vincennes to Kaskaskia, a
territory which now forms part of the State of Illinois, but which at the time
I mention was completely wild (1797), you could not cross a prairie without
seeing herds of from four to five hundred buffaloes. There are now none
remaining; they swam across the Mississippi to escape from the hunters, and
more particularly from the bells of the American cows.”]
e 
[ The truth of what I here advance may be easily proved by consulting the
tabular statement of Indian tribes inhabiting the United States and their
territories. (Legislative Documents, 20th Congress, No. 117, pp. 90-105.) It is
there shown that the tribes in the centre of America are rapidly decreasing,
although the Europeans are still at a considerable distance from them.]
Bold adventurers soon penetrate into the country the Indians have deserted, and
when they have advanced about fifteen or twenty leagues from the extreme
frontiers of the whites, they begin to build habitations for civilized beings
in the midst of the wilderness. This is done without difficulty, as the
territory of a hunting-nation is ill-defined; it is the common property of the
tribe, and belongs to no one in particular, so that individual interests are
not concerned in the protection of any part of it.
A few European families, settled in different situations at a considerable
distance from each other, soon drive away the wild animals which remain between
their places of abode. The Indians, who had previously lived in a sort of
abundance, then find it difficult to subsist, and still more difficult to
procure the articles of barter which they stand in need of.
To drive away their game is to deprive them of the means of existence, as
effectually as if the fields of our agriculturists were stricken with
barrenness; and they are reduced, like famished wolves, to prowl through the
forsaken woods in quest of prey. Their instinctive love of their country
attaches them to the soil which gave them birth, *f even after it has ceased to
yield anything but misery and death. At length they are compelled to acquiesce,
and to depart: they follow the traces of the elk, the buffalo, and the beaver,
and are guided by these wild animals in the choice of their future country.
Properly speaking, therefore, it is not the Europeans who drive away the native
inhabitants of America; it is famine which compels them to recede; a happy
distinction which had escaped the casuists of former times, and for which we
are indebted to modern discovery!
f 
[ “The Indians,” say Messrs. Clarke and Cass in their Report to
Congress, p. 15, “are attached to their country by the same feelings
which bind us to ours; and, besides, there are certain superstitious notions
connected with the alienation of what the Great Spirit gave to their ancestors,
which operate strongly upon the tribes who have made few or no cessions, but
which are gradually weakened as our intercourse with them is extended.
‘We will not sell the spot which contains the bones of our
fathers,’ is almost always the first answer to a proposition for a
sale.”]
It is impossible to conceive the extent of the sufferings which attend these
forced emigrations. They are undertaken by a people already exhausted and
reduced; and the countries to which the newcomers betake themselves are
inhabited by other tribes which receive them with jealous hostility. Hunger is
in the rear; war awaits them, and misery besets them on all sides. In the hope
of escaping from such a host of enemies, they separate, and each individual
endeavors to procure the means of supporting his existence in solitude and
secrecy, living in the immensity of the desert like an outcast in civilized
society. The social tie, which distress had long since weakened, is then
dissolved; they have lost their country, and their people soon desert them:
their very families are obliterated; the names they bore in common are
forgotten, their language perishes, and all traces of their origin disappear.
Their nation has ceased to exist, except in the recollection of the antiquaries
of America and a few of the learned of Europe.
I should be sorry to have my reader suppose that I am coloring the picture too
highly; I saw with my own eyes several of the cases of misery which I have been
describing; and I was the witness of sufferings which I have not the power to
portray.
At the end of the year 1831, whilst I was on the left bank of the Mississippi
at a place named by Europeans, Memphis, there arrived a numerous band of
Choctaws (or Chactas, as they are called by the French in Louisiana). These
savages had left their country, and were endeavoring to gain the right bank of
the Mississippi, where they hoped to find an asylum which had been promised
them by the American government. It was then the middle of winter, and the cold
was unusually severe; the snow had frozen hard upon the ground, and the river
was drifting huge masses of ice. The Indians had their families with them; and
they brought in their train the wounded and sick, with children newly born, and
old men upon the verge of death. They possessed neither tents nor wagons, but
only their arms and some provisions. I saw them embark to pass the mighty
river, and never will that solemn spectacle fade from my remembrance. No cry,
no sob was heard amongst the assembled crowd; all were silent. Their calamities
were of ancient date, and they knew them to be irremediable. The Indians had
all stepped into the bark which was to carry them across, but their dogs
remained upon the bank. As soon as these animals perceived that their masters
were finally leaving the shore, they set up a dismal howl, and, plunging all
together into the icy waters of the Mississippi, they swam after the boat.
The ejectment of the Indians very often takes place at the present day, in a
regular, and, as it were, a legal manner. When the European population begins
to approach the limit of the desert inhabited by a savage tribe, the government
of the United States usually dispatches envoys to them, who assemble the
Indians in a large plain, and having first eaten and drunk with them, accost
them in the following manner: “What have you to do in the land of your
fathers? Before long, you must dig up their bones in order to live. In what
respect is the country you inhabit better than another? Are there no woods,
marshes, or prairies, except where you dwell? And can you live nowhere but
under your own sun? Beyond those mountains which you see at the horizon, beyond
the lake which bounds your territory on the west, there lie vast countries
where beasts of chase are found in great abundance; sell your lands to us, and
go to live happily in those solitudes.” After holding this language, they
spread before the eyes of the Indians firearms, woollen garments, kegs of
brandy, glass necklaces, bracelets of tinsel, earrings, and looking-glasses. *g
If, when they have beheld all these riches, they still hesitate, it is
insinuated that they have not the means of refusing their required consent, and
that the government itself will not long have the power of protecting them in
their rights. What are they to do? Half convinced, and half compelled, they go
to inhabit new deserts, where the importunate whites will not let them remain
ten years in tranquillity. In this manner do the Americans obtain, at a very
low price, whole provinces, which the richest sovereigns of Europe could not
purchase. *h
g 
[ See, in the Legislative Documents of Congress (Doc. 117), the narrative of
what takes place on these occasions. This curious passage is from the
above-mentioned report, made to Congress by Messrs. Clarke and Cass in
February, 1829. Mr. Cass is now the Secretary of War.
“The Indians,” says the report, “reach the treaty-ground poor
and almost naked. Large quantities of goods are taken there by the traders, and
are seen and examined by the Indians. The women and children become importunate
to have their wants supplied, and their influence is soon exerted to induce a
sale. Their improvidence is habitual and unconquerable. The gratification of
his immediate wants and desires is the ruling passion of an Indian. The
expectation of future advantages seldom produces much effect. The experience of
the past is lost, and the prospects of the future disregarded. It would be
utterly hopeless to demand a cession of land, unless the means were at hand of
gratifying their immediate wants; and when their condition and circumstances
are fairly considered, it ought not to surprise us that they are so anxious to
relieve themselves.”]
h 
[ On May 19, 1830, Mr. Edward Everett affirmed before the House of
Representatives, that the Americans had already acquired by treaty, to the east
and west of the Mississippi, 230,000,000 of acres. In 1808 the Osages gave up
48,000,000 acres for an annual payment of $1,000. In 1818 the Quapaws yielded
up 29,000,000 acres for $4,000. They reserved for themselves a territory of
1,000,000 acres for a hunting-ground. A solemn oath was taken that it should be
respected: but before long it was invaded like the rest. Mr. Bell, in his
Report of the Committee on Indian Affairs, February 24, 1830, has these
words:—“To pay an Indian tribe what their ancient hunting-grounds
are worth to them, after the game is fled or destroyed, as a mode of
appropriating wild lands claimed by Indians, has been found more convenient,
and certainly it is more agreeable to the forms of justice, as well as more
merciful, than to assert the possession of them by the sword. Thus the practice
of buying Indian titles is but the substitute which humanity and expediency
have imposed, in place of the sword, in arriving at the actual enjoyment of
property claimed by the right of discovery, and sanctioned by the natural
superiority allowed to the claims of civilized communities over those of savage
tribes. Up to the present time so invariable has been the operation of certain
causes, first in diminishing the value of forest lands to the Indians, and
secondly in disposing them to sell readily, that the plan of buying their right
of occupancy has never threatened to retard, in any perceptible degree, the
prosperity of any of the States.” (Legislative Documents, 21st Congress,
No. 227, p. 6.)]
These are great evils; and it must be added that they appear to me to be
irremediable. I believe that the Indian nations of North America are doomed to
perish; and that whenever the Europeans shall be established on the shores of
the Pacific Ocean, that race of men will be no more. *i The Indians had only
the two alternatives of war or civilization; in other words, they must either
have destroyed the Europeans or become their equals.
i 
[ This seems, indeed, to be the opinion of almost all American statesmen.
“Judging of the future by the past,” says Mr. Cass, “we
cannot err in anticipating a progressive diminution of their numbers, and their
eventual extinction, unless our border should become stationary, and they be
removed beyond it, or unless some radical change should take place in the
principles of our intercourse with them, which it is easier to hope for than to
expect.”]
At the first settlement of the colonies they might have found it possible, by
uniting their forces, to deliver themselves from the small bodies of strangers
who landed on their continent. *j They several times attempted to do it, and
were on the point of succeeding; but the disproportion of their resources, at
the present day, when compared with those of the whites, is too great to allow
such an enterprise to be thought of. Nevertheless, there do arise from time to
time among the Indians men of penetration, who foresee the final destiny which
awaits the native population, and who exert themselves to unite all the tribes
in common hostility to the Europeans; but their efforts are unavailing. Those
tribes which are in the neighborhood of the whites, are too much weakened to
offer an effectual resistance; whilst the others, giving way to that childish
carelessness of the morrow which characterizes savage life, wait for the near
approach of danger before they prepare to meet it; some are unable, the others
are unwilling, to exert themselves.
j 
[ Amongst other warlike enterprises, there was one of the Wampanaogs, and other
confederate tribes, under Metacom in 1675, against the colonists of New
England; the English were also engaged in war in Virginia in 1622.]
It is easy to foresee that the Indians will never conform to civilization; or
that it will be too late, whenever they may be inclined to make the experiment.
Civilization is the result of a long social process which takes place in the
same spot, and is handed down from one generation to another, each one
profiting by the experience of the last. Of all nations, those submit to
civilization with the most difficulty which habitually live by the chase.
Pastoral tribes, indeed, often change their place of abode; but they follow a
regular order in their migrations, and often return again to their old
stations, whilst the dwelling of the hunter varies with that of the animals he
pursues.
Several attempts have been made to diffuse knowledge amongst the Indians,
without controlling their wandering propensities; by the Jesuits in Canada, and
by the Puritans in New England; *k but none of these endeavors were crowned by
any lasting success. Civilization began in the cabin, but it soon retired to
expire in the woods. The great error of these legislators of the Indians was
their not understanding that, in order to succeed in civilizing a people, it is
first necessary to fix it; which cannot be done without inducing it to
cultivate the soil; the Indians ought in the first place to have been
accustomed to agriculture. But not only are they destitute of this
indispensable preliminary to civilization, they would even have great
difficulty in acquiring it. Men who have once abandoned themselves to the
restless and adventurous life of the hunter, feel an insurmountable disgust for
the constant and regular labor which tillage requires. We see this proved in
the bosom of our own society; but it is far more visible among peoples whose
partiality for the chase is a part of their national character.
k 
[ See the “Histoire de la Nouvelle France,” by Charlevoix, and the
work entitled “Lettres edifiantes.”]
Independently of this general difficulty, there is another, which applies
peculiarly to the Indians; they consider labor not merely as an evil, but as a
disgrace; so that their pride prevents them from becoming civilized, as much as
their indolence. *l
l 
[ “In all the tribes,” says Volney, in his “Tableau des
Etats-Unis,” p. 423, “there still exists a generation of old
warriors, who cannot forbear, when they see their countrymen using the hoe,
from exclaiming against the degradation of ancient manners, and asserting that
the savages owe their decline to these innovations; adding, that they have only
to return to their primitive habits in order to recover their power and their
glory.”]
There is no Indian so wretched as not to retain under his hut of bark a lofty
idea of his personal worth; he considers the cares of industry and labor as
degrading occupations; he compares the husbandman to the ox which traces the
furrow; and even in our most ingenious handicraft, he can see nothing but the
labor of slaves. Not that he is devoid of admiration for the power and
intellectual greatness of the whites; but although the result of our efforts
surprises him, he contemns the means by which we obtain it; and while he
acknowledges our ascendancy, he still believes in his superiority. War and
hunting are the only pursuits which appear to him worthy to be the occupations
of a man. *m The Indian, in the dreary solitude of his woods, cherishes the
same ideas, the same opinions as the noble of the Middle Ages in his castle,
and he only requires to become a conqueror to complete the resemblance; thus,
however strange it may seem, it is in the forests of the New World, and not
amongst the Europeans who people its coasts, that the ancient prejudices of
Europe are still in existence.
m 
[ The following description occurs in an official document: “Until a
young man has been engaged with an enemy, and has performed some acts of valor,
he gains no consideration, but is regarded nearly as a woman. In their great
war-dances all the warriors in succession strike the post, as it is called, and
recount their exploits. On these occasions their auditory consists of the
kinsmen, friends, and comrades of the narrator. The profound impression which
his discourse produces on them is manifested by the silent attention it
receives, and by the loud shouts which hail its termination. The young man who
finds himself at such a meeting without anything to recount is very unhappy;
and instances have sometimes occurred of young warriors, whose passions had
been thus inflamed, quitting the war-dance suddenly, and going off alone to
seek for trophies which they might exhibit, and adventures which they might be
allowed to relate.”]
More than once, in the course of this work, I have endeavored to explain the
prodigious influence which the social condition appears to exercise upon the
laws and the manners of men; and I beg to add a few words on the same subject.
When I perceive the resemblance which exists between the political institutions
of our ancestors, the Germans, and of the wandering tribes of North America;
between the customs described by Tacitus, and those of which I have sometimes
been a witness, I cannot help thinking that the same cause has brought about
the same results in both hemispheres; and that in the midst of the apparent
diversity of human affairs, a certain number of primary facts may be
discovered, from which all the others are derived. In what we usually call the
German institutions, then, I am inclined only to perceive barbarian habits; and
the opinions of savages in what we style feudal principles.
However strongly the vices and prejudices of the North American Indians may be
opposed to their becoming agricultural and civilized, necessity sometimes
obliges them to it. Several of the Southern nations, and amongst others the
Cherokees and the Creeks, *n were surrounded by Europeans, who had landed on
the shores of the Atlantic; and who, either descending the Ohio or proceeding
up the Mississippi, arrived simultaneously upon their borders. These tribes
have not been driven from place to place, like their Northern brethren; but
they have been gradually enclosed within narrow limits, like the game within
the thicket, before the huntsmen plunge into the interior. The Indians who were
thus placed between civilization and death, found themselves obliged to live by
ignominious labor like the whites. They took to agriculture, and without
entirely forsaking their old habits or manners, sacrificed only as much as was
necessary to their existence.
n 
[ These nations are now swallowed up in the States of Georgia, Tennessee,
Alabama, and Mississippi. There were formerly in the South four great nations
(remnants of which still exist), the Choctaws, the Chickasaws, the Creeks, and
the Cherokees. The remnants of these four nations amounted, in 1830, to about
75,000 individuals. It is computed that there are now remaining in the
territory occupied or claimed by the Anglo-American Union about 300,000
Indians. (See Proceedings of the Indian Board in the City of New York.) The
official documents supplied to Congress make the number amount to 313,130. The
reader who is curious to know the names and numerical strength of all the
tribes which inhabit the Anglo-American territory should consult the documents
I refer to. (Legislative Documents, 20th Congress, No. 117, pp. 90-105.) [In
the Census of 1870 it is stated that the Indian population of the United States
is only 25,731, of whom 7,241 are in California.]]
The Cherokees went further; they created a written language; established a
permanent form of government; and as everything proceeds rapidly in the New
World, before they had all of them clothes, they set up a newspaper. *o
o 
[ I brought back with me to France one or two copies of this singular
publication.]
The growth of European habits has been remarkably accelerated among these
Indians by the mixed race which has sprung up. *p Deriving intelligence from
their father’s side, without entirely losing the savage customs of the
mother, the half-blood forms the natural link between civilization and
barbarism. Wherever this race has multiplied the savage state has become
modified, and a great change has taken place in the manners of the people. *q
p 
[ See in the Report of the Committee on Indian Affairs, 21st Congress, No. 227,
p. 23, the reasons for the multiplication of Indians of mixed blood among the
Cherokees. The principal cause dates from the War of Independence. Many
Anglo-Americans of Georgia, having taken the side of England, were obliged to
retreat among the Indians, where they married.]
q 
[ Unhappily the mixed race has been less numerous and less influential in North
America than in any other country. The American continent was peopled by two
great nations of Europe, the French and the English. The former were not slow
in connecting themselves with the daughters of the natives, but there was an
unfortunate affinity between the Indian character and their own: instead of
giving the tastes and habits of civilized life to the savages, the French too
often grew passionately fond of the state of wild freedom they found them in.
They became the most dangerous of the inhabitants of the desert, and won the
friendship of the Indian by exaggerating his vices and his virtues. M. de
Senonville, the governor of Canada, wrote thus to Louis XIV in 1685: “It
has long been believed that in order to civilize the savages we ought to draw
them nearer to us. But there is every reason to suppose we have been mistaken.
Those which have been brought into contact with us have not become French, and
the French who have lived among them are changed into savages, affecting to
dress and live like them.” (“History of New France,” by
Charlevoix, vol. ii., p. 345.) The Englishman, on the contrary, continuing
obstinately attached to the customs and the most insignificant habits of his
forefathers, has remained in the midst of the American solitudes just what he
was in the bosom of European cities; he would not allow of any communication
with savages whom he despised, and avoided with care the union of his race with
theirs. Thus while the French exercised no salutary influence over the Indians,
the English have always remained alien from them.]
The success of the Cherokees proves that the Indians are capable of
civilization, but it does not prove that they will succeed in it. This
difficulty which the Indians find in submitting to civilization proceeds from
the influence of a general cause, which it is almost impossible for them to
escape. An attentive survey of history demonstrates that, in general, barbarous
nations have raised themselves to civilization by degrees, and by their own
efforts. Whenever they derive knowledge from a foreign people, they stood
towards it in the relation of conquerors, and not of a conquered nation. When
the conquered nation is enlightened, and the conquerors are half savage, as in
the case of the invasion of Rome by the Northern nations or that of China by
the Mongols, the power which victory bestows upon the barbarian is sufficient
to keep up his importance among civilized men, and permit him to rank as their
equal, until he becomes their rival: the one has might on his side, the other
has intelligence; the former admires the knowledge and the arts of the
conquered, the latter envies the power of the conquerors. The barbarians at
length admit civilized man into their palaces, and he in turn opens his schools
to the barbarians. But when the side on which the physical force lies, also
possesses an intellectual preponderance, the conquered party seldom become
civilized; it retreats, or is destroyed. It may therefore be said, in a general
way, that savages go forth in arms to seek knowledge, but that they do not
receive it when it comes to them.
If the Indian tribes which now inhabit the heart of the continent could summon
up energy enough to attempt to civilize themselves, they might possibly
succeed. Superior already to the barbarous nations which surround them, they
would gradually gain strength and experience, and when the Europeans should
appear upon their borders, they would be in a state, if not to maintain their
independence, at least to assert their right to the soil, and to incorporate
themselves with the conquerors. But it is the misfortune of Indians to be
brought into contact with a civilized people, which is also (it must be owned)
the most avaricious nation on the globe, whilst they are still semi-barbarian:
to find despots in their instructors, and to receive knowledge from the hand of
oppression. Living in the freedom of the woods, the North American Indian was
destitute, but he had no feeling of inferiority towards anyone; as soon,
however, as he desires to penetrate into the social scale of the whites, he
takes the lowest rank in society, for he enters, ignorant and poor, within the
pale of science and wealth. After having led a life of agitation, beset with
evils and dangers, but at the same time filled with proud emotions, *r he is
obliged to submit to a wearisome, obscure, and degraded state; and to gain the
bread which nourishes him by hard and ignoble labor; such are in his eyes the
only results of which civilization can boast: and even this much he is not sure
to obtain.
r 
[ There is in the adventurous life of the hunter a certain irresistible charm,
which seizes the heart of man and carries him away in spite of reason and
experience. This is plainly shown by the memoirs of Tanner. Tanner is a
European who was carried away at the age of six by the Indians, and has
remained thirty years with them in the woods. Nothing can be conceived more
appalling that the miseries which he describes. He tells us of tribes without a
chief, families without a nation to call their own, men in a state of
isolation, wrecks of powerful tribes wandering at random amid the ice and snow
and desolate solitudes of Canada. Hunger and cold pursue them; every day their
life is in jeopardy. Amongst these men, manners have lost their empire,
traditions are without power. They become more and more savage. Tanner shared
in all these miseries; he was aware of his European origin; he was not kept
away from the whites by force; on the contrary, he came every year to trade
with them, entered their dwellings, and witnessed their enjoyments; he knew
that whenever he chose to return to civilized life he was perfectly able to do
so—and he remained thirty years in the deserts. When he came into
civilized society he declared that the rude existence which he described, had a
secret charm for him which he was unable to define: he returned to it again and
again: at length he abandoned it with poignant regret; and when he was at
length fixed among the whites, several of his children refused to share his
tranquil and easy situation. I saw Tanner myself at the lower end of Lake
Superior; he seemed to me to be more like a savage than a civilized being. His
book is written without either taste or order; but he gives, even
unconsciously, a lively picture of the prejudices, the passions, the vices,
and, above all, of the destitution in which he lived.]
When the Indians undertake to imitate their European neighbors, and to till the
earth like the settlers, they are immediately exposed to a very formidable
competition. The white man is skilled in the craft of agriculture; the Indian
is a rough beginner in an art with which he is unacquainted. The former reaps
abundant crops without difficulty, the latter meets with a thousand obstacles
in raising the fruits of the earth.
The European is placed amongst a population whose wants he knows and partakes.
The savage is isolated in the midst of a hostile people, with whose manners,
language, and laws he is imperfectly acquainted, but without whose assistance
he cannot live. He can only procure the materials of comfort by bartering his
commodities against the goods of the European, for the assistance of his
countrymen is wholly insufficient to supply his wants. When the Indian wishes
to sell the produce of his labor, he cannot always meet with a purchaser,
whilst the European readily finds a market; and the former can only produce at
a considerable cost that which the latter vends at a very low rate. Thus the
Indian has no sooner escaped those evils to which barbarous nations are
exposed, than he is subjected to the still greater miseries of civilized
communities; and he finds is scarcely less difficult to live in the midst of
our abundance, than in the depth of his own wilderness.
He has not yet lost the habits of his erratic life; the traditions of his
fathers and his passion for the chase are still alive within him. The wild
enjoyments which formerly animated him in the woods, painfully excite his
troubled imagination; and his former privations appear to be less keen, his
former perils less appalling. He contrasts the independence which he possessed
amongst his equals with the servile position which he occupies in civilized
society. On the other hand, the solitudes which were so long his free home are
still at hand; a few hours’ march will bring him back to them once more.
The whites offer him a sum, which seems to him to be considerable, for the
ground which he has begun to clear. This money of the Europeans may possibly
furnish him with the means of a happy and peaceful subsistence in remoter
regions; and he quits the plough, resumes his native arms, and returns to the
wilderness forever. *s The condition of the Creeks and Cherokees, to which I
have already alluded, sufficiently corroborates the truth of this deplorable
picture.
s 
[ The destructive influence of highly civilized nations upon others which are
less so, has been exemplified by the Europeans themselves. About a century ago
the French founded the town of Vincennes up on the Wabash, in the middle of the
desert; and they lived there in great plenty until the arrival of the American
settlers, who first ruined the previous inhabitants by their competition, and
afterwards purchased their lands at a very low rate. At the time when M. de
Volney, from whom I borrow these details, passed through Vincennes, the number
of the French was reduced to a hundred individuals, most of whom were about to
pass over to Louisiana or to Canada. These French settlers were worthy people,
but idle and uninstructed: they had contracted many of the habits of savages.
The Americans, who were perhaps their inferiors, in a moral point of view, were
immeasurably superior to them in intelligence: they were industrious, well
informed, rich, and accustomed to govern their own community.
I myself saw in Canada, where the intellectual difference between the two races
is less striking, that the English are the masters of commerce and manufacture
in the Canadian country, that they spread on all sides, and confine the French
within limits which scarcely suffice to contain them. In like manner, in
Louisiana, almost all activity in commerce and manufacture centres in the hands
of the Anglo-Americans.
But the case of Texas is still more striking: the State of Texas is a part of
Mexico, and lies upon the frontier between that country and the United States.
In the course of the last few years the Anglo-Americans have penetrated into
this province, which is still thinly peopled; they purchase land, they produce
the commodities of the country, and supplant the original population. It may
easily be foreseen that if Mexico takes no steps to check this change, the
province of Texas will very shortly cease to belong to that government.
If the different degrees—comparatively so slight—which exist in
European civilization produce results of such magnitude, the consequences which
must ensue from the collision of the most perfect European civilization with
Indian savages may readily be conceived.]
The Indians, in the little which they have done, have unquestionably displayed
as much natural genius as the peoples of Europe in their most important
designs; but nations as well as men require time to learn, whatever may be
their intelligence and their zeal. Whilst the savages were engaged in the work
of civilization, the Europeans continued to surround them on every side, and to
confine them within narrower limits; the two races gradually met, and they are
now in immediate juxtaposition to each other. The Indian is already superior to
his barbarous parent, but he is still very far below his white neighbor. With
their resources and acquired knowledge, the Europeans soon appropriated to
themselves most of the advantages which the natives might have derived from the
possession of the soil; they have settled in the country, they have purchased
land at a very low rate or have occupied it by force, and the Indians have been
ruined by a competition which they had not the means of resisting. They were
isolated in their own country, and their race only constituted a colony of
troublesome aliens in the midst of a numerous and domineering people. *t
t 
[ See in the Legislative Documents (21st Congress, No. 89) instances of
excesses of every kind committed by the whites upon the territory of the
Indians, either in taking possession of a part of their lands, until compelled
to retire by the troops of Congress, or carrying off their cattle, burning
their houses, cutting down their corn, and doing violence to their persons. It
appears, nevertheless, from all these documents that the claims of the natives
are constantly protected by the government from the abuse of force. The Union
has a representative agent continually employed to reside among the Indians;
and the report of the Cherokee agent, which is among the documents I have
referred to, is almost always favorable to the Indians. “The intrusion of
whites,” he says, “upon the lands of the Cherokees would cause ruin
to the poor, helpless, and inoffensive inhabitants.” And he further
remarks upon the attempt of the State of Georgia to establish a division line
for the purpose of limiting the boundaries of the Cherokees, that the line
drawn having been made by the whites, and entirely upon ex parte evidence of
their several rights, was of no validity whatever.]
Washington said in one of his messages to Congress, “We are more
enlightened and more powerful than the Indian nations, we are therefore bound
in honor to treat them with kindness and even with generosity.” But this
virtuous and high-minded policy has not been followed. The rapacity of the
settlers is usually backed by the tyranny of the government. Although the
Cherokees and the Creeks are established upon the territory which they
inhabited before the settlement of the Europeans, and although the Americans
have frequently treated with them as with foreign nations, the surrounding
States have not consented to acknowledge them as independent peoples, and
attempts have been made to subject these children of the woods to
Anglo-American magistrates, laws, and customs. *u Destitution had driven these
unfortunate Indians to civilization, and oppression now drives them back to
their former condition: many of them abandon the soil which they had begun to
clear, and return to their savage course of life.
u 
[ In 1829 the State of Alabama divided the Creek territory into counties, and
subjected the Indian population to the power of European magistrates.
In 1830 the State of Mississippi assimilated the Choctaws and Chickasaws to the
white population, and declared that any of them that should take the title of
chief would be punished by a fine of $1,000 and a year’s imprisonment.
When these laws were enforced upon the Choctaws, who inhabited that district,
the tribe assembled, their chief communicated to them the intentions of the
whites, and read to them some of the laws to which it was intended that they
should submit; and they unanimously declared that it was better at once to
retreat again into the wilds.]
If we consider the tyrannical measures which have been adopted by the
legislatures of the Southern States, the conduct of their Governors, and the
decrees of their courts of justice, we shall be convinced that the entire
expulsion of the Indians is the final result to which the efforts of their
policy are directed. The Americans of that part of the Union look with jealousy
upon the aborigines, *v they are aware that these tribes have not yet lost the
traditions of savage life, and before civilization has permanently fixed them
to the soil, it is intended to force them to recede by reducing them to
despair. The Creeks and Cherokees, oppressed by the several States, have
appealed to the central government, which is by no means insensible to their
misfortunes, and is sincerely desirous of saving the remnant of the natives,
and of maintaining them in the free possession of that territory, which the
Union is pledged to respect. *w But the several States oppose so formidable a
resistance to the execution of this design, that the government is obliged to
consent to the extirpation of a few barbarous tribes in order not to endanger
the safety of the American Union.
v 
[ The Georgians, who are so much annoyed by the proximity of the Indians,
inhabit a territory which does not at present contain more than seven
inhabitants to the square mile. In France there are one hundred and sixty-two
inhabitants to the same extent of country.]
w 
[ In 1818 Congress appointed commissioners to visit the Arkansas Territory,
accompanied by a deputation of Creeks, Choctaws, and Chickasaws. This
expedition was commanded by Messrs. Kennerly, M’Coy, Wash Hood, and John
Bell. See the different reports of the commissioners, and their journal, in the
Documents of Congress, No. 87, House of Representatives.]
But the federal government, which is not able to protect the Indians, would
fain mitigate the hardships of their lot; and, with this intention, proposals
have been made to transport them into more remote regions at the public cost.
Between the thirty-third and thirty-seventh degrees of north latitude, a vast
tract of country lies, which has taken the name of Arkansas, from the principal
river that waters its extent. It is bounded on the one side by the confines of
Mexico, on the other by the Mississippi. Numberless streams cross it in every
direction; the climate is mild, and the soil productive, but it is only
inhabited by a few wandering hordes of savages. The government of the Union
wishes to transport the broken remnants of the indigenous population of the
South to the portion of this country which is nearest to Mexico, and at a great
distance from the American settlements.
We were assured, towards the end of the year 1831, that 10,000 Indians had
already gone down to the shores of the Arkansas; and fresh detachments were
constantly following them; but Congress has been unable to excite a unanimous
determination in those whom it is disposed to protect. Some, indeed, are
willing to quit the seat of oppression, but the most enlightened members of the
community refuse to abandon their recent dwellings and their springing crops;
they are of opinion that the work of civilization, once interrupted, will never
be resumed; they fear that those domestic habits which have been so recently
contracted, may be irrevocably lost in the midst of a country which is still
barbarous, and where nothing is prepared for the subsistence of an agricultural
people; they know that their entrance into those wilds will be opposed by
inimical hordes, and that they have lost the energy of barbarians, without
acquiring the resources of civilization to resist their attacks. Moreover, the
Indians readily discover that the settlement which is proposed to them is
merely a temporary expedient. Who can assure them that they will at length be
allowed to dwell in peace in their new retreat? The United States pledge
themselves to the observance of the obligation; but the territory which they at
present occupy was formerly secured to them by the most solemn oaths of
Anglo-American faith. *x The American government does not indeed rob them of
their lands, but it allows perpetual incursions to be made on them. In a few
years the same white population which now flocks around them, will track them
to the solitudes of the Arkansas; they will then be exposed to the same evils
without the same remedies, and as the limits of the earth will at last fail
them, their only refuge is the grave.
x 
[ The fifth article of the treaty made with the Creeks in August, 1790, is in
the following words:—“The United States solemnly guarantee to the
Creek nation all their land within the limits of the United States.”
The seventh article of the treaty concluded in 1791 with the Cherokees
says:—“The United States solemnly guarantee to the Cherokee nation
all their lands not hereby ceded.” The following article declared that if
any citizen of the United States or other settler not of the Indian race should
establish himself upon the territory of the Cherokees, the United States would
withdraw their protection from that individual, and give him up to be punished
as the Cherokee nation should think fit.]
The Union treats the Indians with less cupidity and rigor than the policy of
the several States, but the two governments are alike destitute of good faith.
The States extend what they are pleased to term the benefits of their laws to
the Indians, with a belief that the tribes will recede rather than submit; and
the central government, which promises a permanent refuge to these unhappy
beings is well aware of its inability to secure it to them. *y
y 
[ This does not prevent them from promising in the most solemn manner to do so.
See the letter of the President addressed to the Creek Indians, March 23, 1829
(Proceedings of the Indian Board, in the city of New York, p. 5): “Beyond
the great river Mississippi, where a part of your nation has gone, your father
has provided a country large enough for all of you, and he advises you to
remove to it. There your white brothers will not trouble you; they will have no
claim to the land, and you can live upon it, you and all your children, as long
as the grass grows, or the water runs, in peace and plenty. It will be yours
forever.”
The Secretary of War, in a letter written to the Cherokees, April 18, 1829,
(see the same work, p. 6), declares to them that they cannot expect to retain
possession of the lands at that time occupied by them, but gives them the most
positive assurance of uninterrupted peace if they would remove beyond the
Mississippi: as if the power which could not grant them protection then, would
be able to afford it them hereafter!]
Thus the tyranny of the States obliges the savages to retire, the Union, by its
promises and resources, facilitates their retreat; and these measures tend to
precisely the same end. *z “By the will of our Father in Heaven, the
Governor of the whole world,” said the Cherokees in their petition to
Congress, *a “the red man of America has become small, and the white man
great and renowned. When the ancestors of the people of these United States
first came to the shores of America they found the red man strong: though he
was ignorant and savage, yet he received them kindly, and gave them dry land to
rest their weary feet. They met in peace, and shook hands in token of
friendship. Whatever the white man wanted and asked of the Indian, the latter
willingly gave. At that time the Indian was the lord, and the white man the
suppliant. But now the scene has changed. The strength of the red man has
become weakness. As his neighbors increased in numbers his power became less
and less, and now, of the many and powerful tribes who once covered these
United States, only a few are to be seen—a few whom a sweeping pestilence
has left. The northern tribes, who were once so numerous and powerful, are now
nearly extinct. Thus it has happened to the red man of America. Shall we, who
are remnants, share the same fate?”
z 
[ To obtain a correct idea of the policy pursued by the several States and the
Union with respect to the Indians, it is necessary to consult, 1st, “The
Laws of the Colonial and State Governments relating to the Indian
Inhabitants.” (See the Legislative Documents, 21st Congress, No. 319.)
2d, The Laws of the Union on the same subject, and especially that of March 30,
1802. (See Story’s “Laws of the United States.”) 3d, The
Report of Mr. Cass, Secretary of War, relative to Indian Affairs, November 29,
1823.]
a 
[ December 18, 1829.]
“The land on which we stand we have received as an inheritance from our
fathers, who possessed it from time immemorial, as a gift from our common
Father in Heaven. They bequeathed it to us as their children, and we have
sacredly kept it, as containing the remains of our beloved men. This right of
inheritance we have never ceded nor ever forfeited. Permit us to ask what
better right can the people have to a country than the right of inheritance and
immemorial peaceable possession? We know it is said of late by the State of
Georgia and by the Executive of the United States, that we have forfeited this
right; but we think this is said gratuitously. At what time have we made the
forfeit? What great crime have we committed, whereby we must forever be
divested of our country and rights? Was it when we were hostile to the United
States, and took part with the King of Great Britain, during the struggle for
independence? If so, why was not this forfeiture declared in the first treaty
of peace between the United States and our beloved men? Why was not such an
article as the following inserted in the treaty:—‘The United States
give peace to the Cherokees, but, for the part they took in the late war,
declare them to be but tenants at will, to be removed when the convenience of
the States, within whose chartered limits they live, shall require it’?
That was the proper time to assume such a possession. But it was not thought
of, nor would our forefathers have agreed to any treaty whose tendency was to
deprive them of their rights and their country.”
Such is the language of the Indians: their assertions are true, their
forebodings inevitable. From whichever side we consider the destinies of the
aborigines of North America, their calamities appear to be irremediable: if
they continue barbarous, they are forced to retire; if they attempt to civilize
their manners, the contact of a more civilized community subjects them to
oppression and destitution. They perish if they continue to wander from waste
to waste, and if they attempt to settle they still must perish; the assistance
of Europeans is necessary to instruct them, but the approach of Europeans
corrupts and repels them into savage life; they refuse to change their habits
as long as their solitudes are their own, and it is too late to change them
when they are constrained to submit.
The Spaniards pursued the Indians with bloodhounds, like wild beasts; they
sacked the New World with no more temper or compassion than a city taken by
storm; but destruction must cease, and frenzy be stayed; the remnant of the
Indian population which had escaped the massacre mixed with its conquerors, and
adopted in the end their religion and their manners. *b The conduct of the
Americans of the United States towards the aborigines is characterized, on the
other hand, by a singular attachment to the formalities of law. Provided that
the Indians retain their barbarous condition, the Americans take no part in
their affairs; they treat them as independent nations, and do not possess
themselves of their hunting grounds without a treaty of purchase; and if an
Indian nation happens to be so encroached upon as to be unable to subsist upon
its territory, they afford it brotherly assistance in transporting it to a
grave sufficiently remote from the land of its fathers.
b 
[ The honor of this result is, however, by no means due to the Spaniards. If
the Indian tribes had not been tillers of the ground at the time of the arrival
of the Europeans, they would unquestionably have been destroyed in South as
well as in North America.]
The Spaniards were unable to exterminate the Indian race by those unparalleled
atrocities which brand them with indelible shame, nor did they even succeed in
wholly depriving it of its rights; but the Americans of the United States have
accomplished this twofold purpose with singular felicity; tranquilly, legally,
philanthropically, without shedding blood, and without violating a single great
principle of morality in the eyes of the world. *c It is impossible to destroy
men with more respect for the laws of humanity.
c 
[ See, amongst other documents, the report made by Mr. Bell in the name of the
Committee on Indian Affairs, February 24, 1830, in which is most logically
established and most learnedly proved, that “the fundamental principle
that the Indians had no right by virtue of their ancient possession either of
will or sovereignty, has never been abandoned either expressly or by
implication.” In perusing this report, which is evidently drawn up by an
experienced hand, one is astonished at the facility with which the author gets
rid of all arguments founded upon reason and natural right, which he designates
as abstract and theoretical principles. The more I contemplate the difference
between civilized and uncivilized man with regard to the principles of justice,
the more I observe that the former contests the justice of those rights which
the latter simply violates.]
[I leave this chapter wholly unchanged, for it has always appeared to me to be
one of the most eloquent and touching parts of this book. But it has ceased to
be prophetic; the destruction of the Indian race in the United States is
already consummated. In 1870 there remained but 25,731 Indians in the whole
territory of the Union, and of these by far the largest part exist in
California, Michigan, Wisconsin, Dakota, and New Mexico and Nevada. In New
England, Pennsylvania, and New York the race is extinct; and the predictions of
M. de Tocqueville are fulfilled. —Translator’s Note.]
Situation Of The Black Population In The United States, And Dangers With Which
Its Presence Threatens The Whites
Why it is more difficult to abolish slavery, and to efface all vestiges of it
amongst the moderns than it was amongst the ancients—In the United States
the prejudices of the Whites against the Blacks seem to increase in proportion
as slavery is abolished—Situation of the Negroes in the Northern and
Southern States—Why the Americans abolish slavery—Servitude, which

slavery, whilst they are distressed at its continuance.
The Indians will perish in the same isolated condition in which they have
lived; but the destiny of the negroes is in some measure interwoven with that
of the Europeans. These two races are attached to each other without
intermingling, and they are alike unable entirely to separate or to combine.
The most formidable of all the ills which threaten the future existence of the
Union arises from the presence of a black population upon its territory; and in
contemplating the cause of the present embarrassments or of the future dangers
of the United States, the observer is invariably led to consider this as a
primary fact.
The permanent evils to which mankind is subjected are usually produced by the
vehement or the increasing efforts of men; but there is one calamity which
penetrated furtively into the world, and which was at first scarcely
distinguishable amidst the ordinary abuses of power; it originated with an
individual whose name history has not preserved; it was wafted like some
accursed germ upon a portion of the soil, but it afterwards nurtured itself,
grew without effort, and spreads naturally with the society to which it
belongs. I need scarcely add that this calamity is slavery. Christianity
suppressed slavery, but the Christians of the sixteenth century re-established
it—as an exception, indeed, to their social system, and restricted to one
of the races of mankind; but the wound thus inflicted upon humanity, though
less extensive, was at the same time rendered far more difficult of cure.
It is important to make an accurate distinction between slavery itself and its
consequences. The immediate evils which are produced by slavery were very
nearly the same in antiquity as they are amongst the moderns; but the
consequences of these evils were different. The slave, amongst the ancients,
belonged to the same race as his master, and he was often the superior of the
two in education *d and instruction. Freedom was the only distinction between
them; and when freedom was conferred they were easily confounded together. The
ancients, then, had a very simple means of avoiding slavery and its evil
consequences, which was that of affranchisement; and they succeeded as soon as
they adopted this measure generally. Not but, in ancient States, the vestiges
of servitude subsisted for some time after servitude itself was abolished.
There is a natural prejudice which prompts men to despise whomsoever has been
their inferior long after he is become their equal; and the real inequality
which is produced by fortune or by law is always succeeded by an imaginary
inequality which is implanted in the manners of the people. Nevertheless, this
secondary consequence of slavery was limited to a certain term amongst the
ancients, for the freedman bore so entire a resemblance to those born free,
that it soon became impossible to distinguish him from amongst them.
d 
[ It is well known that several of the most distinguished authors of antiquity,
and amongst them Aesop and Terence, were, or had been slaves. Slaves were not
always taken from barbarous nations, and the chances of war reduced highly
civilized men to servitude.]
The greatest difficulty in antiquity was that of altering the law; amongst the
moderns it is that of altering the manners; and, as far as we are concerned,
the real obstacles begin where those of the ancients left off. This arises from
the circumstance that, amongst the moderns, the abstract and transient fact of
slavery is fatally united to the physical and permanent fact of color. The
tradition of slavery dishonors the race, and the peculiarity of the race
perpetuates the tradition of slavery. No African has ever voluntarily emigrated
to the shores of the New World; whence it must be inferred, that all the blacks
who are now to be found in that hemisphere are either slaves or freedmen. Thus
the negro transmits the eternal mark of his ignominy to all his descendants;
and although the law may abolish slavery, God alone can obliterate the traces
of its existence.
The modern slave differs from his master not only in his condition, but in his
origin. You may set the negro free, but you cannot make him otherwise than an
alien to the European. Nor is this all; we scarcely acknowledge the common
features of mankind in this child of debasement whom slavery has brought
amongst us. His physiognomy is to our eyes hideous, his understanding weak, his
tastes low; and we are almost inclined to look upon him as a being intermediate
between man and the brutes. *e The moderns, then, after they have abolished
slavery, have three prejudices to contend against, which are less easy to
attack and far less easy to conquer than the mere fact of servitude: the
prejudice of the master, the prejudice of the race, and the prejudice of color.
e 
[ To induce the whites to abandon the opinion they have conceived of the moral
and intellectual inferiority of their former slaves, the negroes must change;
but as long as this opinion subsists, to change is impossible.]
It is difficult for us, who have had the good fortune to be born amongst men
like ourselves by nature, and equal to ourselves by law, to conceive the
irreconcilable differences which separate the negro from the European in
America. But we may derive some faint notion of them from analogy. France was
formerly a country in which numerous distinctions of rank existed, that had
been created by the legislation. Nothing can be more fictitious than a purely
legal inferiority; nothing more contrary to the instinct of mankind than these
permanent divisions which had been established between beings evidently
similar. Nevertheless these divisions subsisted for ages; they still subsist in
many places; and on all sides they have left imaginary vestiges, which time
alone can efface. If it be so difficult to root out an inequality which solely
originates in the law, how are those distinctions to be destroyed which seem to
be based upon the immutable laws of Nature herself? When I remember the extreme
difficulty with which aristocratic bodies, of whatever nature they may be, are
commingled with the mass of the people; and the exceeding care which they take
to preserve the ideal boundaries of their caste inviolate, I despair of seeing
an aristocracy disappear which is founded upon visible and indelible signs.
Those who hope that the Europeans will ever mix with the negroes, appear to me
to delude themselves; and I am not led to any such conclusion by my own reason,
or by the evidence of facts.
Hitherto, wherever the whites have been the most powerful, they have maintained
the blacks in a subordinate or a servile position; wherever the negroes have
been strongest they have destroyed the whites; such has been the only
retribution which has ever taken place between the two races.
I see that in a certain portion of the territory of the United States at the
present day, the legal barrier which separated the two races is tending to fall
away, but not that which exists in the manners of the country; slavery recedes,
but the prejudice to which it has given birth remains stationary. Whosoever has
inhabited the United States must have perceived that in those parts of the
Union in which the negroes are no longer slaves, they have in no wise drawn
nearer to the whites. On the contrary, the prejudice of the race appears to be
stronger in the States which have abolished slavery, than in those where it
still exists; and nowhere is it so intolerant as in those States where
servitude has never been known.
It is true, that in the North of the Union, marriages may be legally contracted
between negroes and whites; but public opinion would stigmatize a man who
should connect himself with a negress as infamous, and it would be difficult to
meet with a single instance of such a union. The electoral franchise has been
conferred upon the negroes in almost all the States in which slavery has been
abolished; but if they come forward to vote, their lives are in danger. If
oppressed, they may bring an action at law, but they will find none but whites
amongst their judges; and although they may legally serve as jurors, prejudice
repulses them from that office. The same schools do not receive the child of
the black and of the European. In the theatres, gold cannot procure a seat for
the servile race beside their former masters; in the hospitals they lie apart;
and although they are allowed to invoke the same Divinity as the whites, it
must be at a different altar, and in their own churches, with their own clergy.
The gates of Heaven are not closed against these unhappy beings; but their
inferiority is continued to the very confines of the other world; when the
negro is defunct, his bones are cast aside, and the distinction of condition
prevails even in the equality of death. The negro is free, but he can share
neither the rights, nor the pleasures, nor the labor, nor the afflictions, nor
the tomb of him whose equal he has been declared to be; and he cannot meet him
upon fair terms in life or in death.
In the South, where slavery still exists, the negroes are less carefully kept
apart; they sometimes share the labor and the recreations of the whites; the
whites consent to intermix with them to a certain extent, and although the
legislation treats them more harshly, the habits of the people are more
tolerant and compassionate. In the South the master is not afraid to raise his
slave to his own standing, because he knows that he can in a moment reduce him
to the dust at pleasure. In the North the white no longer distinctly perceives
the barrier which separates him from the degraded race, and he shuns the negro
with the more pertinacity, since he fears lest they should some day be
confounded together.
Amongst the Americans of the South, nature sometimes reasserts her rights, and
restores a transient equality between the blacks and the whites; but in the
North pride restrains the most imperious of human passions. The American of the
Northern States would perhaps allow the negress to share his licentious
pleasures, if the laws of his country did not declare that she may aspire to be
the legitimate partner of his bed; but he recoils with horror from her who
might become his wife.
Thus it is, in the United States, that the prejudice which repels the negroes
seems to increase in proportion as they are emancipated, and inequality is
sanctioned by the manners whilst it is effaced from the laws of the country.
But if the relative position of the two races which inhabit the United States
is such as I have described, it may be asked why the Americans have abolished
slavery in the North of the Union, why they maintain it in the South, and why
they aggravate its hardships there? The answer is easily given. It is not for
the good of the negroes, but for that of the whites, that measures are taken to
abolish slavery in the United States.
The first negroes were imported into Virginia about the year 1621. *f In
America, therefore, as well as in the rest of the globe, slavery originated in
the South. Thence it spread from one settlement to another; but the number of
slaves diminished towards the Northern States, and the negro population was
always very limited in New England. *g
f 
[ See Beverley’s “History of Virginia.” See also in
Jefferson’s “Memoirs” some curious details concerning the
introduction of negroes into Virginia, and the first Act which prohibited the
importation of them in 1778.]
g 
[ The number of slaves was less considerable in the North, but the advantages
resulting from slavery were not more contested there than in the South. In
1740, the Legislature of the State of New York declared that the direct
importation of slaves ought to be encouraged as much as possible, and smuggling
severely punished in order not to discourage the fair trader. (Kent’s
“Commentaries,” vol. ii. p. 206.) Curious researches, by Belknap,
upon slavery in New England, are to be found in the “Historical
Collection of Massachusetts,” vol. iv. p. 193. It appears that negroes
were introduced there in 1630, but that the legislation and manners of the
people were opposed to slavery from the first; see also, in the same work, the
manner in which public opinion, and afterwards the laws, finally put an end to
slavery.]
A century had scarcely elapsed since the foundation of the colonies, when the
attention of the planters was struck by the extraordinary fact, that the
provinces which were comparatively destitute of slaves, increased in
population, in wealth, and in prosperity more rapidly than those which
contained the greatest number of negroes. In the former, however, the
inhabitants were obliged to cultivate the soil themselves, or by hired
laborers; in the latter they were furnished with hands for which they paid no
wages; yet although labor and expenses were on the one side, and ease with
economy on the other, the former were in possession of the most advantageous
system. This consequence seemed to be the more difficult to explain, since the
settlers, who all belonged to the same European race, had the same habits, the
same civilization, the same laws, and their shades of difference were extremely
slight.
Time, however, continued to advance, and the Anglo-Americans, spreading beyond
the coasts of the Atlantic Ocean, penetrated farther and farther into the
solitudes of the West; they met with a new soil and an unwonted climate; the
obstacles which opposed them were of the most various character; their races
intermingled, the inhabitants of the South went up towards the North, those of
the North descended to the South; but in the midst of all these causes, the
same result occurred at every step, and in general, the colonies in which there
were no slaves became more populous and more rich than those in which slavery
flourished. The more progress was made, the more was it shown that slavery,
which is so cruel to the slave, is prejudicial to the master.
But this truth was most satisfactorily demonstrated when civilization reached
the banks of the Ohio. The stream which the Indians had distinguished by the
name of Ohio, or Beautiful River, waters one of the most magnificent valleys
that has ever been made the abode of man. Undulating lands extend upon both
shores of the Ohio, whose soil affords inexhaustible treasures to the laborer;
on either bank the air is wholesome and the climate mild, and each of them
forms the extreme frontier of a vast State: That which follows the numerous
windings of the Ohio upon the left is called Kentucky, that upon the right
bears the name of the river. These two States only differ in a single respect;
Kentucky has admitted slavery, but the State of Ohio has prohibited the
existence of slaves within its borders. *h
h 
[ Not only is slavery prohibited in Ohio, but no free negroes are allowed to
enter the territory of that State, or to hold property in it. See the Statutes
of Ohio.]
Thus the traveller who floats down the current of the Ohio to the spot where
that river falls into the Mississippi, may be said to sail between liberty and
servitude; and a transient inspection of the surrounding objects will convince
him as to which of the two is most favorable to mankind. Upon the left bank of
the stream the population is rare; from time to time one descries a troop of
slaves loitering in the half-desert fields; the primaeval forest recurs at
every turn; society seems to be asleep, man to be idle, and nature alone offers
a scene of activity and of life. From the right bank, on the contrary, a
confused hum is heard which proclaims the presence of industry; the fields are
covered with abundant harvests, the elegance of the dwellings announces the
taste and activity of the laborer, and man appears to be in the enjoyment of
that wealth and contentment which is the reward of labor. *i
i 
[ The activity of Ohio is not confined to individuals, but the undertakings of
the State are surprisingly great; a canal has been established between Lake
Erie and the Ohio, by means of which the valley of the Mississippi communicates
with the river of the North, and the European commodities which arrive at New
York may be forwarded by water to New Orleans across five hundred leagues of
continent.]
The State of Kentucky was founded in 1775, the State of Ohio only twelve years
later; but twelve years are more in America than half a century in Europe, and,
at the present day, the population of Ohio exceeds that of Kentucky by two
hundred and fifty thousand souls. *j These opposite consequences of slavery and
freedom may readily be understood, and they suffice to explain many of the
differences which we remark between the civilization of antiquity and that of
our own time.
j 
[ The exact numbers given by the census of 1830 were: Kentucky, 688,-844; Ohio,
937,679. [In 1890 the population of Ohio was 3,672,316, that of Kentucky,
1,858,635.]]
Upon the left bank of the Ohio labor is confounded with the idea of slavery,
upon the right bank it is identified with that of prosperity and improvement;
on the one side it is degraded, on the other it is honored; on the former
territory no white laborers can be found, for they would be afraid of
assimilating themselves to the negroes; on the latter no one is idle, for the
white population extends its activity and its intelligence to every kind of
employment. Thus the men whose task it is to cultivate the rich soil of
Kentucky are ignorant and lukewarm; whilst those who are active and enlightened
either do nothing or pass over into the State of Ohio, where they may work
without dishonor.
It is true that in Kentucky the planters are not obliged to pay wages to the
slaves whom they employ; but they derive small profits from their labor, whilst
the wages paid to free workmen would be returned with interest in the value of
their services. The free workman is paid, but he does his work quicker than the
slave, and rapidity of execution is one of the great elements of economy. The
white sells his services, but they are only purchased at the times at which
they may be useful; the black can claim no remuneration for his toil, but the
expense of his maintenance is perpetual; he must be supported in his old age as
well as in the prime of manhood, in his profitless infancy as well as in the
productive years of youth. Payment must equally be made in order to obtain the
services of either class of men: the free workman receives his wages in money,
the slave in education, in food, in care, and in clothing. The money which a
master spends in the maintenance of his slaves goes gradually and in detail, so
that it is scarcely perceived; the salary of the free workman is paid in a
round sum, which appears only to enrich the individual who receives it, but in
the end the slave has cost more than the free servant, and his labor is less
productive. *k
k 
[ Independently of these causes, which, wherever free workmen abound, render
their labor more productive and more economical than that of slaves, another
cause may be pointed out which is peculiar to the United States: the sugar-cane
has hitherto been cultivated with success only upon the banks of the
Mississippi, near the mouth of that river in the Gulf of Mexico. In Louisiana
the cultivation of the sugar-cane is exceedingly lucrative, and nowhere does a
laborer earn so much by his work, and, as there is always a certain relation
between the cost of production and the value of the produce, the price of
slaves is very high in Louisiana. But Louisiana is one of the confederated
States, and slaves may be carried thither from all parts of the Union; the
price given for slaves in New Orleans consequently raises the value of slaves
in all the other markets. The consequence of this is, that in the countries
where the land is less productive, the cost of slave labor is still very
considerable, which gives an additional advantage to the competition of free
labor.]
The influence of slavery extends still further; it affects the character of the
master, and imparts a peculiar tendency to his ideas and his tastes. Upon both
banks of the Ohio, the character of the inhabitants is enterprising and
energetic; but this vigor is very differently exercised in the two States. The
white inhabitant of Ohio, who is obliged to subsist by his own exertions,
regards temporal prosperity as the principal aim of his existence; and as the
country which he occupies presents inexhaustible resources to his industry and
ever-varying lures to his activity, his acquisitive ardor surpasses the
ordinary limits of human cupidity: he is tormented by the desire of wealth, and
he boldly enters upon every path which fortune opens to him; he becomes a
sailor, a pioneer, an artisan, or a laborer with the same indifference, and he
supports, with equal constancy, the fatigues and the dangers incidental to
these various professions; the resources of his intelligence are astonishing,
and his avidity in the pursuit of gain amounts to a species of heroism.
But the Kentuckian scorns not only labor, but all the undertakings which labor
promotes; as he lives in an idle independence, his tastes are those of an idle
man; money loses a portion of its value in his eyes; he covets wealth much less
than pleasure and excitement; and the energy which his neighbor devotes to
gain, turns with him to a passionate love of field sports and military
exercises; he delights in violent bodily exertion, he is familiar with the use
of arms, and is accustomed from a very early age to expose his life in single
combat. Thus slavery not only prevents the whites from becoming opulent, but
even from desiring to become so.
As the same causes have been continually producing opposite effects for the
last two centuries in the British colonies of North America, they have
established a very striking difference between the commercial capacity of the
inhabitants of the South and those of the North. At the present day it is only
the Northern States which are in possession of shipping, manufactures,
railroads, and canals. This difference is perceptible not only in comparing the
North with the South, but in comparing the several Southern States. Almost all
the individuals who carry on commercial operations, or who endeavor to turn
slave labor to account in the most Southern districts of the Union, have
emigrated from the North. The natives of the Northern States are constantly
spreading over that portion of the American territory where they have less to
fear from competition; they discover resources there which escaped the notice
of the inhabitants; and, as they comply with a system which they do not
approve, they succeed in turning it to better advantage than those who first
founded and who still maintain it.
Were I inclined to continue this parallel, I could easily prove that almost all
the differences which may be remarked between the characters of the Americans
in the Southern and in the Northern States have originated in slavery; but this
would divert me from my subject, and my present intention is not to point out
all the consequences of servitude, but those effects which it has produced upon
the prosperity of the countries which have admitted it.
The influence of slavery upon the production of wealth must have been very
imperfectly known in antiquity, as slavery then obtained throughout the
civilized world; and the nations which were unacquainted with it were
barbarous. And indeed Christianity only abolished slavery by advocating the
claims of the slave; at the present time it may be attacked in the name of the
master, and, upon this point, interest is reconciled with morality.
As these truths became apparent in the United States, slavery receded before
the progress of experience. Servitude had begun in the South, and had thence
spread towards the North; but it now retires again. Freedom, which started from
the North, now descends uninterruptedly towards the South. Amongst the great
States, Pennsylvania now constitutes the extreme limit of slavery to the North:
but even within those limits the slave system is shaken: Maryland, which is
immediately below Pennsylvania, is preparing for its abolition; and Virginia,
which comes next to Maryland, is already discussing its utility and its
dangers. *l
l 
[ A peculiar reason contributes to detach the two last-mentioned States from
the cause of slavery. The former wealth of this part of the Union was
principally derived from the cultivation of tobacco. This cultivation is
specially carried on by slaves; but within the last few years the market-price
of tobacco has diminished, whilst the value of the slaves remains the same.
Thus the ratio between the cost of production and the value of the produce is
changed. The natives of Maryland and Virginia are therefore more disposed than
they were thirty years ago, to give up slave labor in the cultivation of
tobacco, or to give up slavery and tobacco at the same time.]
No great change takes place in human institutions without involving amongst its
causes the law of inheritance. When the law of primogeniture obtained in the
South, each family was represented by a wealthy individual, who was neither
compelled nor induced to labor; and he was surrounded, as by parasitic plants,
by the other members of his family who were then excluded by law from sharing
the common inheritance, and who led the same kind of life as himself. The very
same thing then occurred in all the families of the South as still happens in
the wealthy families of some countries in Europe, namely, that the younger sons
remain in the same state of idleness as their elder brother, without being as
rich as he is. This identical result seems to be produced in Europe and in
America by wholly analogous causes. In the South of the United States the whole
race of whites formed an aristocratic body, which was headed by a certain
number of privileged individuals, whose wealth was permanent, and whose leisure
was hereditary. These leaders of the American nobility kept alive the
traditional prejudices of the white race in the body of which they were the
representatives, and maintained the honor of inactive life. This aristocracy
contained many who were poor, but none who would work; its members preferred
want to labor, consequently no competition was set on foot against negro
laborers and slaves, and, whatever opinion might be entertained as to the
utility of their efforts, it was indispensable to employ them, since there was
no one else to work.
No sooner was the law of primogeniture abolished than fortunes began to
diminish, and all the families of the country were simultaneously reduced to a
state in which labor became necessary to procure the means of subsistence:
several of them have since entirely disappeared, and all of them learned to
look forward to the time at which it would be necessary for everyone to provide
for his own wants. Wealthy individuals are still to be met with, but they no
longer constitute a compact and hereditary body, nor have they been able to
adopt a line of conduct in which they could persevere, and which they could
infuse into all ranks of society. The prejudice which stigmatized labor was in
the first place abandoned by common consent; the number of needy men was
increased, and the needy were allowed to gain a laborious subsistence without
blushing for their exertions. Thus one of the most immediate consequences of
the partible quality of estates has been to create a class of free laborers. As
soon as a competition was set on foot between the free laborer and the slave,
the inferiority of the latter became manifest, and slavery was attacked in its
fundamental principle, which is the interest of the master.
As slavery recedes, the black population follows its retrograde course, and
returns with it towards those tropical regions from which it originally came.
However singular this fact may at first appear to be, it may readily be
explained. Although the Americans abolish the principle of slavery, they do not
set their slaves free. To illustrate this remark, I will quote the example of
the State of New York. In 1788, the State of New York prohibited the sale of
slaves within its limits, which was an indirect method of prohibiting the
importation of blacks. Thenceforward the number of negroes could only increase
according to the ratio of the natural increase of population. But eight years
later a more decisive measure was taken, and it was enacted that all children
born of slave parents after July 4, 1799, should be free. No increase could
then take place, and although slaves still existed, slavery might be said to be
abolished.
From the time at which a Northern State prohibited the importation of slaves,
no slaves were brought from the South to be sold in its markets. On the other
hand, as the sale of slaves was forbidden in that State, an owner was no longer
able to get rid of his slave (who thus became a burdensome possession)
otherwise than by transporting him to the South. But when a Northern State
declared that the son of the slave should be born free, the slave lost a large
portion of his market value, since his posterity was no longer included in the
bargain, and the owner had then a strong interest in transporting him to the
South. Thus the same law prevents the slaves of the South from coming to the
Northern States, and drives those of the North to the South.
The want of free hands is felt in a State in proportion as the number of slaves
decreases. But in proportion as labor is performed by free hands, slave labor
becomes less productive; and the slave is then a useless or onerous possession,
whom it is important to export to those Southern States where the same
competition is not to be feared. Thus the abolition of slavery does not set the
slave free, but it merely transfers him from one master to another, and from
the North to the South.
The emancipated negroes, and those born after the abolition of slavery, do not,
indeed, migrate from the North to the South; but their situation with regard to
the Europeans is not unlike that of the aborigines of America; they remain half
civilized, and deprived of their rights in the midst of a population which is
far superior to them in wealth and in knowledge; where they are exposed to the
tyranny of the laws *m and the intolerance of the people. On some accounts they
are still more to be pitied than the Indians, since they are haunted by the
reminiscence of slavery, and they cannot claim possession of a single portion
of the soil: many of them perish miserably, *n and the rest congregate in the
great towns, where they perform the meanest offices, and lead a wretched and
precarious existence.
m 
[ The States in which slavery is abolished usually do what they can to render
their territory disagreeable to the negroes as a place of residence; and as a
kind of emulation exists between the different States in this respect, the
unhappy blacks can only choose the least of the evils which beset them.]
n 
[ There is a very great difference between the mortality of the blacks and of
the whites in the States in which slavery is abolished; from 1820 to 1831 only
one out of forty-two individuals of the white population died in Philadelphia;
but one negro out of twenty-one individuals of the black population died in the
same space of time. The mortality is by no means so great amongst the negroes
who are still slaves. (See Emerson’s “Medical Statistics,” p.
28.)]
But even if the number of negroes continued to increase as rapidly as when they
were still in a state of slavery, as the number of whites augments with twofold
rapidity since the abolition of slavery, the blacks would soon be, as it were,
lost in the midst of a strange population.
A district which is cultivated by slaves is in general more scantily peopled
than a district cultivated by free labor: moreover, America is still a new
country, and a State is therefore not half peopled at the time when it
abolishes slavery. No sooner is an end put to slavery than the want of free
labor is felt, and a crowd of enterprising adventurers immediately arrive from
all parts of the country, who hasten to profit by the fresh resources which are
then opened to industry. The soil is soon divided amongst them, and a family of
white settlers takes possession of each tract of country. Besides which,
European emigration is exclusively directed to the free States; for what would
be the fate of a poor emigrant who crosses the Atlantic in search of ease and
happiness if he were to land in a country where labor is stigmatized as
degrading?
Thus the white population grows by its natural increase, and at the same time
by the immense influx of emigrants; whilst the black population receives no
emigrants, and is upon its decline. The proportion which existed between the
two races is soon inverted. The negroes constitute a scanty remnant, a poor
tribe of vagrants, which is lost in the midst of an immense people in full
possession of the land; and the presence of the blacks is only marked by the
injustice and the hardships of which they are the unhappy victims.
In several of the Western States the negro race never made its appearance, and
in all the Northern States it is rapidly declining. Thus the great question of
its future condition is confined within a narrow circle, where it becomes less
formidable, though not more easy of solution.
The more we descend towards the South, the more difficult does it become to
abolish slavery with advantage: and this arises from several physical causes
which it is important to point out.
The first of these causes is the climate; it is well known that in proportion
as Europeans approach the tropics they suffer more from labor. Many of the
Americans even assert that within a certain latitude the exertions which a
negro can make without danger are fatal to them; *o but I do not think that
this opinion, which is so favorable to the indolence of the inhabitants of
southern regions, is confirmed by experience. The southern parts of the Union
are not hotter than the South of Italy and of Spain; *p and it may be asked why
the European cannot work as well there as in the two latter countries. If
slavery has been abolished in Italy and in Spain without causing the
destruction of the masters, why should not the same thing take place in the
Union? I cannot believe that nature has prohibited the Europeans in Georgia and
the Floridas, under pain of death, from raising the means of subsistence from
the soil, but their labor would unquestionably be more irksome and less
productive to them than to the inhabitants of New England. As the free workman
thus loses a portion of his superiority over the slave in the Southern States,
there are fewer inducements to abolish slavery.
o 
[ This is true of the spots in which rice is cultivated; rice-grounds, which
are unwholesome in all countries, are particularly dangerous in those regions
which are exposed to the beams of a tropical sun. Europeans would not find it
easy to cultivate the soil in that part of the New World if it must be
necessarily be made to produce rice; but may they not subsist without
rice-grounds?]
p 
[ These States are nearer to the equator than Italy and Spain, but the
temperature of the continent of America is very much lower than that of Europe.
The Spanish Government formerly caused a certain number of peasants from the
Acores to be transported into a district of Louisiana called Attakapas, by way
of experiment. These settlers still cultivate the soil without the assistance
of slaves, but their industry is so languid as scarcely to supply their most
necessary wants.]
All the plants of Europe grow in the northern parts of the Union; the South has
special productions of its own. It has been observed that slave labor is a very
expensive method of cultivating corn. The farmer of corn land in a country
where slavery is unknown habitually retains a small number of laborers in his
service, and at seed-time and harvest he hires several additional hands, who
only live at his cost for a short period. But the agriculturist in a slave
State is obliged to keep a large number of slaves the whole year round, in
order to sow his fields and to gather in his crops, although their services are
only required for a few weeks; but slaves are unable to wait till they are
hired, and to subsist by their own labor in the mean time like free laborers;
in order to have their services they must be bought. Slavery, independently of
its general disadvantages, is therefore still more inapplicable to countries in
which corn is cultivated than to those which produce crops of a different kind.
The cultivation of tobacco, of cotton, and especially of the sugar-cane,
demands, on the other hand, unremitting attention: and women and children are
employed in it, whose services are of but little use in the cultivation of
wheat. Thus slavery is naturally more fitted to the countries from which these
productions are derived. Tobacco, cotton, and the sugar-cane are exclusively
grown in the South, and they form one of the principal sources of the wealth of
those States. If slavery were abolished, the inhabitants of the South would be
constrained to adopt one of two alternatives: they must either change their
system of cultivation, and then they would come into competition with the more
active and more experienced inhabitants of the North; or, if they continued to
cultivate the same produce without slave labor, they would have to support the
competition of the other States of the South, which might still retain their
slaves. Thus, peculiar reasons for maintaining slavery exist in the South which
do not operate in the North.
But there is yet another motive which is more cogent than all the others: the
South might indeed, rigorously speaking, abolish slavery; but how should it rid
its territory of the black population? Slaves and slavery are driven from the
North by the same law, but this twofold result cannot be hoped for in the
South.
The arguments which I have adduced to show that slavery is more natural and
more advantageous in the South than in the North, sufficiently prove that the
number of slaves must be far greater in the former districts. It was to the
southern settlements that the first Africans were brought, and it is there that
the greatest number of them have always been imported. As we advance towards
the South, the prejudice which sanctions idleness increases in power. In the
States nearest to the tropics there is not a single white laborer; the negroes
are consequently much more numerous in the South than in the North. And, as I
have already observed, this disproportion increases daily, since the negroes
are transferred to one part of the Union as soon as slavery is abolished in the
other. Thus the black population augments in the South, not only by its natural
fecundity, but by the compulsory emigration of the negroes from the North; and
the African race has causes of increase in the South very analogous to those
which so powerfully accelerate the growth of the European race in the North.
In the State of Maine there is one negro in 300 inhabitants; in Massachusetts,
one in 100; in New York, two in 100; in Pennsylvania, three in the same number;
in Maryland, thirty-four; in Virginia, forty-two; and lastly, in South Carolina
*q fifty-five per cent. Such was the proportion of the black population to the
whites in the year 1830. But this proportion is perpetually changing, as it
constantly decreases in the North and augments in the South.
q 
[ We find it asserted in an American work, entitled “Letters on the
Colonization Society,” by Mr. Carey, 1833, “That for the last forty
years the black race has increased more rapidly than the white race in the
State of South Carolina; and that if we take the average population of the five
States of the South into which slaves were first introduced, viz., Maryland,
Virginia, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Georgia, we shall find that from
1790 to 1830 the whites have augmented in the proportion of 80 to 100, and the
blacks in that of 112 to 100.”
In the United States, in 1830, the population of the two races stood as
follows:—
States where slavery is abolished, 6,565,434 whites; 120,520 blacks. Slave
States, 3,960,814 whites; 2,208,102 blacks. [In 1890 the United States
contained a population of 54,983,890 whites, and 7,638,360 negroes.]]
It is evident that the most Southern States of the Union cannot abolish slavery
without incurring very great dangers, which the North had no reason to
apprehend when it emancipated its black population. We have already shown the
system by which the Northern States secure the transition from slavery to
freedom, by keeping the present generation in chains, and setting their
descendants free; by this means the negroes are gradually introduced into
society; and whilst the men who might abuse their freedom are kept in a state
of servitude, those who are emancipated may learn the art of being free before
they become their own masters. But it would be difficult to apply this method
in the South. To declare that all the negroes born after a certain period shall
be free, is to introduce the principle and the notion of liberty into the heart
of slavery; the blacks whom the law thus maintains in a state of slavery from
which their children are delivered, are astonished at so unequal a fate, and
their astonishment is only the prelude to their impatience and irritation.
Thenceforward slavery loses, in their eyes, that kind of moral power which it
derived from time and habit; it is reduced to a mere palpable abuse of force.
The Northern States had nothing to fear from the contrast, because in them the
blacks were few in number, and the white population was very considerable. But
if this faint dawn of freedom were to show two millions of men their true
position, the oppressors would have reason to tremble. After having
affranchised the children of their slaves the Europeans of the Southern States
would very shortly be obliged to extend the same benefit to the whole black
population.
In the North, as I have already remarked, a twofold migration ensues upon the
abolition of slavery, or even precedes that event when circumstances have
rendered it probable; the slaves quit the country to be transported southwards;
and the whites of the Northern States, as well as the emigrants from Europe,
hasten to fill up their place. But these two causes cannot operate in the same
manner in the Southern States. On the one hand, the mass of slaves is too great
for any expectation of their ever being removed from the country to be
entertained; and on the other hand, the Europeans and Anglo-Americans of the
North are afraid to come to inhabit a country in which labor has not yet been
reinstated in its rightful honors. Besides, they very justly look upon the
States in which the proportion of the negroes equals or exceeds that of the
whites, as exposed to very great dangers; and they refrain from turning their
activity in that direction.
Thus the inhabitants of the South would not be able, like their Northern
countrymen, to initiate the slaves gradually into a state of freedom by
abolishing slavery; they have no means of perceptibly diminishing the black
population, and they would remain unsupported to repress its excesses. So that
in the course of a few years, a great people of free negroes would exist in the
heart of a white nation of equal size.
The same abuses of power which still maintain slavery, would then become the
source of the most alarming perils which the white population of the South
might have to apprehend. At the present time the descendants of the Europeans
are the sole owners of the land; the absolute masters of all labor; and the
only persons who are possessed of wealth, knowledge, and arms. The black is
destitute of all these advantages, but he subsists without them because he is a
slave. If he were free, and obliged to provide for his own subsistence, would
it be possible for him to remain without these things and to support life? Or
would not the very instruments of the present superiority of the white, whilst
slavery exists, expose him to a thousand dangers if it were abolished?
As long as the negro remains a slave, he may be kept in a condition not very
far removed from that of the brutes; but, with his liberty, he cannot but
acquire a degree of instruction which will enable him to appreciate his
misfortunes, and to discern a remedy for them. Moreover, there exists a
singular principle of relative justice which is very firmly implanted in the
human heart. Men are much more forcibly struck by those inequalities which
exist within the circle of the same class, than with those which may be
remarked between different classes. It is more easy for them to admit slavery,
than to allow several millions of citizens to exist under a load of eternal
infamy and hereditary wretchedness. In the North the population of freed
negroes feels these hardships and resents these indignities; but its numbers
and its powers are small, whilst in the South it would be numerous and strong.
As soon as it is admitted that the whites and the emancipated blacks are placed
upon the same territory in the situation of two alien communities, it will
readily be understood that there are but two alternatives for the future; the
negroes and the whites must either wholly part or wholly mingle. I have already
expressed the conviction which I entertain as to the latter event. *r I do not
imagine that the white and black races will ever live in any country upon an
equal footing. But I believe the difficulty to be still greater in the United
States than elsewhere. An isolated individual may surmount the prejudices of
religion, of his country, or of his race, and if this individual is a king he
may effect surprising changes in society; but a whole people cannot rise, as it
were, above itself. A despot who should subject the Americans and their former
slaves to the same yoke, might perhaps succeed in commingling their races; but
as long as the American democracy remains at the head of affairs, no one will
undertake so difficult a task; and it may be foreseen that the freer the white
population of the United States becomes, the more isolated will it remain. *s
r 
[ This opinion is sanctioned by authorities infinitely weightier than anything
that I can say: thus, for instance, it is stated in the “Memoirs of
Jefferson” (as collected by M. Conseil), “Nothing is more clearly
written in the book of destiny than the emancipation of the blacks; and it is
equally certain that the two races will never live in a state of equal freedom
under the same government, so insurmountable are the barriers which nature,
habit, and opinions have established between them.”]
s 
[ If the British West India planters had governed themselves, they would
assuredly not have passed the Slave Emancipation Bill which the mother-country
has recently imposed upon them.]
I have previously observed that the mixed race is the true bond of union
between the Europeans and the Indians; just so the mulattoes are the true means
of transition between the white and the negro; so that wherever mulattoes
abound, the intermixture of the two races is not impossible. In some parts of
America, the European and the negro races are so crossed by one another, that
it is rare to meet with a man who is entirely black, or entirely white: when
they are arrived at this point, the two races may really be said to be
combined; or rather to have been absorbed in a third race, which is connected
with both without being identical with either.
Of all the Europeans the English are those who have mixed least with the
negroes. More mulattoes are to be seen in the South of the Union than in the
North, but still they are infinitely more scarce than in any other European
colony: mulattoes are by no means numerous in the United States; they have no
force peculiar to themselves, and when quarrels originating in differences of
color take place, they generally side with the whites; just as the lackeys of
the great, in Europe, assume the contemptuous airs of nobility to the lower
orders.
The pride of origin, which is natural to the English, is singularly augmented
by the personal pride which democratic liberty fosters amongst the Americans:
the white citizen of the United States is proud of his race, and proud of
himself. But if the whites and the negroes do not intermingle in the North of
the Union, how should they mix in the South? Can it be supposed for an instant,
that an American of the Southern States, placed, as he must forever be, between
the white man with all his physical and moral superiority and the negro, will
ever think of preferring the latter? The Americans of the Southern States have
two powerful passions which will always keep them aloof; the first is the fear
of being assimilated to the negroes, their former slaves; and the second the
dread of sinking below the whites, their neighbors.
If I were called upon to predict what will probably occur at some future time,
I should say, that the abolition of slavery in the South will, in the common
course of things, increase the repugnance of the white population for the men
of color. I found this opinion upon the analogous observation which I already
had occasion to make in the North. I there remarked that the white inhabitants
of the North avoid the negroes with increasing care, in proportion as the legal
barriers of separation are removed by the legislature; and why should not the
same result take place in the South? In the North, the whites are deterred from
intermingling with the blacks by the fear of an imaginary danger; in the South,
where the danger would be real, I cannot imagine that the fear would be less
general.
If, on the one hand, it be admitted (and the fact is unquestionable) that the
colored population perpetually accumulates in the extreme South, and that it
increases more rapidly than that of the whites; and if, on the other hand, it
be allowed that it is impossible to foresee a time at which the whites and the
blacks will be so intermingled as to derive the same benefits from society;
must it not be inferred that the blacks and the whites will, sooner or later,
come to open strife in the Southern States of the Union? But if it be asked
what the issue of the struggle is likely to be, it will readily be understood
that we are here left to form a very vague surmise of the truth. The human mind
may succeed in tracing a wide circle, as it were, which includes the course of
future events; but within that circle a thousand various chances and
circumstances may direct it in as many different ways; and in every picture of
the future there is a dim spot, which the eye of the understanding cannot
penetrate. It appears, however, to be extremely probable that in the West
Indian Islands the white race is destined to be subdued, and the black
population to share the same fate upon the continent.
In the West India Islands the white planters are surrounded by an immense black
population; on the continent, the blacks are placed between the ocean and an
innumerable people, which already extends over them in a dense mass, from the
icy confines of Canada to the frontiers of Virginia, and from the banks of the
Missouri to the shores of the Atlantic. If the white citizens of North America
remain united, it cannot be supposed that the negroes will escape the
destruction with which they are menaced; they must be subdued by want or by the
sword. But the black population which is accumulated along the coast of the
Gulf of Mexico, has a chance of success if the American Union is dissolved when
the struggle between the two races begins. If the federal tie were broken, the
citizens of the South would be wrong to rely upon any lasting succor from their
Northern countrymen. The latter are well aware that the danger can never reach
them; and unless they are constrained to march to the assistance of the South
by a positive obligation, it may be foreseen that the sympathy of color will be
insufficient to stimulate their exertions.
Yet, at whatever period the strife may break out, the whites of the South, even
if they are abandoned to their own resources, will enter the lists with an
immense superiority of knowledge and of the means of warfare; but the blacks
will have numerical strength and the energy of despair upon their side, and
these are powerful resources to men who have taken up arms. The fate of the
white population of the Southern States will, perhaps, be similar to that of
the Moors in Spain. After having occupied the land for centuries, it will
perhaps be forced to retire to the country whence its ancestors came, and to
abandon to the negroes the possession of a territory, which Providence seems to
have more peculiarly destined for them, since they can subsist and labor in it
more easily that the whites.
The danger of a conflict between the white and the black inhabitants of the
Southern States of the Union—a danger which, however remote it may be, is
inevitable—perpetually haunts the imagination of the Americans. The
inhabitants of the North make it a common topic of conversation, although they
have no direct injury to fear from the struggle; but they vainly endeavor to
devise some means of obviating the misfortunes which they foresee. In the
Southern States the subject is not discussed: the planter does not allude to
the future in conversing with strangers; the citizen does not communicate his
apprehensions to his friends; he seeks to conceal them from himself; but there
is something more alarming in the tacit forebodings of the South, than in the
clamorous fears of the Northern States.
This all-pervading disquietude has given birth to an undertaking which is but
little known, but which may have the effect of changing the fate of a portion
of the human race. From apprehension of the dangers which I have just been
describing, a certain number of American citizens have formed a society for the
purpose of exporting to the coast of Guinea, at their own expense, such free
negroes as may be willing to escape from the oppression to which they are
subject. *t In 1820, the society to which I allude formed a settlement in
Africa, upon the seventh degree of north latitude, which bears the name of
Liberia. The most recent intelligence informs us that 2,500 negroes are
collected there; they have introduced the democratic institutions of America
into the country of their forefathers; and Liberia has a representative system
of government, negro jurymen, negro magistrates, and negro priests; churches
have been built, newspapers established, and, by a singular change in the
vicissitudes of the world, white men are prohibited from sojourning within the
settlement. *u
t 
[ This society assumed the name of “The Society for the Colonization of
the Blacks.” See its annual reports; and more particularly the fifteenth.
See also the pamphlet, to which allusion has already been made, entitled
“Letters on the Colonization Society, and on its probable Results,”
by Mr. Carey, Philadelphia, 1833.]
u 
[ This last regulation was laid down by the founders of the settlement; they
apprehended that a state of things might arise in Africa similar to that which
exists on the frontiers of the United States, and that if the negroes, like the
Indians, were brought into collision with a people more enlightened than
themselves, they would be destroyed before they could be civilized.]
This is indeed a strange caprice of fortune. Two hundred years have now elapsed
since the inhabitants of Europe undertook to tear the negro from his family and
his home, in order to transport him to the shores of North America; at the
present day, the European settlers are engaged in sending back the descendants
of those very negroes to the Continent from which they were originally taken;
and the barbarous Africans have been brought into contact with civilization in
the midst of bondage, and have become acquainted with free political
institutions in slavery. Up to the present time Africa has been closed against
the arts and sciences of the whites; but the inventions of Europe will perhaps
penetrate into those regions, now that they are introduced by Africans
themselves. The settlement of Liberia is founded upon a lofty and a most
fruitful idea; but whatever may be its results with regard to the Continent of
Africa, it can afford no remedy to the New World.
In twelve years the Colonization Society has transported 2,500 negroes to
Africa; in the same space of time about 700,000 blacks were born in the United
States. If the colony of Liberia were so situated as to be able to receive
thousands of new inhabitants every year, and if the negroes were in a state to
be sent thither with advantage; if the Union were to supply the society with
annual subsidies, *v and to transport the negroes to Africa in the vessels of
the State, it would still be unable to counterpoise the natural increase of
population amongst the blacks; and as it could not remove as many men in a year
as are born upon its territory within the same space of time, it would fail in
suspending the growth of the evil which is daily increasing in the States. *w
The negro race will never leave those shores of the American continent, to
which it was brought by the passions and the vices of Europeans; and it will
not disappear from the New World as long as it continues to exist. The
inhabitants of the United States may retard the calamities which they
apprehend, but they cannot now destroy their efficient cause.
v 
[ Nor would these be the only difficulties attendant upon the undertaking; if
the Union undertook to buy up the negroes now in America, in order to transport
them to Africa, the price of slaves, increasing with their scarcity, would soon
become enormous; and the States of the North would never consent to expend such
great sums for a purpose which would procure such small advantages to
themselves. If the Union took possession of the slaves in the Southern States
by force, or at a rate determined by law, an insurmountable resistance would
arise in that part of the country. Both alternatives are equally impossible.]
w 
[ In 1830 there were in the United States 2,010,327 slaves and 319,439 free
blacks, in all 2,329,766 negroes: which formed about one-fifth of the total
population of the United States at that time.]
I am obliged to confess that I do not regard the abolition of slavery as a
means of warding off the struggle of the two races in the United States. The
negroes may long remain slaves without complaining; but if they are once raised
to the level of free men, they will soon revolt at being deprived of all their
civil rights; and as they cannot become the equals of the whites, they will
speedily declare themselves as enemies. In the North everything contributed to
facilitate the emancipation of the slaves; and slavery was abolished, without
placing the free negroes in a position which could become formidable, since
their number was too small for them ever to claim the exercise of their rights.
But such is not the case in the South. The question of slavery was a question
of commerce and manufacture for the slave-owners in the North; for those of the
South, it is a question of life and death. God forbid that I should seek to
justify the principle of negro slavery, as has been done by some American
writers! But I only observe that all the countries which formerly adopted that
execrable principle are not equally able to abandon it at the present time.
When I contemplate the condition of the South, I can only discover two
alternatives which may be adopted by the white inhabitants of those States;
viz., either to emancipate the negroes, and to intermingle with them; or,
remaining isolated from them, to keep them in a state of slavery as long as
possible. All intermediate measures seem to me likely to terminate, and that
shortly, in the most horrible of civil wars, and perhaps in the extirpation of
one or other of the two races. Such is the view which the Americans of the
South take of the question, and they act consistently with it. As they are
determined not to mingle with the negroes, they refuse to emancipate them.
Not that the inhabitants of the South regard slavery as necessary to the wealth
of the planter, for on this point many of them agree with their Northern
countrymen in freely admitting that slavery is prejudicial to their interest;
but they are convinced that, however prejudicial it may be, they hold their
lives upon no other tenure. The instruction which is now diffused in the South
has convinced the inhabitants that slavery is injurious to the slave-owner, but
it has also shown them, more clearly than before, that no means exist of
getting rid of its bad consequences. Hence arises a singular contrast; the more
the utility of slavery is contested, the more firmly is it established in the
laws; and whilst the principle of servitude is gradually abolished in the
North, that self-same principle gives rise to more and more rigorous
consequences in the South.
The legislation of the Southern States with regard to slaves, presents at the
present day such unparalleled atrocities as suffice to show how radically the
laws of humanity have been perverted, and to betray the desperate position of
the community in which that legislation has been promulgated. The Americans of
this portion of the Union have not, indeed, augmented the hardships of slavery;
they have, on the contrary, bettered the physical condition of the slaves. The
only means by which the ancients maintained slavery were fetters and death; the
Americans of the South of the Union have discovered more intellectual
securities for the duration of their power. They have employed their despotism
and their violence against the human mind. In antiquity, precautions were taken
to prevent the slave from breaking his chains; at the present day measures are
adopted to deprive him even of the desire of freedom. The ancients kept the
bodies of their slaves in bondage, but they placed no restraint upon the mind
and no check upon education; and they acted consistently with their established
principle, since a natural termination of slavery then existed, and one day or
other the slave might be set free, and become the equal of his master. But the
Americans of the South, who do not admit that the negroes can ever be
commingled with themselves, have forbidden them to be taught to read or to
write, under severe penalties; and as they will not raise them to their own
level, they sink them as nearly as possible to that of the brutes.
The hope of liberty had always been allowed to the slave to cheer the hardships
of his condition. But the Americans of the South are well aware that
emancipation cannot but be dangerous, when the freed man can never be
assimilated to his former master. To give a man his freedom, and to leave him
in wretchedness and ignominy, is nothing less than to prepare a future chief
for a revolt of the slaves. Moreover, it has long been remarked that the
presence of a free negro vaguely agitates the minds of his less fortunate
brethren, and conveys to them a dim notion of their rights. The Americans of
the South have consequently taken measures to prevent slave-owners from
emancipating their slaves in most cases; not indeed by a positive prohibition,
but by subjecting that step to various forms which it is difficult to comply
with. I happened to meet with an old man, in the South of the Union, who had
lived in illicit intercourse with one of his negresses, and had had several
children by her, who were born the slaves of their father. He had indeed
frequently thought of bequeathing to them at least their liberty; but years had
elapsed without his being able to surmount the legal obstacles to their
emancipation, and in the mean while his old age was come, and he was about to
die. He pictured to himself his sons dragged from market to market, and passing
from the authority of a parent to the rod of the stranger, until these horrid
anticipations worked his expiring imagination into frenzy. When I saw him he
was a prey to all the anguish of despair, and he made me feel how awful is the
retribution of nature upon those who have broken her laws.
These evils are unquestionably great; but they are the necessary and foreseen
consequence of the very principle of modern slavery. When the Europeans chose
their slaves from a race differing from their own, which many of them
considered as inferior to the other races of mankind, and which they all
repelled with horror from any notion of intimate connection, they must have
believed that slavery would last forever; since there is no intermediate state
which can be durable between the excessive inequality produced by servitude and
the complete equality which originates in independence. The Europeans did
imperfectly feel this truth, but without acknowledging it even to themselves.
Whenever they have had to do with negroes, their conduct has either been
dictated by their interest and their pride, or by their compassion. They first
violated every right of humanity by their treatment of the negro and they
afterwards informed him that those rights were precious and inviolable. They
affected to open their ranks to the slaves, but the negroes who attempted to
penetrate into the community were driven back with scorn; and they have
incautiously and involuntarily been led to admit of freedom instead of slavery,
without having the courage to be wholly iniquitous, or wholly just.
If it be impossible to anticipate a period at which the Americans of the South
will mingle their blood with that of the negroes, can they allow their slaves
to become free without compromising their own security? And if they are obliged
to keep that race in bondage in order to save their own families, may they not
be excused for availing themselves of the means best adapted to that end? The
events which are taking place in the Southern States of the Union appear to me
to be at once the most horrible and the most natural results of slavery. When I
see the order of nature overthrown, and when I hear the cry of humanity in its
vain struggle against the laws, my indignation does not light upon the men of
our own time who are the instruments of these outrages; but I reserve my
execration for those who, after a thousand years of freedom, brought back
slavery into the world once more.
Whatever may be the efforts of the Americans of the South to maintain slavery,
they will not always succeed. Slavery, which is now confined to a single tract
of the civilized earth, which is attacked by Christianity as unjust, and by
political economy as prejudicial; and which is now contrasted with democratic
liberties and the information of our age, cannot survive. By the choice of the
master, or by the will of the slave, it will cease; and in either case great
calamities may be expected to ensue. If liberty be refused to the negroes of
the South, they will in the end seize it for themselves by force; if it be
given, they will abuse it ere long. *x

[ [This chapter is no longer applicable to the condition of the negro race in
the United States, since the abolition of slavery was the result, though not
the object, of the great Civil War, and the negroes have been raised to the
condition not only of freedmen, but of citizens; and in some States they
exercise a preponderating political power by reason of their numerical
majority. Thus, in South Carolina there were in 1870, 289,667 whites and
415,814 blacks. But the emancipation of the slaves has not solved the problem,
how two races so different and so hostile are to live together in peace in one
country on equal terms. That problem is as difficult, perhaps more difficult
than ever; and to this difficulty the author’s remarks are still
perfectly applicable.]]
What Are The Chances In Favor Of The Duration Of The American Union, And What
Dangers Threaten It *y
y 
[ [This chapter is one of the most curious and interesting portions of the
work, because it embraces almost all the constitutional and social questions
which were raised by the great secession of the South and decided by the
results of the Civil War. But it must be confessed that the sagacity of the
author is sometimes at fault in these speculations, and did not save him from
considerable errors, which the course of events has since made apparent. He
held that “the legislators of the Constitution of 1789 were not appointed
to constitute the government of a single people, but to regulate the
association of several States; that the Union was formed by the voluntary
agreement of the States, and in uniting together they have not forfeited their
nationality, nor have they been reduced to the condition of one and the same
people.” Whence he inferred that “if one of the States chose to
withdraw its name from the contract, it would be difficult to disprove its
right of doing so; and that the Federal Government would have no means of
maintaining its claims directly, either by force or by right.” This is
the Southern theory of the Constitution, and the whole case of the South in
favor of secession. To many Europeans, and to some American (Northern) jurists,
this view appeared to be sound; but it was vigorously resisted by the North,
and crushed by force of arms.
The author of this book was mistaken in supposing that the “Union was a
vast body which presents no definite object to patriotic feeling.” When
the day of trial came, millions of men were ready to lay down their lives for
it. He was also mistaken in supposing that the Federal Executive is so weak
that it requires the free consent of the governed to enable it to subsist, and
that it would be defeated in a struggle to maintain the Union against one or
more separate States. In 1861 nine States, with a population of 8,753,000,
seceded, and maintained for four years a resolute but unequal contest for
independence, but they were defeated.
Lastly, the author was mistaken in supposing that a community of interests
would always prevail between North and South sufficiently powerful to bind them
together. He overlooked the influence which the question of slavery must have
on the Union the moment that the majority of the people of the North declared
against it. In 1831, when the author visited America, the anti-slavery
agitation had scarcely begun; and the fact of Southern slavery was accepted by
men of all parties, even in the States where there were no slaves: and that was
unquestionably the view taken by all the States and by all American statesmen
at the time of the adoption of the Constitution, in 1789. But in the course of
thirty years a great change took place, and the North refused to perpetuate
what had become the “peculiar institution” of the South, especially
as it gave the South a species of aristocratic preponderance. The result was
the ratification, in December, 1865, of the celebrated 13th article or
amendment of the Constitution, which declared that “neither slavery nor
involuntary servitude—except as a punishment for crime—shall exist
within the United States.” To which was soon afterwards added the 15th
article, “The right of citizens to vote shall not be denied or abridged
by the United States, or by any State, on account of race, color, or previous
servitude.” The emancipation of several millions of negro slaves without
compensation, and the transfer to them of political preponderance in the States
in which they outnumber the white population, were acts of the North totally
opposed to the interests of the South, and which could only have been carried
into effect by conquest.—Translator’s Note.]]
Reason for which the preponderating force lies in the States rather than in the
Union—The Union will only last as long as all the States choose to belong
to it—Causes which tend to keep them united—Utility of the Union to
resist foreign enemies, and to prevent the existence of foreigners in
America—No natural barriers between the several States—No
conflicting interests to divide them—Reciprocal interests of the
Northern, Southern, and Western States—Intellectual ties of
union—Uniformity of opinions—Dangers of the Union resulting from
the different characters and the passions of its citizens—Character of
the citizens in the South and in the North—The rapid growth of the Union
one of its greatest dangers—Progress of the population to the
Northwest—Power gravitates in the same direction—Passions
originating from sudden turns of fortune—Whether the existing Government
of the Union tends to gain strength, or to lose it—Various signs of its
decrease—Internal improvements—Waste lands—Indians—The
Bank—The Tariff—General Jackson.
The maintenance of the existing institutions of the several States depends in
some measure upon the maintenance of the Union itself. It is therefore
important in the first instance to inquire into the probable fate of the Union.
One point may indeed be assumed at once: if the present confederation were
dissolved, it appears to me to be incontestable that the States of which it is
now composed would not return to their original isolated condition, but that
several unions would then be formed in the place of one. It is not my intention
to inquire into the principles upon which these new unions would probably be
established, but merely to show what the causes are which may effect the
dismemberment of the existing confederation.
With this object I shall be obliged to retrace some of the steps which I have
already taken, and to revert to topics which I have before discussed. I am
aware that the reader may accuse me of repetition, but the importance of the
matter which still remains to be treated is my excuse; I had rather say too
much, than say too little to be thoroughly understood, and I prefer injuring
the author to slighting the subject.
The legislators who formed the Constitution of 1789 endeavored to confer a
distinct and preponderating authority upon the federal power. But they were
confined by the conditions of the task which they had undertaken to perform.
They were not appointed to constitute the government of a single people, but to
regulate the association of several States; and, whatever their inclinations
might be, they could not but divide the exercise of sovereignty in the end.
In order to understand the consequences of this division, it is necessary to
make a short distinction between the affairs of the Government. There are some
objects which are national by their very nature, that is to say, which affect
the nation as a body, and can only be intrusted to the man or the assembly of
men who most completely represent the entire nation. Amongst these may be
reckoned war and diplomacy. There are other objects which are provincial by
their very nature, that is to say, which only affect certain localities, and
which can only be properly treated in that locality. Such, for instance, is the
budget of a municipality. Lastly, there are certain objects of a mixed nature,
which are national inasmuch as they affect all the citizens who compose the
nation, and which are provincial inasmuch as it is not necessary that the
nation itself should provide for them all. Such are the rights which regulate
the civil and political condition of the citizens. No society can exist without
civil and political rights. These rights therefore interest all the citizens
alike; but it is not always necessary to the existence and the prosperity of
the nation that these rights should be uniform, nor, consequently, that they
should be regulated by the central authority.
There are, then, two distinct categories of objects which are submitted to the
direction of the sovereign power; and these categories occur in all
well-constituted communities, whatever the basis of the political constitution
may otherwise be. Between these two extremes the objects which I have termed
mixed may be considered to lie. As these objects are neither exclusively
national nor entirely provincial, they may be obtained by a national or by a
provincial government, according to the agreement of the contracting parties,
without in any way impairing the contract of association.
The sovereign power is usually formed by the union of separate individuals, who
compose a people; and individual powers or collective forces, each representing
a very small portion of the sovereign authority, are the sole elements which
are subjected to the general Government of their choice. In this case the
general Government is more naturally called upon to regulate, not only those
affairs which are of essential national importance, but those which are of a
more local interest; and the local governments are reduced to that small share
of sovereign authority which is indispensable to their prosperity.
But sometimes the sovereign authority is composed of preorganized political
bodies, by virtue of circumstances anterior to their union; and in this case
the provincial governments assume the control, not only of those affairs which
more peculiarly belong to their province, but of all, or of a part of the mixed
affairs to which allusion has been made. For the confederate nations which were
independent sovereign States before their union, and which still represent a
very considerable share of the sovereign power, have only consented to cede to
the general Government the exercise of those rights which are indispensable to
the Union.
When the national Government, independently of the prerogatives inherent in its
nature, is invested with the right of regulating the affairs which relate
partly to the general and partly to the local interests, it possesses a
preponderating influence. Not only are its own rights extensive, but all the
rights which it does not possess exist by its sufferance, and it may be
apprehended that the provincial governments may be deprived of their natural
and necessary prerogatives by its influence.
When, on the other hand, the provincial governments are invested with the power
of regulating those same affairs of mixed interest, an opposite tendency
prevails in society. The preponderating force resides in the province, not in
the nation; and it may be apprehended that the national Government may in the
end be stripped of the privileges which are necessary to its existence.
Independent nations have therefore a natural tendency to centralization, and
confederations to dismemberment.
It now only remains for us to apply these general principles to the American
Union. The several States were necessarily possessed of the right of regulating
all exclusively provincial affairs. Moreover these same States retained the
rights of determining the civil and political competency of the citizens, or
regulating the reciprocal relations of the members of the community, and of
dispensing justice; rights which are of a general nature, but which do not
necessarily appertain to the national Government. We have shown that the
Government of the Union is invested with the power of acting in the name of the
whole nation in those cases in which the nation has to appear as a single and
undivided power; as, for instance, in foreign relations, and in offering a
common resistance to a common enemy; in short, in conducting those affairs
which I have styled exclusively national.
In this division of the rights of sovereignty, the share of the Union seems at
first sight to be more considerable than that of the States; but a more
attentive investigation shows it to be less so. The undertakings of the
Government of the Union are more vast, but their influence is more rarely felt.
Those of the provincial governments are comparatively small, but they are
incessant, and they serve to keep alive the authority which they represent. The
Government of the Union watches the general interests of the country; but the
general interests of a people have a very questionable influence upon
individual happiness, whilst provincial interests produce a most immediate
effect upon the welfare of the inhabitants. The Union secures the independence
and the greatness of the nation, which do not immediately affect private
citizens; but the several States maintain the liberty, regulate the rights,
protect the fortune, and secure the life and the whole future prosperity of
every citizen.
The Federal Government is very far removed from its subjects, whilst the
provincial governments are within the reach of them all, and are ready to
attend to the smallest appeal. The central Government has upon its side the
passions of a few superior men who aspire to conduct it; but upon the side of
the provincial governments are the interests of all those second-rate
individuals who can only hope to obtain power within their own State, and who
nevertheless exercise the largest share of authority over the people because
they are placed nearest to its level. The Americans have therefore much more to
hope and to fear from the States than from the Union; and, in conformity with
the natural tendency of the human mind, they are more likely to attach
themselves to the former than to the latter. In this respect their habits and
feelings harmonize with their interests.
When a compact nation divides its sovereignty, and adopts a confederate form of
government, the traditions, the customs, and the manners of the people are for
a long time at variance with their legislation; and the former tend to give a
degree of influence to the central government which the latter forbids. When a
number of confederate states unite to form a single nation, the same causes
operate in an opposite direction. I have no doubt that if France were to become
a confederate republic like that of the United States, the government would at
first display more energy than that of the Union; and if the Union were to
alter its constitution to a monarchy like that of France, I think that the
American Government would be a long time in acquiring the force which now rules
the latter nation. When the national existence of the Anglo-Americans began,
their provincial existence was already of long standing; necessary relations
were established between the townships and the individual citizens of the same
States; and they were accustomed to consider some objects as common to them
all, and to conduct other affairs as exclusively relating to their own special
interests.
The Union is a vast body which presents no definite object to patriotic
feeling. The forms and limits of the State are distinct and circumscribed;
since it represents a certain number of objects which are familiar to the
citizens and beloved by all. It is identified with the very soil, with the
right of property and the domestic affections, with the recollections of the
past, the labors of the present, and the hopes of the future. Patriotism, then,
which is frequently a mere extension of individual egotism, is still directed
to the State, and is not excited by the Union. Thus the tendency of the
interests, the habits, and the feelings of the people is to centre political
activity in the States, in preference to the Union.
It is easy to estimate the different forces of the two governments, by
remarking the manner in which they fulfil their respective functions. Whenever
the government of a State has occasion to address an individual or an assembly
of individuals, its language is clear and imperative; and such is also the tone
of the Federal Government in its intercourse with individuals, but no sooner
has it anything to do with a State than it begins to parley, to explain its
motives and to justify its conduct, to argue, to advise, and, in short,
anything but to command. If doubts are raised as to the limits of the
constitutional powers of each government, the provincial government prefers its
claim with boldness, and takes prompt and energetic steps to support it. In the
mean while the Government of the Union reasons; it appeals to the interests, to
the good sense, to the glory of the nation; it temporizes, it negotiates, and
does not consent to act until it is reduced to the last extremity. At first
sight it might readily be imagined that it is the provincial government which
is armed with the authority of the nation, and that Congress represents a
single State.
The Federal Government is, therefore, notwithstanding the precautions of those
who founded it, naturally so weak that it more peculiarly requires the free
consent of the governed to enable it to subsist. It is easy to perceive that
its object is to enable the States to realize with facility their determination
of remaining united; and, as long as this preliminary condition exists, its
authority is great, temperate, and effective. The Constitution fits the
Government to control individuals, and easily to surmount such obstacles as
they may be inclined to offer; but it was by no means established with a view
to the possible separation of one or more of the States from the Union.
If the sovereignty of the Union were to engage in a struggle with that of the
States at the present day, its defeat may be confidently predicted; and it is
not probable that such a struggle would be seriously undertaken. As often as a
steady resistance is offered to the Federal Government it will be found to
yield. Experience has hitherto shown that whenever a State has demanded
anything with perseverance and resolution, it has invariably succeeded; and
that if a separate government has distinctly refused to act, it was left to do
as it thought fit. *z

[ See the conduct of the Northern States in the war of 1812. “During that
war,” says Jefferson in a letter to General Lafayette, “four of the
Eastern States were only attached to the Union, like so many inanimate bodies
to living men.”]
But even if the Government of the Union had any strength inherent in itself,
the physical situation of the country would render the exercise of that
strength very difficult. *a The United States cover an immense territory; they
are separated from each other by great distances; and the population is
disseminated over the surface of a country which is still half a wilderness. If
the Union were to undertake to enforce the allegiance of the confederate States
by military means, it would be in a position very analogous to that of England
at the time of the War of Independence.

[ The profound peace of the Union affords no pretext for a standing army; and
without a standing army a government is not prepared to profit by a favorable
opportunity to conquer resistance, and take the sovereign power by surprise.
[This note, and the paragraph in the text which precedes, have been shown by
the results of the Civil War to be a misconception of the writer.]]
However strong a government may be, it cannot easily escape from the
consequences of a principle which it has once admitted as the foundation of its
constitution. The Union was formed by the voluntary agreement of the States;
and, in uniting together, they have not forfeited their nationality, nor have
they been reduced to the condition of one and the same people. If one of the
States chose to withdraw its name from the contract, it would be difficult to
disprove its right of doing so; and the Federal Government would have no means
of maintaining its claims directly, either by force or by right. In order to
enable the Federal Government easily to conquer the resistance which may be
offered to it by any one of its subjects, it would be necessary that one or
more of them should be specially interested in the existence of the Union, as
has frequently been the case in the history of confederations.
If it be supposed that amongst the States which are united by the federal tie
there are some which exclusively enjoy the principal advantages of union, or
whose prosperity depends on the duration of that union, it is unquestionable
that they will always be ready to support the central Government in enforcing
the obedience of the others. But the Government would then be exerting a force
not derived from itself, but from a principle contrary to its nature. States
form confederations in order to derive equal advantages from their union; and
in the case just alluded to, the Federal Government would derive its power from
the unequal distribution of those benefits amongst the States.
If one of the confederate States have acquired a preponderance sufficiently
great to enable it to take exclusive possession of the central authority, it
will consider the other States as subject provinces, and it will cause its own
supremacy to be respected under the borrowed name of the sovereignty of the
Union. Great things may then be done in the name of the Federal Government, but
in reality that Government will have ceased to exist. *b In both these cases,
the power which acts in the name of the confederation becomes stronger the more
it abandons the natural state and the acknowledged principles of
confederations.
b 
[ Thus the province of Holland in the republic of the Low Countries, and the
Emperor in the Germanic Confederation, have sometimes put themselves in the
place of the union, and have employed the federal authority to their own
advantage.]
In America the existing Union is advantageous to all the States, but it is not
indispensable to any one of them. Several of them might break the federal tie
without compromising the welfare of the others, although their own prosperity
would be lessened. As the existence and the happiness of none of the States are
wholly dependent on the present Constitution, they would none of them be
disposed to make great personal sacrifices to maintain it. On the other hand,
there is no State which seems hitherto to have its ambition much interested in
the maintenance of the existing Union. They certainly do not all exercise the
same influence in the federal councils, but no one of them can hope to domineer
over the rest, or to treat them as its inferiors or as its subjects.
It appears to me unquestionable that if any portion of the Union seriously
desired to separate itself from the other States, they would not be able, nor
indeed would they attempt, to prevent it; and that the present Union will only
last as long as the States which compose it choose to continue members of the
confederation. If this point be admitted, the question becomes less difficult;
and our object is, not to inquire whether the States of the existing Union are
capable of separating, but whether they will choose to remain united.
Amongst the various reasons which tend to render the existing Union useful to
the Americans, two principal causes are peculiarly evident to the observer.
Although the Americans are, as it were, alone upon their continent, their
commerce makes them the neighbors of all the nations with which they trade.
Notwithstanding their apparent isolation, the Americans require a certain
degree of strength, which they cannot retain otherwise than by remaining united
to each other. If the States were to split, they would not only diminish the
strength which they are now able to display towards foreign nations, but they
would soon create foreign powers upon their own territory. A system of inland
custom-houses would then be established; the valleys would be divided by
imaginary boundary lines; the courses of the rivers would be confined by
territorial distinctions; and a multitude of hindrances would prevent the
Americans from exploring the whole of that vast continent which Providence has
allotted to them for a dominion. At present they have no invasion to fear, and
consequently no standing armies to maintain, no taxes to levy. If the Union
were dissolved, all these burdensome measures might ere long be required. The
Americans are then very powerfully interested in the maintenance of their
Union. On the other hand, it is almost impossible to discover any sort of
material interest which might at present tempt a portion of the Union to
separate from the other States.
When we cast our eyes upon the map of the United States, we perceive the chain
of the Alleghany Mountains, running from the northeast to the southwest, and
crossing nearly one thousand miles of country; and we are led to imagine that
the design of Providence was to raise between the valley of the Mississippi and
the coast of the Atlantic Ocean one of those natural barriers which break the
mutual intercourse of men, and form the necessary limits of different States.
But the average height of the Alleghanies does not exceed 2,500 feet; their
greatest elevation is not above 4,000 feet; their rounded summits, and the
spacious valleys which they conceal within their passes, are of easy access
from several sides. Besides which, the principal rivers which fall into the
Atlantic Ocean—the Hudson, the Susquehanna, and the Potomac—take
their rise beyond the Alleghanies, in an open district, which borders upon the
valley of the Mississippi. These streams quit this tract of country, make their
way through the barrier which would seem to turn them westward, and as they
wind through the mountains they open an easy and natural passage to man. No
natural barrier exists in the regions which are now inhabited by the
Anglo-Americans; the Alleghanies are so far from serving as a boundary to
separate nations, that they do not even serve as a frontier to the States. New
York, Pennsylvania, and Virginia comprise them within their borders, and they
extend as much to the west as to the east of the line. The territory now
occupied by the twenty-four States of the Union, and the three great districts
which have not yet acquired the rank of States, although they already contain
inhabitants, covers a surface of 1,002,600 square miles, *c which is about
equal to five times the extent of France. Within these limits the qualities of
the soil, the temperature, and the produce of the country, are extremely
various. The vast extent of territory occupied by the Anglo-American republics
has given rise to doubts as to the maintenance of their Union. Here a
distinction must be made; contrary interests sometimes arise in the different
provinces of a vast empire, which often terminate in open dissensions; and the
extent of the country is then most prejudicial to the power of the State. But
if the inhabitants of these vast regions are not divided by contrary interests,
the extent of the territory may be favorable to their prosperity; for the unity
of the government promotes the interchange of the different productions of the
soil, and increases their value by facilitating their consumption.

[ See “Darby’s View of the United States,” p. 435. [In 1890
the number of States and Territories had increased to 51, the population to
62,831,900, and the area of the States, 3,602,990 square miles. This does not
include the Philippine Islands, Hawaii, or Porto Rico. A conservative estimate
of the population of the Philippine Islands is 8,000,000; that of Hawaii, by
the census of 1897, was given at 109,020; and the present estimated population
of Porto Rico is 900,000. The area of the Philippine Islands is about 120,000
square miles, that of Hawaii is 6,740 square miles, and the area of Porto Rico
is about 3,600 square miles.]]
It is indeed easy to discover different interests in the different parts of the
Union, but I am unacquainted with any which are hostile to each other. The
Southern States are almost exclusively agricultural. The Northern States are
more peculiarly commercial and manufacturing. The States of the West are at the
same time agricultural and manufacturing. In the South the crops consist of
tobacco, of rice, of cotton, and of sugar; in the North and the West, of wheat
and maize. These are different sources of wealth; but union is the means by
which these sources are opened to all, and rendered equally advantageous to the
several districts.
The North, which ships the produce of the Anglo-Americans to all parts of the
world, and brings back the produce of the globe to the Union, is evidently
interested in maintaining the confederation in its present condition, in order
that the number of American producers and consumers may remain as large as
possible. The North is the most natural agent of communication between the
South and the West of the Union on the one hand, and the rest of the world upon
the other; the North is therefore interested in the union and prosperity of the
South and the West, in order that they may continue to furnish raw materials
for its manufactures, and cargoes for its shipping.
The South and the West, on their side, are still more directly interested in
the preservation of the Union, and the prosperity of the North. The produce of
the South is, for the most part, exported beyond seas; the South and the West
consequently stand in need of the commercial resources of the North. They are
likewise interested in the maintenance of a powerful fleet by the Union, to
protect them efficaciously. The South and the West have no vessels, but they
cannot refuse a willing subsidy to defray the expenses of the navy; for if the
fleets of Europe were to blockade the ports of the South and the delta of the
Mississippi, what would become of the rice of the Carolinas, the tobacco of
Virginia, and the sugar and cotton which grow in the valley of the Mississippi?
Every portion of the federal budget does therefore contribute to the
maintenance of material interests which are common to all the confederate
States.
Independently of this commercial utility, the South and the West of the Union
derive great political advantages from their connection with the North. The
South contains an enormous slave population; a population which is already
alarming, and still more formidable for the future. The States of the West lie
in the remotest parts of a single valley; and all the rivers which intersect
their territory rise in the Rocky Mountains or in the Alleghanies, and fall
into the Mississippi, which bears them onwards to the Gulf of Mexico. The
Western States are consequently entirely cut off, by their position, from the
traditions of Europe and the civilization of the Old World. The inhabitants of
the South, then, are induced to support the Union in order to avail themselves
of its protection against the blacks; and the inhabitants of the West in order
not to be excluded from a free communication with the rest of the globe, and
shut up in the wilds of central America. The North cannot but desire the
maintenance of the Union, in order to remain, as it now is, the connecting link
between that vast body and the other parts of the world.
The temporal interests of all the several parts of the Union are, then,
intimately connected; and the same assertion holds true respecting those
opinions and sentiments which may be termed the immaterial interests of men.
The inhabitants of the United States talk a great deal of their attachment to
their country; but I confess that I do not rely upon that calculating
patriotism which is founded upon interest, and which a change in the interests
at stake may obliterate. Nor do I attach much importance to the language of the
Americans, when they manifest, in their daily conversations, the intention of
maintaining the federal system adopted by their forefathers. A government
retains its sway over a great number of citizens, far less by the voluntary and
rational consent of the multitude, than by that instinctive, and to a certain
extent involuntary agreement, which results from similarity of feelings and
resemblances of opinion. I will never admit that men constitute a social body,
simply because they obey the same head and the same laws. Society can only
exist when a great number of men consider a great number of things in the same
point of view; when they hold the same opinions upon many subjects, and when
the same occurrences suggest the same thoughts and impressions to their minds.
The observer who examines the present condition of the United States upon this
principle, will readily discover, that although the citizens are divided into
twenty-four distinct sovereignties, they nevertheless constitute a single
people; and he may perhaps be led to think that the state of the Anglo-American
Union is more truly a state of society than that of certain nations of Europe
which live under the same legislation and the same prince.
Although the Anglo-Americans have several religious sects, they all regard
religion in the same manner. They are not always agreed upon the measures which
are most conducive to good government, and they vary upon some of the forms of
government which it is expedient to adopt; but they are unanimous upon the
general principles which ought to rule human society. From Maine to the
Floridas, and from the Missouri to the Atlantic Ocean, the people is held to be
the legitimate source of all power. The same notions are entertained respecting
liberty and equality, the liberty of the press, the right of association, the
jury, and the responsibility of the agents of Government.
If we turn from their political and religious opinions to the moral and
philosophical principles which regulate the daily actions of life and govern
their conduct, we shall still find the same uniformity. The Anglo-Americans *d
acknowledge the absolute moral authority of the reason of the community, as
they acknowledge the political authority of the mass of citizens; and they hold
that public opinion is the surest arbiter of what is lawful or forbidden, true
or false. The majority of them believe that a man will be led to do what is
just and good by following his own interest rightly understood. They hold that
every man is born in possession of the right of self-government, and that no
one has the right of constraining his fellow-creatures to be happy. They have
all a lively faith in the perfectibility of man; they are of opinion that the
effects of the diffusion of knowledge must necessarily be advantageous, and the
consequences of ignorance fatal; they all consider society as a body in a state
of improvement, humanity as a changing scene, in which nothing is, or ought to
be, permanent; and they admit that what appears to them to be good to-day may
be superseded by something better-to-morrow. I do not give all these opinions
as true, but I quote them as characteristic of the Americans.
d 
[ It is scarcely necessary for me to observe that by the expression
Anglo-Americans, I only mean to designate the great majority of the nation; for
a certain number of isolated individuals are of course to be met with holding
very different opinions.]
The Anglo-Americans are not only united together by these common opinions, but
they are separated from all other nations by a common feeling of pride. For the
last fifty years no pains have been spared to convince the inhabitants of the
United States that they constitute the only religious, enlightened, and free
people. They perceive that, for the present, their own democratic institutions
succeed, whilst those of other countries fail; hence they conceive an
overweening opinion of their superiority, and they are not very remote from
believing themselves to belong to a distinct race of mankind.
The dangers which threaten the American Union do not originate in the diversity
of interests or of opinions, but in the various characters and passions of the
Americans. The men who inhabit the vast territory of the United States are
almost all the issue of a common stock; but the effects of the climate, and
more especially of slavery, have gradually introduced very striking differences
between the British settler of the Southern States and the British settler of
the North. In Europe it is generally believed that slavery has rendered the
interests of one part of the Union contrary to those of another part; but I by
no means remarked this to be the case: slavery has not created interests in the
South contrary to those of the North, but it has modified the character and
changed the habits of the natives of the South.
I have already explained the influence which slavery has exercised upon the
commercial ability of the Americans in the South; and this same influence
equally extends to their manners. The slave is a servant who never
remonstrates, and who submits to everything without complaint. He may sometimes
assassinate, but he never withstands, his master. In the South there are no
families so poor as not to have slaves. The citizen of the Southern States of
the Union is invested with a sort of domestic dictatorship, from his earliest
years; the first notion he acquires in life is that he is born to command, and
the first habit which he contracts is that of being obeyed without resistance.
His education tends, then, to give him the character of a supercilious and a
hasty man; irascible, violent, and ardent in his desires, impatient of
obstacles, but easily discouraged if he cannot succeed upon his first attempt.
The American of the Northern States is surrounded by no slaves in his
childhood; he is even unattended by free servants, and is usually obliged to
provide for his own wants. No sooner does he enter the world than the idea of
necessity assails him on every side: he soon learns to know exactly the natural
limit of his authority; he never expects to subdue those who withstand him, by
force; and he knows that the surest means of obtaining the support of his
fellow-creatures, is to win their favor. He therefore becomes patient,
reflecting, tolerant, slow to act, and persevering in his designs.
In the Southern States the more immediate wants of life are always supplied;
the inhabitants of those parts are not busied in the material cares of life,
which are always provided for by others; and their imagination is diverted to
more captivating and less definite objects. The American of the South is fond
of grandeur, luxury, and renown, of gayety, of pleasure, and above all of
idleness; nothing obliges him to exert himself in order to subsist; and as he
has no necessary occupations, he gives way to indolence, and does not even
attempt what would be useful.
But the equality of fortunes, and the absence of slavery in the North, plunge
the inhabitants in those same cares of daily life which are disdained by the
white population of the South. They are taught from infancy to combat want, and
to place comfort above all the pleasures of the intellect or the heart. The
imagination is extinguished by the trivial details of life, and the ideas
become less numerous and less general, but far more practical and more precise.
As prosperity is the sole aim of exertion, it is excellently well attained;
nature and mankind are turned to the best pecuniary advantage, and society is
dexterously made to contribute to the welfare of each of its members, whilst
individual egotism is the source of general happiness.
The citizen of the North has not only experience, but knowledge: nevertheless
he sets but little value upon the pleasures of knowledge; he esteems it as the
means of attaining a certain end, and he is only anxious to seize its more
lucrative applications. The citizen of the South is more given to act upon
impulse; he is more clever, more frank, more generous, more intellectual, and
more brilliant. The former, with a greater degree of activity, of common-sense,
of information, and of general aptitude, has the characteristic good and evil
qualities of the middle classes. The latter has the tastes, the prejudices, the
weaknesses, and the magnanimity of all aristocracies. If two men are united in
society, who have the same interests, and to a certain extent the same
opinions, but different characters, different acquirements, and a different
style of civilization, it is probable that these men will not agree. The same
remark is applicable to a society of nations. Slavery, then, does not attack
the American Union directly in its interests, but indirectly in its manners.

[ Census of 1790, 3,929,328; 1830, 12,856,165; 1860, 31,443,321; 1870,
38,555,983; 1890, 62,831,900.]
The States which gave their assent to the federal contract in 1790 were
thirteen in number; the Union now consists of thirty-four members. The
population, which amounted to nearly 4,000,000 in 1790, had more than tripled
in the space of forty years; and in 1830 it amounted to nearly 13,000,000. *e
Changes of such magnitude cannot take place without some danger.
A society of nations, as well as a society of individuals, derives its
principal chances of duration from the wisdom of its members, their individual
weakness, and their limited number. The Americans who quit the coasts of the
Atlantic Ocean to plunge into the western wilderness, are adventurers impatient
of restraint, greedy of wealth, and frequently men expelled from the States in
which they were born. When they arrive in the deserts they are unknown to each
other, and they have neither traditions, family feeling, nor the force of
example to check their excesses. The empire of the laws is feeble amongst them;
that of morality is still more powerless. The settlers who are constantly
peopling the valley of the Mississippi are, then, in every respect very
inferior to the Americans who inhabit the older parts of the Union.
Nevertheless, they already exercise a great influence in its councils; and they
arrive at the government of the commonwealth before they have learnt to govern
themselves. *f
f 
[ This indeed is only a temporary danger. I have no doubt that in time society
will assume as much stability and regularity in the West as it has already done
upon the coast of the Atlantic Ocean.]
The greater the individual weakness of each of the contracting parties, the
greater are the chances of the duration of the contract; for their safety is
then dependent upon their union. When, in 1790, the most populous of the
American republics did not contain 500,000 inhabitants, *g each of them felt
its own insignificance as an independent people, and this feeling rendered
compliance with the federal authority more easy. But when one of the
confederate States reckons, like the State of New York, 2,000,000 of
inhabitants, and covers an extent of territory equal in surface to a quarter of
France, *h it feels its own strength; and although it may continue to support
the Union as advantageous to its prosperity, it no longer regards that body as
necessary to its existence, and as it continues to belong to the federal
compact, it soon aims at preponderance in the federal assemblies. The probable
unanimity of the States is diminished as their number increases. At present the
interests of the different parts of the Union are not at variance; but who is
able to foresee the multifarious changes of the future, in a country in which
towns are founded from day to day, and States almost from year to year?
g 
[ Pennsylvania contained 431,373 inhabitants in 1790 [and 5,258,014 in 1890.]]
h 
[ The area of the State of New York is 49,170 square miles. [See U. S. census
report of 1890.]]
Since the first settlement of the British colonies, the number of inhabitants
has about doubled every twenty-two years. I perceive no causes which are likely
to check this progressive increase of the Anglo-American population for the
next hundred years; and before that space of time has elapsed, I believe that
the territories and dependencies of the United States will be covered by more
than 100,000,000 of inhabitants, and divided into forty States. *i I admit that
these 100,000,000 of men have no hostile interests. I suppose, on the contrary,
that they are all equally interested in the maintenance of the Union; but I am
still of opinion that where there are 100,000,000 of men, and forty distinct
nations, unequally strong, the continuance of the Federal Government can only
be a fortunate accident.
i 
[ If the population continues to double every twenty-two years, as it has done
for the last two hundred years, the number of inhabitants in the United States
in 1852 will be twenty millions; in 1874, forty-eight millions; and in 1896,
ninety-six millions. This may still be the case even if the lands on the
western slope of the Rocky Mountains should be found to be unfit for
cultivation. The territory which is already occupied can easily contain this
number of inhabitants. One hundred millions of men disseminated over the
surface of the twenty-four States, and the three dependencies, which constitute
the Union, would only give 762 inhabitants to the square league; this would be
far below the mean population of France, which is 1,063 to the square league;
or of England, which is 1,457; and it would even be below the population of
Switzerland, for that country, notwithstanding its lakes and mountains,
contains 783 inhabitants to the square league. See “Malte Brun,”
vol. vi. p. 92.
[The actual result has fallen somewhat short of these calculations, in spite of
the vast territorial acquisitions of the United States: but in 1899 the
population is probably about eighty-seven millions, including the population of
the Philippines, Hawaii, and Porto Rico.]]
Whatever faith I may have in the perfectibility of man, until human nature is
altered, and men wholly transformed, I shall refuse to believe in the duration
of a government which is called upon to hold together forty different peoples,
disseminated over a territory equal to one-half of Europe in extent; to avoid
all rivalry, ambition, and struggles between them, and to direct their
independent activity to the accomplishment of the same designs.
But the greatest peril to which the Union is exposed by its increase arises
from the continual changes which take place in the position of its internal
strength. The distance from Lake Superior to the Gulf of Mexico extends from
the 47th to the 30th degree of latitude, a distance of more than 1,200 miles as
the bird flies. The frontier of the United States winds along the whole of this
immense line, sometimes falling within its limits, but more frequently
extending far beyond it, into the waste. It has been calculated that the whites
advance every year a mean distance of seventeen miles along the whole of his
vast boundary. *j Obstacles, such as an unproductive district, a lake or an
Indian nation unexpectedly encountered, are sometimes met with. The advancing
column then halts for a while; its two extremities fall back upon themselves,
and as soon as they are reunited they proceed onwards. This gradual and
continuous progress of the European race towards the Rocky Mountains has the
solemnity of a providential event; it is like a deluge of men rising
unabatedly, and daily driven onwards by the hand of God.
j 
[ See Legislative Documents, 20th Congress, No. 117, p. 105.]
Within this first line of conquering settlers towns are built, and vast States
founded. In 1790 there were only a few thousand pioneers sprinkled along the
valleys of the Mississippi; and at the present day these valleys contain as
many inhabitants as were to be found in the whole Union in 1790. Their
population amounts to nearly 4,000,000. *k The city of Washington was founded
in 1800, in the very centre of the Union; but such are the changes which have
taken place, that it now stands at one of the extremities; and the delegates of
the most remote Western States are already obliged to perform a journey as long
as that from Vienna to Paris. *l
k 
[ 3,672,317—Census of 1830.]
l 
[ The distance from Jefferson, the capital of the State of Missouri, to
Washington is 1,019 miles. (“American Almanac,” 1831, p. 48.)]
All the States are borne onwards at the same time in the path of fortune, but
of course they do not all increase and prosper in the same proportion. To the
North of the Union the detached branches of the Alleghany chain, which extend
as far as the Atlantic Ocean, form spacious roads and ports, which are
constantly accessible to vessels of the greatest burden. But from the Potomac
to the mouth of the Mississippi the coast is sandy and flat. In this part of
the Union the mouths of almost all the rivers are obstructed; and the few
harbors which exist amongst these lagoons afford much shallower water to
vessels, and much fewer commercial advantages than those of the North.
This first natural cause of inferiority is united to another cause proceeding
from the laws. We have already seen that slavery, which is abolished in the
North, still exists in the South; and I have pointed out its fatal consequences
upon the prosperity of the planter himself.
The North is therefore superior to the South both in commerce *m and
manufacture; the natural consequence of which is the more rapid increase of
population and of wealth within its borders. The States situate upon the shores
of the Atlantic Ocean are already half-peopled. Most of the land is held by an
owner; and these districts cannot therefore receive so many emigrants as the
Western States, where a boundless field is still open to their exertions. The
valley of the Mississippi is far more fertile than the coast of the Atlantic
Ocean. This reason, added to all the others, contributes to drive the Europeans
westward—a fact which may be rigorously demonstrated by figures. It is
found that the sum total of the population of all the United States has about
tripled in the course of forty years. But in the recent States adjacent to the
Mississippi, the population has increased thirty-one-fold, within the same
space of time. *n
m 
[ The following statements will suffice to show the difference which exists
between the commerce of the South and that of the North:—
In 1829 the tonnage of all the merchant vessels belonging to Virginia, the two
Carolinas, and Georgia (the four great Southern States), amounted to only 5,243
tons. In the same year the tonnage of the vessels of the State of Massachusetts
alone amounted to 17,322 tons. (See Legislative Documents, 21st Congress, 2d
session, No. 140, p. 244.) Thus the State of Massachusetts had three times as
much shipping as the four above-mentioned States. Nevertheless the area of the
State of Massachusetts is only 7,335 square miles, and its population amounts
to 610,014 inhabitants [2,238,943 in 1890]; whilst the area of the four other
States I have quoted is 210,000 square miles, and their population 3,047,767.
Thus the area of the State of Massachusetts forms only one-thirtieth part of
the area of the four States; and its population is five times smaller than
theirs. (See “Darby’s View of the United States.”) Slavery is
prejudicial to the commercial prosperity of the South in several different
ways; by diminishing the spirit of enterprise amongst the whites, and by
preventing them from meeting with as numerous a class of sailors as they
require. Sailors are usually taken from the lowest ranks of the population. But
in the Southern States these lowest ranks are composed of slaves, and it is
very difficult to employ them at sea. They are unable to serve as well as a
white crew, and apprehensions would always be entertained of their mutinying in
the middle of the ocean, or of their escaping in the foreign countries at which
they might touch.]

[ “Darby’s View of the United States,” p. 444.]
The relative position of the central federal power is continually displaced.
Forty years ago the majority of the citizens of the Union was established upon
the coast of the Atlantic, in the environs of the spot upon which Washington
now stands; but the great body of the people is now advancing inland and to the
north, so that in twenty years the majority will unquestionably be on the
western side of the Alleghanies. If the Union goes on to subsist, the basin of
the Mississippi is evidently marked out, by its fertility and its extent, as
the future centre of the Federal Government. In thirty or forty years, that
tract of country will have assumed the rank which naturally belongs to it. It
is easy to calculate that its population, compared to that of the coast of the
Atlantic, will be, in round numbers, as 40 to 11. In a few years the States
which founded the Union will lose the direction of its policy, and the
population of the valley of the Mississippi will preponderate in the federal
assemblies.
This constant gravitation of the federal power and influence towards the
northwest is shown every ten years, when a general census of the population is
made, and the number of delegates which each State sends to Congress is settled
afresh. *o In 1790 Virginia had nineteen representatives in Congress. This
number continued to increase until the year 1813, when it reached to
twenty-three; from that time it began to decrease, and in 1833 Virginia elected
only twenty-one representatives. *p During the same period the State of New
York progressed in the contrary direction: in 1790 it had ten representatives
in Congress; in 1813, twenty-seven; in 1823, thirty-four; and in 1833, forty.
The State of Ohio had only one representative in 1803, and in 1833 it had
already nineteen.
o 
[ It may be seen that in the course of the last ten years (1820-1830) the
population of one district, as, for instance, the State of Delaware, has
increased in the proportion of five per cent.; whilst that of another, as the
territory of Michigan, has increased 250 per cent. Thus the population of
Virginia had augmented thirteen per cent., and that of the border State of Ohio
sixty-one per cent., in the same space of time. The general table of these
changes, which is given in the “National Calendar,” displays a
striking picture of the unequal fortunes of the different States.]
p 
[ It has just been said that in the course of the last term the population of
Virginia has increased thirteen per cent.; and it is necessary to explain how
the number of representatives for a State may decrease, when the population of
that State, far from diminishing, is actually upon the increase. I take the
State of Virginia, to which I have already alluded, as my term of comparison.
The number of representatives of Virginia in 1823 was proportionate to the
total number of the representatives of the Union, and to the relation which the
population bore to that of the whole Union: in 1833 the number of
representatives of Virginia was likewise proportionate to the total number of
the representatives of the Union, and to the relation which its population,
augmented in the course of ten years, bore to the augmented population of the
Union in the same space of time. The new number of Virginian representatives
will then be to the old numver, on the one hand, as the new numver of all the
representatives is to the old number; and, on the other hand, as the
augmentation of the population of Virginia is to that of the whole population
of the country. Thus, if the increase of the population of the lesser country
be to that of the greater in an exact inverse ratio of the proportion between
the new and the old numbers of all the representatives, the number of the
representatives of Virginia will remain stationary; and if the increase of the
Virginian population be to that of the whole Union in a feeblerratio than the
new number of the representatives of the Union to the old number, the number of
the representatives of Virginia must decrease. [Thus, to the 56th Congress in
1899, Virginia and West Virginia send only fourteen representatives.]]
It is difficult to imagine a durable union of a people which is rich and strong
with one which is poor and weak, even if it were proved that the strength and
wealth of the one are not the causes of the weakness and poverty of the other.
But union is still more difficult to maintain at a time at which one party is
losing strength, and the other is gaining it. This rapid and disproportionate
increase of certain States threatens the independence of the others. New York
might perhaps succeed, with its 2,000,000 of inhabitants and its forty
representatives, in dictating to the other States in Congress. But even if the
more powerful States make no attempt to bear down the lesser ones, the danger
still exists; for there is almost as much in the possibility of the act as in
the act itself. The weak generally mistrust the justice and the reason of the
strong. The States which increase less rapidly than the others look upon those
which are more favored by fortune with envy and suspicion. Hence arise the
deep-seated uneasiness and ill-defined agitation which are observable in the
South, and which form so striking a contrast to the confidence and prosperity
which are common to other parts of the Union. I am inclined to think that the
hostile measures taken by the Southern provinces upon a recent occasion are
attributable to no other cause. The inhabitants of the Southern States are, of
all the Americans, those who are most interested in the maintenance of the
Union; they would assuredly suffer most from being left to themselves; and yet
they are the only citizens who threaten to break the tie of confederation. But
it is easy to perceive that the South, which has given four Presidents,
Washington, Jefferson, Madison, and Monroe, to the Union, which perceives that
it is losing its federal influence, and that the number of its representatives
in Congress is diminishing from year to year, whilst those of the Northern and
Western States are increasing; the South, which is peopled with ardent and
irascible beings, is becoming more and more irritated and alarmed. The citizens
reflect upon their present position and remember their past influence, with the
melancholy uneasiness of men who suspect oppression: if they discover a law of
the Union which is not unequivocally favorable to their interests, they protest
against it as an abuse of force; and if their ardent remonstrances are not
listened to, they threaten to quit an association which loads them with burdens
whilst it deprives them of their due profits. “The tariff,” said
the inhabitants of Carolina in 1832, “enriches the North, and ruins the
South; for if this were not the case, to what can we attribute the continually
increasing power and wealth of the North, with its inclement skies and arid
soil; whilst the South, which may be styled the garden of America, is rapidly
declining?” *q
q 
[ See the report of its committee to the Convention which proclaimed the
nullification of the tariff in South Carolina.]
If the changes which I have described were gradual, so that each generation at
least might have time to disappear with the order of things under which it had
lived, the danger would be less; but the progress of society in America is
precipitate, and almost revolutionary. The same citizen may have lived to see
his State take the lead in the Union, and afterwards become powerless in the
federal assemblies; and an Anglo-American republic has been known to grow as
rapidly as a man passing from birth and infancy to maturity in the course of
thirty years. It must not be imagined, however, that the States which lose
their preponderance, also lose their population or their riches: no stop is put
to their prosperity, and they even go on to increase more rapidly than any
kingdom in Europe. *r But they believe themselves to be impoverished because
their wealth does not augment as rapidly as that of their neighbors; any they
think that their power is lost, because they suddenly come into collision with
a power greater than their own: *s thus they are more hurt in their feelings
and their passions than in their interests. But this is amply sufficient to
endanger the maintenance of the Union. If kings and peoples had only had their
true interests in view ever since the beginning of the world, the name of war
would scarcely be known among mankind.
r 
[ The population of a country assuredly constitutes the first element of its
wealth. In the ten years (1820-1830) during which Virginia lost two of its
representatives in Congress, its population increased in the proportion of 13.7
per cent.; that of Carolina in the proportion of fifteen per cent.; and that of
Georgia, 15.5 per cent. (See the “American Almanac,” 1832, p. 162)
But the population of Russia, which increases more rapidly than that of any
other European country, only augments in ten years at the rate of 9.5 per
cent.; in France, at the rate of seven per cent.; and in Europe in general, at
the rate of 4.7 per cent. (See “Malte Brun,” vol. vi. p. 95)]
s 
[ It must be admitted, however, that the depreciation which has taken place in
the value of tobacco, during the last fifty years, has notably diminished the
opulence of the Southern planters: but this circumstance is as independent of
the will of their Northern brethren as it is of their own.]
Thus the prosperity of the United States is the source of the most serious
dangers that threaten them, since it tends to create in some of the confederate
States that over-excitement which accompanies a rapid increase of fortune; and
to awaken in others those feelings of envy, mistrust, and regret which usually
attend upon the loss of it. The Americans contemplate this extraordinary and
hasty progress with exultation; but they would be wiser to consider it with
sorrow and alarm. The Americans of the United States must inevitably become one
of the greatest nations in the world; their offset will cover almost the whole
of North America; the continent which they inhabit is their dominion, and it
cannot escape them. What urges them to take possession of it so soon? Riches,
power, and renown cannot fail to be theirs at some future time, but they rush
upon their fortune as if but a moment remained for them to make it their own.
I think that I have demonstrated that the existence of the present
confederation depends entirely on the continued assent of all the confederates;
and, starting from this principle, I have inquired into the causes which may
induce the several States to separate from the others. The Union may, however,
perish in two different ways: one of the confederate States may choose to
retire from the compact, and so forcibly to sever the federal tie; and it is to
this supposition that most of the remarks that I have made apply: or the
authority of the Federal Government may be progressively entrenched on by the
simultaneous tendency of the united republics to resume their independence. The
central power, successively stripped of all its prerogatives, and reduced to
impotence by tacit consent, would become incompetent to fulfil its purpose; and
the second Union would perish, like the first, by a sort of senile inaptitude.
The gradual weakening of the federal tie, which may finally lead to the
dissolution of the Union, is a distinct circumstance, that may produce a
variety of minor consequences before it operates so violent a change. The
confederation might still subsist, although its Government were reduced to such
a degree of inanition as to paralyze the nation, to cause internal anarchy, and
to check the general prosperity of the country.
After having investigated the causes which may induce the Anglo-Americans to
disunite, it is important to inquire whether, if the Union continues to
subsist, their Government will extend or contract its sphere of action, and
whether it will become more energetic or more weak.
The Americans are evidently disposed to look upon their future condition with
alarm. They perceive that in most of the nations of the world the exercise of
the rights of sovereignty tends to fall under the control of a few individuals,
and they are dismayed by the idea that such will also be the case in their own
country. Even the statesmen feel, or affect to feel, these fears; for, in
America, centralization is by no means popular, and there is no surer means of
courting the majority than by inveighing against the encroachments of the
central power. The Americans do not perceive that the countries in which this
alarming tendency to centralization exists are inhabited by a single people;
whilst the fact of the Union being composed of different confederate
communities is sufficient to baffle all the inferences which might be drawn
from analogous circumstances. I confess that I am inclined to consider the
fears of a great number of Americans as purely imaginary; and far from
participating in their dread of the consolidation of power in the hands of the
Union, I think that the Federal Government is visibly losing strength.
To prove this assertion I shall not have recourse to any remote occurrences,
but to circumstances which I have myself witnessed, and which belong to our own
time.
An attentive examination of what is going on in the United States will easily
convince us that two opposite tendencies exist in that country, like two
distinct currents flowing in contrary directions in the same channel. The Union
has now existed for forty-five years, and in the course of that time a vast
number of provincial prejudices, which were at first hostile to its power, have
died away. The patriotic feeling which attached each of the Americans to his
own native State is become less exclusive; and the different parts of the Union
have become more intimately connected the better they have become acquainted
with each other. The post, *t that great instrument of intellectual
intercourse, now reaches into the backwoods; and steamboats have established
daily means of communication between the different points of the coast. An
inland navigation of unexampled rapidity conveys commodities up and down the
rivers of the country. *u And to these facilities of nature and art may be
added those restless cravings, that busy-mindedness, and love of pelf, which
are constantly urging the American into active life, and bringing him into
contact with his fellow-citizens. He crosses the country in every direction; he
visits all the various populations of the land; and there is not a province in
France in which the natives are so well known to each other as the 13,000,000
of men who cover the territory of the United States.
t 
[ In 1832, the district of Michigan, which only contains 31,639 inhabitants,
and is still an almost unexplored wilderness, possessed 940 miles of
mail-roads. The territory of Arkansas, which is still more uncultivated, was
already intersected by 1,938 miles of mail-roads. (See the report of the
General Post Office, November 30, 1833.) The postage of newspapers alone in the
whole Union amounted to $254,796.]
u 
[ In the course of ten years, from 1821 to 1831, 271 steamboats have been
launched upon the rivers which water the valley of the Mississippi alone. In
1829 259 steamboats existed in the United States. (See Legislative Documents,
No. 140, p. 274.)]
But whilst the Americans intermingle, they grow in resemblance of each other;
the differences resulting from their climate, their origin, and their
institutions, diminish; and they all draw nearer and nearer to the common type.
Every year, thousands of men leave the North to settle in different parts of
the Union: they bring with them their faith, their opinions, and their manners;
and as they are more enlighthned than the men amongst whom they are about to
dwell, they soon rise to the head of affairs, and they adapt society to their
own advantage. This continual emigration of the North to the South is
peculiarly favorable to the fusion of all the different provincial characters
into one national character. The civilization of the North appears to be the
common standard, to which the whole nation will one day be assimilated.
The commercial ties which unite the confederate States are strengthened by the
increasing manufactures of the Americans; and the union which began to exist in
their opinions, gradually forms a part of their habits: the course of time has
swept away the bugbear thoughts which haunted the imaginations of the citizens
in 1789. The federal power is not become oppressive; it has not destroyed the
independence of the States; it has not subjected the confederates to monarchial
institutions; and the Union has not rendered the lesser States dependent upon
the larger ones; but the confederation has continued to increase in population,
in wealth, and in power. I am therefore convinced that the natural obstacles to
the continuance of the American Union are not so powerful at the present time
as they were in 1789; and that the enemies of the Union are not so numerous.
Nevertheless, a careful examination of the history of the United States for the
last forty-five years will readily convince us that the federal power is
declining; nor is it difficult to explain the causes of this phenomenon. *v
When the Constitution of 1789 was promulgated, the nation was a prey to
anarchy; the Union, which succeeded this confusion, excited much dread and much
animosity; but it was warmly supported because it satisfied an imperious want.
Thus, although it was more attacked than it is now, the federal power soon
reached the maximum of its authority, as is usually the case with a government
which triumphs after having braced its strength by the struggle. At that time
the interpretation of the Constitution seemed to extend, rather than to
repress, the federal sovereignty; and the Union offered, in several respects,
the appearance of a single and undivided people, directed in its foreign and
internal policy by a single Government. But to attain this point the people had
risen, to a certain extent, above itself.
v 
[ [Since 1861 the movement is certainly in the opposite direction, and the
federal power has largely increased, and tends to further increase.]]
The Constitution had not destroyed the distinct sovereignty of the States; and
all communities, of whatever nature they may be, are impelled by a secret
propensity to assert their independence. This propensity is still more decided
in a country like America, in which every village forms a sort of republic
accustomed to conduct its own affairs. It therefore cost the States an effort
to submit to the federal supremacy; and all efforts, however successful they
may be, necessarily subside with the causes in which they originated.
As the Federal Government consolidated its authority, America resumed its rank
amongst the nations, peace returned to its frontiers, and public credit was
restored; confusion was succeeded by a fixed state of things, which was
favorable to the full and free exercise of industrious enterprise. It was this
very prosperity which made the Americans forget the cause to which it was
attributable; and when once the danger was passed, the energy and the
patriotism which had enabled them to brave it disappeared from amongst them. No
sooner were they delivered from the cares which oppressed them, than they
easily returned to their ordinary habits, and gave themselves up without
resistance to their natural inclinations. When a powerful Government no longer
appeared to be necessary, they once more began to think it irksome. The Union
encouraged a general prosperity, and the States were not inclined to abandon
the Union; but they desired to render the action of the power which represented
that body as light as possible. The general principle of Union was adopted, but
in every minor detail there was an actual tendency to independence. The
principle of confederation was every day more easily admitted, and more rarely
applied; so that the Federal Government brought about its own decline, whilst
it was creating order and peace.
As soon as this tendency of public opinion began to be manifested externally,
the leaders of parties, who live by the passions of the people, began to work
it to their own advantage. The position of the Federal Government then became
exceedingly critical. Its enemies were in possession of the popular favor; and
they obtained the right of conducting its policy by pledging themselves to
lessen its influence. From that time forwards the Government of the Union has
invariably been obliged to recede, as often as it has attempted to enter the
lists with the governments of the States. And whenever an interpretation of the
terms of the Federal Constitution has been called for, that interpretation has
most frequently been opposed to the Union, and favorable to the States.
The Constitution invested the Federal Government with the right of providing
for the interests of the nation; and it had been held that no other authority
was so fit to superintend the “internal improvements” which
affected the prosperity of the whole Union; such, for instance, as the cutting
of canals. But the States were alarmed at a power, distinct from their own,
which could thus dispose of a portion of their territory; and they were afraid
that the central Government would, by this means, acquire a formidable extent
of patronage within their own confines, and exercise a degree of influence
which they intended to reserve exclusively to their own agents. The Democratic
party, which has constantly been opposed to the increase of the federal
authority, then accused the Congress of usurpation, and the Chief Magistrate of
ambition. The central Government was intimidated by the opposition; and it soon
acknowledged its error, promising exactly to confine its influence for the
future within the circle which was prescribed to it.
The Constitution confers upon the Union the right of treating with foreign
nations. The Indian tribes, which border upon the frontiers of the United
States, had usually been regarded in this light. As long as these savages
consented to retire before the civilized settlers, the federal right was not
contested: but as soon as an Indian tribe attempted to fix its dwelling upon a
given spot, the adjacent States claimed possession of the lands and the rights
of sovereignty over the natives. The central Government soon recognized both
these claims; and after it had concluded treaties with the Indians as
independent nations, it gave them up as subjects to the legislative tyranny of
the States. *w
w 
[ See in the Legislative Documents, already quoted in speaking of the Indians,
the letter of the President of the United States to the Cherokees, his
correspondence on this subject with his agents, and his messages to Congress.]
Some of the States which had been founded upon the coast of the Atlantic,
extended indefinitely to the West, into wild regions where no European had ever
penetrated. The States whose confines were irrevocably fixed, looked with a
jealous eye upon the unbounded regions which the future would enable their
neighbors to explore. The latter then agreed, with a view to conciliate the
others, and to facilitate the act of union, to lay down their own boundaries,
and to abandon all the territory which lay beyond those limits to the
confederation at large. *x Thenceforward the Federal Government became the
owner of all the uncultivated lands which lie beyond the borders of the
thirteen States first confederated. It was invested with the right of
parcelling and selling them, and the sums derived from this source were
exclusively reserved to the public treasure of the Union, in order to furnish
supplies for purchasing tracts of country from the Indians, for opening roads
to the remote settlements, and for accelerating the increase of civilization as
much as possible. New States have, however, been formed in the course of time,
in the midst of those wilds which were formerly ceded by the inhabitants of the
shores of the Atlantic. Congress has gone on to sell, for the profit of the
nation at large, the uncultivated lands which those new States contained. But
the latter at length asserted that, as they were now fully constituted, they
ought to enjoy the exclusive right of converting the produce of these sales to
their own use. As their remonstrances became more and more threatening,
Congress thought fit to deprive the Union of a portion of the privileges which
it had hitherto enjoyed; and at the end of 1832 it passed a law by which the
greatest part of the revenue derived from the sale of lands was made over to
the new western republics, although the lands themselves were not ceded to
them. *y
x 
[ The first act of session was made by the State of New York in 1780; Virginia,
Massachusetts, Connecticut, South and North Carolina, followed this example at
different times, and lastly, the act of cession of Georgia was made as recently
as 1802.]
y 
[ It is true that the President refused his assent to this law; but he
completely adopted it in principle. (See Message of December 8, 1833.)]
The slightest observation in the United States enables one to appreciate the
advantages which the country derives from the bank. These advantages are of
several kinds, but one of them is peculiarly striking to the stranger. The
banknotes of the United States are taken upon the borders of the desert for the
same value as at Philadelphia, where the bank conducts its operations. *z
z 
[ The present Bank of the United States was established in 1816, with a capital
of $35,000,000; its charter expires in 1836. Last year Congress passed a law to
renew it, but the President put his veto upon the bill. The struggle is still
going on with great violence on either side, and the speedy fall of the bank
may easily be foreseen. [It was soon afterwards extinguished by General
Jackson.]]
The Bank of the United States is nevertheless the object of great animosity.
Its directors have proclaimed their hostility to the President: and they are
accused, not without some show of probability, of having abused their influence
to thwart his election. The President therefore attacks the establishment which
they represent with all the warmth of personal enmity; and he is encouraged in
the pursuit of his revenge by the conviction that he is supported by the secret
propensities of the majority. The bank may be regarded as the great monetary
tie of the Union, just as Congress is the great legislative tie; and the same
passions which tend to render the States independent of the central power,
contribute to the overthrow of the bank.
The Bank of the United States always holds a great number of the notes issued
by the provincial banks, which it can at any time oblige them to convert into
cash. It has itself nothing to fear from a similar demand, as the extent of its
resources enables it to meet all claims. But the existence of the provincial
banks is thus threatened, and their operations are restricted, since they are
only able to issue a quantity of notes duly proportioned to their capital. They
submit with impatience to this salutary control. The newspapers which they have
bought over, and the President, whose interest renders him their instrument,
attack the bank with the greatest vehemence. They rouse the local passions and
the blind democratic instinct of the country to aid their cause; and they
assert that the bank directors form a permanent aristocratic body, whose
influence must ultimately be felt in the Government, and must affect those
principles of equality upon which society rests in America.
The contest between the bank and its opponents is only an incident in the great
struggle which is going on in America between the provinces and the central
power; between the spirit of democratic independence and the spirit of
gradation and subordination. I do not mean that the enemies of the bank are
identically the same individuals who, on other points, attack the Federal
Government; but I assert that the attacks directed against the bank of the
United States originate in the same propensities which militate against the
Federal Government; and that the very numerous opponents of the former afford a
deplorable symptom of the decreasing support of the latter.
The Union has never displayed so much weakness as in the celebrated question of
the tariff. *a The wars of the French Revolution and of 1812 had created
manufacturing establishments in the North of the Union, by cutting off all free
communication between America and Europe. When peace was concluded, and the
channel of intercourse reopened by which the produce of Europe was transmitted
to the New World, the Americans thought fit to establish a system of import
duties, for the twofold purpose of protecting their incipient manufactures and
of paying off the amount of the debt contracted during the war. The Southern
States, which have no manufactures to encourage, and which are exclusively
agricultural, soon complained of this measure. Such were the simple facts, and
I do not pretend to examine in this place whether their complaints were well
founded or unjust.
a 
[ See principally for the details of this affair, the Legislative Documents,
22d Congress, 2d Session, No. 30.]
As early as the year 1820, South Carolina declared, in a petition to Congress,
that the tariff was “unconstitutional, oppressive, and unjust.” And
the States of Georgia, Virginia, North Carolina, Alabama, and Mississippi
subsequently remonstrated against it with more or less vigor. But Congress, far
from lending an ear to these complaints, raised the scale of tariff duties in
the years 1824 and 1828, and recognized anew the principle on which it was
founded. A doctrine was then proclaimed, or rather revived, in the South, which
took the name of Nullification.
I have shown in the proper place that the object of the Federal Constitution
was not to form a league, but to create a national government. The Americans of
the United States form a sole and undivided people, in all the cases which are
specified by that Constitution; and upon these points the will of the nation is
expressed, as it is in all constitutional nations, by the voice of the
majority. When the majority has pronounced its decision, it is the duty of the
minority to submit. Such is the sound legal doctrine, and the only one which
agrees with the text of the Constitution, and the known intention of those who
framed it.
The partisans of Nullification in the South maintain, on the contrary, that the
intention of the Americans in uniting was not to reduce themselves to the
condition of one and the same people; that they meant to constitute a league of
independent States; and that each State, consequently retains its entire
sovereignty, if not de facto, at least de jure; and has the right of putting
its own construction upon the laws of Congress, and of suspending their
execution within the limits of its own territory, if they are held to be
unconstitutional and unjust.
The entire doctrine of Nullification is comprised in a sentence uttered by
Vice-President Calhoun, the head of that party in the South, before the Senate
of the United States, in the year 1833: “The Constitution is a
compact to which the States were parties in their sovereign capacity; now,
whenever a compact is entered into by parties which acknowledge no tribunal
above their authority to decide in the last resort, each of them has a right to
judge for itself in relation to the nature, extent, and obligations of the
instrument.” It is evident that a similar doctrine destroys the very
basis of the Federal Constitution, and brings back all the evils of the old
confederation, from which the Americans were supposed to have had a safe
deliverance.
When South Carolina perceived that Congress turned a deaf ear to its
remonstrances, it threatened to apply the doctrine of nullification to the
federal tariff bill. Congress persisted in its former system; and at length the
storm broke out. In the course of 1832 the citizens of South Carolina, *b named
a national Convention, to consult upon the extraordinary measures which they
were called upon to take; and on November 24th of the same year this Convention
promulgated a law, under the form of a decree, which annulled the federal law
of the tariff, forbade the levy of the imposts which that law commands, and
refused to recognize the appeal which might be made to the federal courts of
law. *c This decree was only to be put in execution in the ensuing month of
February, and it was intimated, that if Congress modified the tariff before
that period, South Carolina might be induced to proceed no further with her
menaces; and a vague desire was afterwards expressed of submitting the question
to an extraordinary assembly of all the confederate States.
b 
[ That is to say, the majority of the people; for the opposite party, called
the Union party, always formed a very strong and active minority. Carolina may
contain about 47,000 electors; 30,000 were in favor of nullification, and
17,000 opposed to it.]
c 
[ This decree was preceded by a report of the committee by which it was framed,
containing the explanation of the motives and object of the law. The following
passage occurs in it, p. 34:—“When the rights reserved by the
Constitution to the different States are deliberately violated, it is the duty
and the right of those States to interfere, in order to check the progress of
the evil; to resist usurpation, and to maintain, within their respective
limits, those powers and privileges which belong to them as independent
sovereign States. If they were destitute of this right, they would not be
sovereign. South Carolina declares that she acknowledges no tribunal upon earth
above her authority. She has indeed entered into a solemn compact of union with
the other States; but she demands, and will exercise, the right of putting her
own construction upon it; and when this compact is violated by her sister
States, and by the Government which they have created, she is determined to
avail herself of the unquestionable right of judging what is the extent of the
infraction, and what are the measures best fitted to obtain justice.”]
In the meantime South Carolina armed her militia, and prepared for war. But
Congress, which had slighted its suppliant subjects, listened to their
complaints as soon as they were found to have taken up arms. *d A law was
passed, by which the tariff duties were to be progressively reduced for ten
years, until they were brought so low as not to exceed the amount of supplies
necessary to the Government. *e Thus Congress completely abandoned the
principle of the tariff; and substituted a mere fiscal impost to a system of
protective duties. *f The Government of the Union, in order to conceal its
defeat, had recourse to an expedient which is very much in vogue with feeble
governments. It yielded the point de facto, but it remained inflexible upon the
principles in question; and whilst Congress was altering the tariff law, it
passed another bill, by which the President was invested with extraordinary
powers, enabling him to overcome by force a resistance which was then no longer
to be apprehended.
d 
[ Congress was finally decided to take this step by the conduct of the powerful
State of Virginia, whose legislature offered to serve as mediator between the
Union and South Carolina. Hitherto the latter State had appeared to be entirely
abandoned, even by the States which had joined in her remonstrances.]
e 
[ This law was passed on March 2, 1833.]
f 
[ This bill was brought in by Mr. Clay, and it passed in four days through both
Houses of Congress by an immense majority.]
But South Carolina did not consent to leave the Union in the enjoyment of these
scanty trophies of success: the same national Convention which had annulled the
tariff bill, met again, and accepted the proffered concession; but at the same
time it declared its unabated perseverance in the doctrine of Nullification: and
to prove what it said, it annulled the law investing the President with
extraordinary powers, although it was very certain that the clauses of that law
would never be carried into effect.
Almost all the controversies of which I have been speaking have taken place
under the Presidency of General Jackson; and it cannot be denied that in the
question of the tariff he has supported the claims of the Union with vigor and
with skill. I am, however, of opinion that the conduct of the individual who
now represents the Federal Government may be reckoned as one of the dangers
which threaten its continuance.
Some persons in Europe have formed an opinion of the possible influence of
General Jackson upon the affairs of his country, which appears highly
extravagant to those who have seen more of the subject. We have been told that
General Jackson has won sundry battles, that he is an energetic man, prone by
nature and by habit to the use of force, covetous of power, and a despot by
taste. All this may perhaps be true; but the inferences which have been drawn
from these truths are exceedingly erroneous. It has been imagined that General
Jackson is bent on establishing a dictatorship in America, on introducing a
military spirit, and on giving a degree of influence to the central authority
which cannot but be dangerous to provincial liberties. But in America the time
for similar undertakings, and the age for men of this kind, is not yet come: if
General Jackson had entertained a hope of exercising his authority in this
manner, he would infallibly have forfeited his political station, and
compromised his life; accordingly he has not been so imprudent as to make any
such attempt.
Far from wishing to extend the federal power, the President belongs to the
party which is desirous of limiting that power to the bare and precise letter
of the Constitution, and which never puts a construction upon that act
favorable to the Government of the Union; far from standing forth as the
champion of centralization, General Jackson is the agent of all the jealousies
of the States; and he was placed in the lofty station he occupies by the
passions of the people which are most opposed to the central Government. It is
by perpetually flattering these passions that he maintains his station and his
popularity. General Jackson is the slave of the majority: he yields to its
wishes, its propensities, and its demands; say rather, that he anticipates and
forestalls them.
Whenever the governments of the States come into collision with that of the
Union, the President is generally the first to question his own rights: he
almost always outstrips the legislature; and when the extent of the federal
power is controverted, he takes part, as it were, against himself; he conceals
his official interests, and extinguishes his own natural inclinations. Not
indeed that he is naturally weak or hostile to the Union; for when the majority
decided against the claims of the partisans of nullification, he put himself at
its head, asserted the doctrines which the nation held distinctly and
energetically, and was the first to recommend forcible measures; but General
Jackson appears to me, if I may use the American expressions, to be a
Federalist by taste, and a Republican by calculation.
General Jackson stoops to gain the favor of the majority, but when he feels
that his popularity is secure, he overthrows all obstacles in the pursuit of
the objects which the community approves, or of those which it does not look
upon with a jealous eye. He is supported by a power with which his predecessors
were unacquainted; and he tramples on his personal enemies whenever they cross
his path with a facility which no former President ever enjoyed; he takes upon
himself the responsibility of measures which no one before him would have
ventured to attempt: he even treats the national representatives with disdain
approaching to insult; he puts his veto upon the laws of Congress, and
frequently neglects to reply to that powerful body. He is a favorite who
sometimes treats his master roughly. The power of General Jackson perpetually
increases; but that of the President declines; in his hands the Federal
Government is strong, but it will pass enfeebled into the hands of his
successor.
I am strangely mistaken if the Federal Government of the United States be not
constantly losing strength, retiring gradually from public affairs, and
narrowing its circle of action more and more. It is naturally feeble, but it
now abandons even its pretensions to strength. On the other hand, I thought
that I remarked a more lively sense of independence, and a more decided
attachment to provincial government in the States. The Union is to subsist, but
to subsist as a shadow; it is to be strong in certain cases, and weak in all
others; in time of warfare, it is to be able to concentrate all the forces of
the nation and all the resources of the country in its hands; and in time of
peace its existence is to be scarcely perceptible: as if this alternate
debility and vigor were natural or possible.
I do not foresee anything for the present which may be able to check this
general impulse of public opinion; the causes in which it originated do not
cease to operate with the same effect. The change will therefore go on, and it
may be predicted that, unless some extraordinary event occurs, the Government
of the Union will grow weaker and weaker every day.
I think, however, that the period is still remote at which the federal power
will be entirely extinguished by its inability to protect itself and to
maintain peace in the country. The Union is sanctioned by the manners and
desires of the people; its results are palpable, its benefits visible. When it
is perceived that the weakness of the Federal Government compromises the
existence of the Union, I do not doubt that a reaction will take place with a
view to increase its strength.
The Government of the United States is, of all the federal governments which
have hitherto been established, the one which is most naturally destined to
act. As long as it is only indirectly assailed by the interpretation of its
laws, and as long as its substance is not seriously altered, a change of
opinion, an internal crisis, or a war, may restore all the vigor which it
requires. The point which I have been most anxious to put in a clear light is
simply this: Many people, especially in France, imagine that a change in
opinion is going on in the United States, which is favorable to a
centralization of power in the hands of the President and the Congress. I hold
that a contrary tendency may distinctly be observed. So far is the Federal
Government from acquiring strength, and from threatening the sovereignty of the
States, as it grows older, that I maintain it to be growing weaker and weaker,
and that the sovereignty of the Union alone is in danger. Such are the facts
which the present time discloses. The future conceals the final result of this
tendency, and the events which may check, retard, or accelerate the changes I
have described; but I do not affect to be able to remove the veil which hides
them from our sight.
Of The Republican Institutions Of The United States, And What Their Chances Of
Duration Are
The Union is accidental—The Republican institutions have more prospect of
permanence—A republic for the present the natural state of the
Anglo-Americans—Reason of this—In order to destroy it, all the laws
must be changed at the same time, and a great alteration take place in
manners—Difficulties experienced by the Americans in creating an
aristocracy.
The dismemberment of the Union, by the introduction of war into the heart of
those States which are now confederate, with standing armies, a dictatorship,
and a heavy taxation, might, eventually, compromise the fate of the republican
institutions. But we ought not to confound the future prospects of the republic
with those of the Union. The Union is an accident, which will only last as long
as circumstances are favorable to its existence; but a republican form of
government seems to me to be the natural state of the Americans; which nothing
but the continued action of hostile causes, always acting in the same
direction, could change into a monarchy. The Union exists principally in the
law which formed it; one revolution, one change in public opinion, might
destroy it forever; but the republic has a much deeper foundation to rest upon.
What is understood by a republican government in the United States is the slow
and quiet action of society upon itself. It is a regular state of things really
founded upon the enlightened will of the people. It is a conciliatory
government under which resolutions are allowed time to ripen; and in which they
are deliberately discussed, and executed with mature judgment. The republicans
in the United States set a high value upon morality, respect religious belief,
and acknowledge the existence of rights. They profess to think that a people
ought to be moral, religious, and temperate, in proportion as it is free. What
is called the republic in the United States, is the tranquil rule of the
majority, which, after having had time to examine itself, and to give proof of
its existence, is the common source of all the powers of the State. But the
power of the majority is not of itself unlimited. In the moral world humanity,
justice, and reason enjoy an undisputed supremacy; in the political world
vested rights are treated with no less deference. The majority recognizes these
two barriers; and if it now and then overstep them, it is because, like
individuals, it has passions, and, like them, it is prone to do what is wrong,
whilst it discerns what is right.
But the demagogues of Europe have made strange discoveries. A republic is not,
according to them, the rule of the majority, as has hitherto been thought, but
the rule of those who are strenuous partisans of the majority. It is not the
people who preponderates in this kind of government, but those who are best
versed in the good qualities of the people. A happy distinction, which allows
men to act in the name of nations without consulting them, and to claim their
gratitude whilst their rights are spurned. A republican government, moreover,
is the only one which claims the right of doing whatever it chooses, and
despising what men have hitherto respected, from the highest moral obligations
to the vulgar rules of common-sense. It had been supposed, until our time, that
despotism was odious, under whatever form it appeared. But it is a discovery of
modern days that there are such things as legitimate tyranny and holy
injustice, provided they are exercised in the name of the people.
The ideas which the Americans have adopted respecting the republican form of
government, render it easy for them to live under it, and insure its duration.
If, in their country, this form be often practically bad, at least it is
theoretically good; and, in the end, the people always acts in conformity to
it.
It was impossible at the foundation of the States, and it would still be
difficult, to establish a central administration in America. The inhabitants
are dispersed over too great a space, and separated by too many natural
obstacles, for one man to undertake to direct the details of their existence.
America is therefore pre-eminently the country of provincial and municipal
government. To this cause, which was plainly felt by all the Europeans of the
New World, the Anglo-Americans added several others peculiar to themselves.
At the time of the settlement of the North American colonies, municipal liberty
had already penetrated into the laws as well as the manners of the English; and
the emigrants adopted it, not only as a necessary thing, but as a benefit which
they knew how to appreciate. We have already seen the manner in which the
colonies were founded: every province, and almost every district, was peopled
separately by men who were strangers to each other, or who associated with very
different purposes. The English settlers in the United States, therefore, early
perceived that they were divided into a great number of small and distinct
communities which belonged to no common centre; and that it was needful for
each of these little communities to take care of its own affairs, since there
did not appear to be any central authority which was naturally bound and easily
enabled to provide for them. Thus, the nature of the country, the manner in
which the British colonies were founded, the habits of the first emigrants, in
short everything, united to promote, in an extraordinary degree, municipal and
provincial liberties.
In the United States, therefore, the mass of the institutions of the country is
essentially republican; and in order permanently to destroy the laws which form
the basis of the republic, it would be necessary to abolish all the laws at
once. At the present day it would be even more difficult for a party to succeed
in founding a monarchy in the United States than for a set of men to proclaim
that France should henceforward be a republic. Royalty would not find a system
of legislation prepared for it beforehand; and a monarchy would then exist,
really surrounded by republican institutions. The monarchical principle would
likewise have great difficulty in penetrating into the manners of the
Americans.
In the United States, the sovereignty of the people is not an isolated doctrine
bearing no relation to the prevailing manners and ideas of the people: it may,
on the contrary, be regarded as the last link of a chain of opinions which
binds the whole Anglo-American world. That Providence has given to every human
being the degree of reason necessary to direct himself in the affairs which
interest him exclusively—such is the grand maxim upon which civil and
political society rests in the United States. The father of a family applies it
to his children; the master to his servants; the township to its officers; the
province to its townships; the State to its provinces; the Union to the States;
and when extended to the nation, it becomes the doctrine of the sovereignty of
the people.
Thus, in the United States, the fundamental principle of the republic is the
same which governs the greater part of human actions; republican notions
insinuate themselves into all the ideas, opinions, and habits of the Americans,
whilst they are formerly recognized by the legislation: and before this
legislation can be altered the whole community must undergo very serious
changes. In the United States, even the religion of most of the citizens is
republican, since it submits the truths of the other world to private judgment:
as in politics the care of its temporal interests is abandoned to the good
sense of the people. Thus every man is allowed freely to take that road which
he thinks will lead him to heaven; just as the law permits every citizen to
have the right of choosing his government.
It is evident that nothing but a long series of events, all having the same
tendency, can substitute for this combination of laws, opinions, and manners, a
mass of opposite opinions, manners, and laws.
If republican principles are to perish in America, they can only yield after a
laborious social process, often interrupted, and as often resumed; they will
have many apparent revivals, and will not become totally extinct until an
entirely new people shall have succeeded to that which now exists. Now, it must
be admitted that there is no symptom or presage of the approach of such a
revolution. There is nothing more striking to a person newly arrived in the
United States, than the kind of tumultuous agitation in which he finds
political society. The laws are incessantly changing, and at first sight it
seems impossible that a people so variable in its desires should avoid
adopting, within a short space of time, a completely new form of government.
Such apprehensions are, however, premature; the instability which affects
political institutions is of two kinds, which ought not to be confounded: the
first, which modifies secondary laws, is not incompatible with a very settled
state of society; the other shakes the very foundations of the Constitution,
and attacks the fundamental principles of legislation; this species of
instability is always followed by troubles and revolutions, and the nation
which suffers under it is in a state of violent transition.
Experience shows that these two kinds of legislative instability have no
necessary connection; for they have been found united or separate, according to
times and circumstances. The first is common in the United States, but not the
second: the Americans often change their laws, but the foundation of the
Constitution is respected.
In our days the republican principle rules in America, as the monarchical
principle did in France under Louis XIV. The French of that period were not
only friends of the monarchy, but they thought it impossible to put anything in
its place; they received it as we receive the rays of the sun and the return of
the seasons. Amongst them the royal power had neither advocates nor opponents.
In like manner does the republican government exist in America, without
contention or opposition; without proofs and arguments, by a tacit agreement, a
sort of consensus universalis. It is, however, my opinion that by changing
their administrative forms as often as they do, the inhabitants of the United
States compromise the future stability of their government.
It may be apprehended that men, perpetually thwarted in their designs by the
mutability of the legislation, will learn to look upon republican institutions
as an inconvenient form of society; the evil resulting from the instability of
the secondary enactments might then raise a doubt as to the nature of the
fundamental principles of the Constitution, and indirectly bring about a
revolution; but this epoch is still very remote.
It may, however, be foreseen even now, that when the Americans lose their
republican institutions they will speedily arrive at a despotic government,
without a long interval of limited monarchy. Montesquieu remarked, that nothing
is more absolute than the authority of a prince who immediately succeeds a
republic, since the powers which had fearlessly been intrusted to an elected
magistrate are then transferred to a hereditary sovereign. This is true in
general, but it is more peculiarly applicable to a democratic republic. In the
United States, the magistrates are not elected by a particular class of
citizens, but by the majority of the nation; they are the immediate
representatives of the passions of the multitude; and as they are wholly
dependent upon its pleasure, they excite neither hatred nor fear: hence, as I
have already shown, very little care has been taken to limit their influence,
and they are left in possession of a vast deal of arbitrary power. This state
of things has engendered habits which would outlive itself; the American
magistrate would retain his power, but he would cease to be responsible for the
exercise of it; and it is impossible to say what bounds could then be set to
tyranny.
Some of our European politicians expect to see an aristocracy arise in America,
and they already predict the exact period at which it will be able to assume
the reins of government. I have previously observed, and I repeat my assertion,
that the present tendency of American society appears to me to become more and
more democratic. Nevertheless, I do not assert that the Americans will not, at
some future time, restrict the circle of political rights in their country, or
confiscate those rights to the advantage of a single individual; but I cannot
imagine that they will ever bestow the exclusive exercise of them upon a
privileged class of citizens, or, in other words, that they will ever found an
aristocracy.
An aristocratic body is composed of a certain number of citizens who, without
being very far removed from the mass of the people, are, nevertheless,
permanently stationed above it: a body which it is easy to touch and difficult
to strike; with which the people are in daily contact, but with which they can
never combine. Nothing can be imagined more contrary to nature and to the
secret propensities of the human heart than a subjection of this kind; and men
who are left to follow their own bent will always prefer the arbitrary power of
a king to the regular administration of an aristocracy. Aristocratic
institutions cannot subsist without laying down the inequality of men as a
fundamental principle, as a part and parcel of the legislation, affecting the
condition of the human family as much as it affects that of society; but these
are things so repugnant to natural equity that they can only be extorted from
men by constraint.
I do not think a single people can be quoted, since human society began to
exist, which has, by its own free will and by its own exertions, created an
aristocracy within its own bosom. All the aristocracies of the Middle Ages were
founded by military conquest; the conqueror was the noble, the vanquished
became the serf. Inequality was then imposed by force; and after it had been
introduced into the manners of the country it maintained its own authority, and
was sanctioned by the legislation. Communities have existed which were
aristocratic from their earliest origin, owing to circumstances anterior to
that event, and which became more democratic in each succeeding age. Such was
the destiny of the Romans, and of the barbarians after them. But a people,
having taken its rise in civilization and democracy, which should gradually
establish an inequality of conditions, until it arrived at inviolable
privileges and exclusive castes, would be a novelty in the world; and nothing
intimates that America is likely to furnish so singular an example.
Reflection On The Causes Of The Commercial Prosperity Of The Of The United
States
The Americans destined by Nature to be a great maritime people—Extent of
their coasts—Depth of their ports—Size of their rivers—The
commercial superiority of the Anglo-Americans less attributable, however, to
physical circumstances than to moral and intellectual causes—Reason of
this opinion—Future destiny of the Anglo-Americans as a commercial
nation—The dissolution of the Union would not check the maritime vigor of
the States—Reason of this—Anglo-Americans will naturally supply the
wants of the inhabitants of South America—They will become, like the
English, the factors of a great portion of the world.
The coast of the United States, from the Bay of Fundy to the Sabine River in
the Gulf of Mexico, is more than two thousand miles in extent. These shores
form an unbroken line, and they are all subject to the same government. No
nation in the world possesses vaster, deeper, or more secure ports for shipping
than the Americans.
The inhabitants of the United States constitute a great civilized people, which
fortune has placed in the midst of an uncultivated country at a distance of
three thousand miles from the central point of civilization. America
consequently stands in daily need of European trade. The Americans will, no
doubt, ultimately succeed in producing or manufacturing at home most of the
articles which they require; but the two continents can never be independent of
each other, so numerous are the natural ties which exist between their wants,
their ideas, their habits, and their manners.
The Union produces peculiar commodities which are now become necessary to us,
but which cannot be cultivated, or can only be raised at an enormous expense,
upon the soil of Europe. The Americans only consume a small portion of this
produce, and they are willing to sell us the rest. Europe is therefore the
market of America, as America is the market of Europe; and maritime commerce is
no less necessary to enable the inhabitants of the United States to transport
their raw materials to the ports of Europe, than it is to enable us to supply
them with our manufactured produce. The United States were therefore
necessarily reduced to the alternative of increasing the business of other
maritime nations to a great extent, if they had themselves declined to enter
into commerce, as the Spaniards of Mexico have hitherto done; or, in the second
place, of becoming one of the first trading powers of the globe.
The Anglo-Americans have always displayed a very decided taste for the sea. The
Declaration of Independence broke the commercial restrictions which united them
to England, and gave a fresh and powerful stimulus to their maritime genius.
Ever since that time, the shipping of the Union has increased in almost the
same rapid proportion as the number of its inhabitants. The Americans
themselves now transport to their own shores nine-tenths of the European
produce which they consume. *g And they also bring three-quarters of the
exports of the New World to the European consumer. *h The ships of the United
States fill the docks of Havre and of Liverpool; whilst the number of English
and French vessels which are to be seen at New York is comparatively small. *i
g 
[ The total value of goods imported during the year which ended on September
30, 1832, was $101,129,266. The value of the cargoes of foreign vessels did not
amount to $10,731,039, or about one-tenth of the entire sum.]
h 
[ The value of goods exported during the same year amounted to $87,176,943; the
value of goods exported by foreign vessels amounted to $21,036,183, or about
one quarter of the whole sum. (Williams’s “Register,” 1833,
p. 398.)]
i 
[ The tonnage of the vessels which entered all the ports of the Union in the
years 1829, 1830, and 1831, amounted to 3,307,719 tons, of which 544,571 tons
were foreign vessels; they stood, therefore, to the American vessels in a ratio
of about 16 to 100. (“National Calendar,” 1833, p. 304.) The
tonnage of the English vessels which entered the ports of London, Liverpool,
and Hull, in the years 1820, 1826, and 1831, amounted to 443,800 tons. The
foreign vessels which entered the same ports during the same years amounted to
159,431 tons. The ratio between them was, therefore, about 36 to 100.
(“Companion to the Almanac,” 1834, p. 169.) In the year 1832 the
ratio between the foreign and British ships which entered the ports of Great
Britain was 29 to 100. [These statements relate to a condition of affairs which
has ceased to exist; the Civil War and the heavy taxation of the United States
entirely altered the trade and navigation of the country.]]
Thus, not only does the American merchant face the competition of his own
countrymen, but he even supports that of foreign nations in their own ports
with success. This is readily explained by the fact that the vessels of the
United States can cross the seas at a cheaper rate than any other vessels in
the world. As long as the mercantile shipping of the United States preserves
this superiority, it will not only retain what it has acquired, but it will
constantly increase in prosperity.
It is difficult to say for what reason the Americans can trade at a lower rate
than other nations; and one is at first led to attribute this circumstance to
the physical or natural advantages which are within their reach; but this
supposition is erroneous. The American vessels cost almost as much to build as
our own; *j they are not better built, and they generally last for a shorter
time. The pay of the American sailor is more considerable than the pay on board
European ships; which is proved by the great number of Europeans who are to be
met with in the merchant vessels of the United States. But I am of opinion that
the true cause of their superiority must not be sought for in physical
advantages, but that it is wholly attributable to their moral and intellectual
qualities.
j 
[ Materials are, generally speaking, less expensive in America than in Europe,
but the price of labor is much higher.]
The following comparison will illustrate my meaning. During the campaigns of
the Revolution the French introduced a new system of tactics into the art of
war, which perplexed the oldest generals, and very nearly destroyed the most
ancient monarchies in Europe. They undertook (what had never before been
attempted) to make shift without a number of things which had always been held
to be indispensable in warfare; they required novel exertions on the part of
their troops which no civilized nations had ever thought of; they achieved
great actions in an incredibly short space of time; and they risked human life
without hesitation to obtain the object in view. The French had less money and
fewer men than their enemies; their resources were infinitely inferior;
nevertheless they were constantly victorious, until their adversaries chose to
imitate their example.
The Americans have introduced a similar system into their commercial
speculations; and they do for cheapness what the French did for conquest. The
European sailor navigates with prudence; he only sets sail when the weather is
favorable; if an unforseen accident befalls him, he puts into port; at night he
furls a portion of his canvas; and when the whitening billows intimate the
vicinity of land, he checks his way, and takes an observation of the sun. But
the American neglects these precautions and braves these dangers. He weighs
anchor in the midst of tempestuous gales; by night and by day he spreads his
sheets to the wind; he repairs as he goes along such damage as his vessel may
have sustained from the storm; and when he at last approaches the term of his
voyage, he darts onward to the shore as if he already descried a port. The
Americans are often shipwrecked, but no trader crosses the seas so rapidly. And
as they perform the same distance in a shorter time, they can perform it at a
cheaper rate.
The European touches several times at different ports in the course of a long
voyage; he loses a good deal of precious time in making the harbor, or in
waiting for a favorable wind to leave it; and he pays daily dues to be allowed
to remain there. The American starts from Boston to go to purchase tea in
China; he arrives at Canton, stays there a few days, and then returns. In less
than two years he has sailed as far as the entire circumference of the globe,
and he has seen land but once. It is true that during a voyage of eight or ten
months he has drunk brackish water and lived upon salt meat; that he has been
in a continual contest with the sea, with disease, and with a tedious
existence; but upon his return he can sell a pound of his tea for a half-penny
less than the English merchant, and his purpose is accomplished.
I cannot better explain my meaning than by saying that the Americans affect a
sort of heroism in their manner of trading. But the European merchant will
always find it very difficult to imitate his American competitor, who, in
adopting the system which I have just described, follows not only a calculation
of his gain, but an impulse of his nature.
The inhabitants of the United States are subject to all the wants and all the
desires which result from an advanced stage of civilization; but as they are
not surrounded by a community admirably adapted, like that of Europe, to
satisfy their wants, they are often obliged to procure for themselves the
various articles which education and habit have rendered necessaries. In
America it sometimes happens that the same individual tills his field, builds
his dwelling, contrives his tools, makes his shoes, and weaves the coarse stuff
of which his dress is composed. This circumstance is prejudicial to the
excellence of the work; but it powerfully contributes to awaken the
intelligence of the workman. Nothing tends to materialize man, and to deprive
his work of the faintest trace of mind, more than extreme division of labor. In
a country like America, where men devoted to special occupations are rare, a
long apprenticeship cannot be required from anyone who embraces a profession.
The Americans, therefore, change their means of gaining a livelihood very
readily; and they suit their occupations to the exigencies of the moment, in
the manner most profitable to themselves. Men are to be met with who have
successively been barristers, farmers, merchants, ministers of the gospel, and
physicians. If the American be less perfect in each craft than the European, at
least there is scarcely any trade with which he is utterly unacquainted. His
capacity is more general, and the circle of his intelligence is enlarged.
The inhabitants of the United States are never fettered by the axioms of their
profession; they escape from all the prejudices of their present station; they
are not more attached to one line of operation than to another; they are not
more prone to employ an old method than a new one; they have no rooted habits,
and they easily shake off the influence which the habits of other nations might
exercise upon their minds from a conviction that their country is unlike any
other, and that its situation is without a precedent in the world. America is a
land of wonders, in which everything is in constant motion, and every movement
seems an improvement. The idea of novelty is there indissolubly connected with
the idea of amelioration. No natural boundary seems to be set to the efforts of
man; and what is not yet done is only what he has not yet attempted to do.
This perpetual change which goes on in the United States, these frequent
vicissitudes of fortune, accompanied by such unforeseen fluctuations in private
and in public wealth, serve to keep the minds of the citizens in a perpetual
state of feverish agitation, which admirably invigorates their exertions, and
keeps them in a state of excitement above the ordinary level of mankind. The
whole life of an American is passed like a game of chance, a revolutionary
crisis, or a battle. As the same causes are continually in operation throughout
the country, they ultimately impart an irresistible impulse to the national
character. The American, taken as a chance specimen of his countrymen, must
then be a man of singular warmth in his desires, enterprising, fond of
adventure, and, above all, of innovation. The same bent is manifest in all that
he does; he introduces it into his political laws, his religious doctrines, his
theories of social economy, and his domestic occupations; he bears it with him
in the depths of the backwoods, as well as in the business of the city. It is
this same passion, applied to maritime commerce, which makes him the cheapest
and the quickest trader in the world.
As long as the sailors of the United States retain these inspiriting
advantages, and the practical superiority which they derive from them, they
will not only continue to supply the wants of the producers and consumers of
their own country, but they will tend more and more to become, like the
English, the factors of all other peoples. *k This prediction has already begun
to be realized; we perceive that the American traders are introducing
themselves as intermediate agents in the commerce of several European nations;
*l and America will offer a still wider field to their enterprise.

[ It must not be supposed that English vessels are exclusively employed in
transporting foreign produce into England, or British produce to foreign
countries; at the present day the merchant shipping of England may be regarded
in the light of a vast system of public conveyances, ready to serve all the
producers of the world, and to open communications between all peoples. The
maritime genius of the Americans prompts them to enter into competition with
the English.]

[ Part of the commerce of the Mediterranean is already carried on by American
vessels.]
The great colonies which were founded in South America by the Spaniards and the
Portuguese have since become empires. Civil war and oppression now lay waste
those extensive regions. Population does not increase, and the thinly scattered
inhabitants are too much absorbed in the cares of self-defense even to attempt
any amelioration of their condition. Such, however, will not always be the
case. Europe has succeeded by her own efforts in piercing the gloom of the
Middle Ages; South America has the same Christian laws and Christian manners as
we have; she contains all the germs of civilization which have grown amidst the
nations of Europe or their offsets, added to the advantages to be derived from
our example: why then should she always remain uncivilized? It is clear that
the question is simply one of time; at some future period, which may be more or
less remote, the inhabitants of South America will constitute flourishing and
enlightened nations.
But when the Spaniards and Portuguese of South America begin to feel the wants
common to all civilized nations, they will still be unable to satisfy those
wants for themselves; as the youngest children of civilization, they must
perforce admit the superiority of their elder brethren. They will be
agriculturists long before they succeed in manufactures or commerce, and they
will require the mediation of strangers to exchange their produce beyond seas
for those articles for which a demand will begin to be felt.
It is unquestionable that the Americans of the North will one day supply the
wants of the Americans of the South. Nature has placed them in contiguity, and
has furnished the former with every means of knowing and appreciating those
demands, of establishing a permanent connection with those States, and of
gradually filling their markets. The merchants of the United States could only
forfeit these natural advantages if he were very inferior to the merchant of
Europe; to whom he is, on the contrary, superior in several respects. The
Americans of the United States already exercise a very considerable moral
influence upon all the peoples of the New World. They are the source of
intelligence, and all the nations which inhabit the same continent are already
accustomed to consider them as the most enlightened, the most powerful, and the
most wealthy members of the great American family. All eyes are therefore
turned towards the Union; and the States of which that body is composed are the
models which the other communities try to imitate to the best of their power;
it is from the United States that they borrow their political principles and
their laws.
The Americans of the United States stand in precisely the same position with
regard to the peoples of South America as their fathers, the English, occupy
with regard to the Italians, the Spaniards, the Portuguese, and all those
nations of Europe which receive their articles of daily consumption from
England, because they are less advanced in civilization and trade. England is
at this time the natural emporium of almost all the nations which are within
its reach; the American Union will perform the same part in the other
hemisphere; and every community which is founded, or which prospers in the New
World, is founded and prospers to the advantage of the Anglo-Americans.
If the Union were to be dissolved, the commerce of the States which now compose
it would undoubtedly be checked for a time; but this consequence would be less
perceptible than is generally supposed. It is evident that, whatever may
happen, the commercial States will remain united. They are all contiguous to
each other; they have identically the same opinions, interests, and manners;
and they are alone competent to form a very great maritime power. Even if the
South of the Union were to become independent of the North, it would still
require the services of those States. I have already observed that the South is
not a commercial country, and nothing intimates that it is likely to become so.
The Americans of the South of the United States will therefore be obliged, for
a long time to come, to have recourse to strangers to export their produce, and
to supply them with the commodities which are requisite to satisfy their wants.
But the Northern States are undoubtedly able to act as their intermediate
agents cheaper than any other merchants. They will therefore retain that
employment, for cheapness is the sovereign law of commerce. National claims and
national prejudices cannot resist the influence of cheapness. Nothing can be
more virulent than the hatred which exists between the Americans of the United
States and the English. But notwithstanding these inimical feelings, the
Americans derive the greater part of their manufactured commodities from
England, because England supplies them at a cheaper rate than any other nation.
Thus the increasing prosperity of America turns, notwithstanding the grudges of
the Americans, to the advantage of British manufactures.
Reason shows and experience proves that no commercial prosperity can be durable
if it cannot be united, in case of need, to naval force. This truth is as well
understood in the United States as it can be anywhere else: the Americans are
already able to make their flag respected; in a few years they will be able to
make it feared. I am convinced that the dismemberment of the Union would not
have the effect of diminishing the naval power of the Americans, but that it
would powerfully contribute to increase it. At the present time the commercial
States are connected with others which have not the same interests, and which
frequently yield an unwilling consent to the increase of a maritime power by
which they are only indirectly benefited. If, on the contrary, the commercial
States of the Union formed one independent nation, commerce would become the
foremost of their national interests; they would consequently be willing to
make very great sacrifices to protect their shipping, and nothing would prevent
them from pursuing their designs upon this point.
Nations, as well as men, almost always betray the most prominent features of
their future destiny in their earliest years. When I contemplate the ardor with
which the Anglo-Americans prosecute commercial enterprise, the advantages which
befriend them, and the success of their undertakings, I cannot refrain from
believing that they will one day become the first maritime power of the globe.
They are born to rule the seas, as the Romans were to conquer the world.
I have now nearly reached the close of my inquiry; hitherto, in speaking of the
future destiny of the United States, I have endeavored to divide my subject
into distinct portions, in order to study each of them with more attention. My
present object is to embrace the whole from one single point; the remarks I
shall make will be less detailed, but they will be more sure. I shall perceive
each object less distinctly, but I shall descry the principal facts with more
certainty. A traveller who has just left the walls of an immense city, climbs
the neighboring hill; as he goes father off he loses sight of the men whom he
has so recently quitted; their dwellings are confused in a dense mass; he can
no longer distinguish the public squares, and he can scarcely trace out the
great thoroughfares; but his eye has less difficulty in following the
boundaries of the city, and for the first time he sees the shape of the vast
whole. Such is the future destiny of the British race in North America to my
eye; the details of the stupendous picture are overhung with shade, but I
conceive a clear idea of the entire subject.
The territory now occupied or possessed by the United States of America forms
about one-twentieth part of the habitable earth. But extensive as these
confines are, it must not be supposed that the Anglo-American race will always
remain within them; indeed, it has already far overstepped them.
There was once a time at which we also might have created a great French nation
in the American wilds, to counterbalance the influence of the English upon the
destinies of the New World. France formerly possessed a territory in North
America, scarcely less extensive than the whole of Europe. The three greatest
rivers of that continent then flowed within her dominions. The Indian tribes
which dwelt between the mouth of the St. Lawrence and the delta of the
Mississippi were unaccustomed to any other tongue but ours; and all the
European settlements scattered over that immense region recalled the traditions
of our country. Louisbourg, Montmorency, Duquesne, St. Louis, Vincennes, New
Orleans (for such were the names they bore) are words dear to France and
familiar to our ears.
But a concourse of circumstances, which it would be tedious to enumerate, *m
have deprived us of this magnificent inheritance. Wherever the French settlers
were numerically weak and partially established, they have disappeared: those
who remain are collected on a small extent of country, and are now subject to
other laws. The 400,000 French inhabitants of Lower Canada constitute, at the
present time, the remnant of an old nation lost in the midst of a new people. A
foreign population is increasing around them unceasingly and on all sides,
which already penetrates amongst the ancient masters of the country,
predominates in their cities and corrupts their language. This population is
identical with that of the United States; it is therefore with truth that I
asserted that the British race is not confined within the frontiers of the
Union, since it already extends to the northeast.
m 
[ The foremost of these circumstances is, that nations which are accustomed to
free institutions and municipal government are better able than any others to
found prosperous colonies. The habit of thinking and governing for oneself is
indispensable in a new country, where success necessarily depends, in a great
measure, upon the individual exertions of the settlers.]
To the northwest nothing is to be met with but a few insignificant Russian
settlements; but to the southwest, Mexico presents a barrier to the
Anglo-Americans. Thus, the Spaniards and the Anglo-Americans are, properly
speaking, the only two races which divide the possession of the New World. The
limits of separation between them have been settled by a treaty; but although
the conditions of that treaty are exceedingly favorable to the Anglo-Americans,
I do not doubt that they will shortly infringe this arrangement. Vast
provinces, extending beyond the frontiers of the Union towards Mexico, are
still destitute of inhabitants. The natives of the United States will forestall
the rightful occupants of these solitary regions. They will take possession of
the soil, and establish social institutions, so that when the legal owner
arrives at length, he will find the wilderness under cultivation, and strangers
quietly settled in the midst of his inheritance. *n
n 
[ [This was speedily accomplished, and ere long both Texas and California
formed part of the United States. The Russian settlements were acquired by
purchase.]]
The lands of the New World belong to the first occupant, and they are the
natural reward of the swiftest pioneer. Even the countries which are already
peopled will have some difficulty in securing themselves from this invasion. I
have already alluded to what is taking place in the province of Texas. The
inhabitants of the United States are perpetually migrating to Texas, where they
purchase land; and although they conform to the laws of the country, they are
gradually founding the empire of their own language and their own manners. The
province of Texas is still part of the Mexican dominions, but it will soon
contain no Mexicans; the same thing has occurred whenever the Anglo-Americans
have come into contact with populations of a different origin.
It cannot be denied that the British race has acquired an amazing preponderance
over all the other European races in the New World; and that it is very
superior to them in civilization, in industry, and in power. As long as it is
only surrounded by desert or thinly peopled countries, as long as it encounters
no dense populations upon its route, through which it cannot work its way, it
will assuredly continue to spread. The lines marked out by treaties will not
stop it; but it will everywhere transgress these imaginary barriers.
The geographical position of the British race in the New World is peculiarly
favorable to its rapid increase. Above its northern frontiers the icy regions
of the Pole extend; and a few degrees below its southern confines lies the
burning climate of the Equator. The Anglo-Americans are, therefore, placed in
the most temperate and habitable zone of the continent.
It is generally supposed that the prodigious increase of population in the
United States is posterior to their Declaration of Independence. But this is an
error: the population increased as rapidly under the colonial system as it does
at the present day; that is to say, it doubled in about twenty-two years. But
this proportion which is now applied to millions, was then applied to thousands
of inhabitants; and the same fact which was scarcely noticeable a century ago,
is now evident to every observer.
The British subjects in Canada, who are dependent on a king, augment and spread
almost as rapidly as the British settlers of the United States, who live under
a republican government. During the war of independence, which lasted eight
years, the population continued to increase without intermission in the same
ratio. Although powerful Indian nations allied with the English existed at that
time upon the western frontiers, the emigration westward was never checked.
Whilst the enemy laid waste the shores of the Atlantic, Kentucky, the western
parts of Pennsylvania, and the States of Vermont and of Maine were filling with
inhabitants. Nor did the unsettled state of the Constitution, which succeeded
the war, prevent the increase of the population, or stop its progress across
the wilds. Thus, the difference of laws, the various conditions of peace and
war, of order and of anarchy, have exercised no perceptible influence upon the
gradual development of the Anglo-Americans. This may be readily understood; for
the fact is, that no causes are sufficiently general to exercise a simultaneous
influence over the whole of so extensive a territory. One portion of the
country always offers a sure retreat from the calamities which afflict another
part; and however great may be the evil, the remedy which is at hand is greater
still.
It must not, then, be imagined that the impulse of the British race in the New
World can be arrested. The dismemberment of the Union, and the hostilities
which might ensure, the abolition of republican institutions, and the
tyrannical government which might succeed it, may retard this impulse, but they
cannot prevent it from ultimately fulfilling the destinies to which that race
is reserved. No power upon earth can close upon the emigrants that fertile
wilderness which offers resources to all industry, and a refuge from all want.
Future events, of whatever nature they may be, will not deprive the Americans
of their climate or of their inland seas, of their great rivers or of their
exuberant soil. Nor will bad laws, revolutions, and anarchy be able to
obliterate that love of prosperity and that spirit of enterprise which seem to
be the distinctive characteristics of their race, or to extinguish that
knowledge which guides them on their way.
Thus, in the midst of the uncertain future, one event at least is sure. At a
period which may be said to be near (for we are speaking of the life of a
nation), the Anglo-Americans will alone cover the immense space contained
between the polar regions and the tropics, extending from the coasts of the
Atlantic to the shores of the Pacific Ocean. The territory which will probably
be occupied by the Anglo-Americans at some future time, may be computed to
equal three-quarters of Europe in extent. *o The climate of the Union is upon
the whole preferable to that of Europe, and its natural advantages are not less
great; it is therefore evident that its population will at some future time be
proportionate to our own. Europe, divided as it is between so many different
nations, and torn as it has been by incessant wars and the barbarous manners of
the Middle Ages, has notwithstanding attained a population of 410 inhabitants
to the square league. *p What cause can prevent the United States from having
as numerous a population in time?
o 
[ The United States already extend over a territory equal to one-half of
Europe. The area of Europe is 500,000 square leagues, and its population
205,000,000 of inhabitants. (“Malte Brun,” liv. 114. vol. vi. p.
4.)
[This computation is given in French leagues, which were in use when the author
wrote. Twenty years later, in 1850, the superficial area of the United States
had been extended to 3,306,865 square miles of territory, which is about the
area of Europe.]]
p 
[ See “Malte Brun,” liv. 116, vol. vi. p. 92.]
Many ages must elapse before the divers offsets of the British race in America
cease to present the same homogeneous characteristics: and the time cannot be
foreseen at which a permanent inequality of conditions will be established in
the New World. Whatever differences may arise, from peace or from war, from
freedom or oppression, from prosperity or want, between the destinies of the
different descendants of the great Anglo-American family, they will at least
preserve an analogous social condition, and they will hold in common the
customs and the opinions to which that social condition has given birth.
In the Middle Ages, the tie of religion was sufficiently powerful to imbue all
the different populations of Europe with the same civilization. The British of
the New World have a thousand other reciprocal ties; and they live at a time
when the tendency to equality is general amongst mankind. The Middle Ages were
a period when everything was broken up; when each people, each province, each
city, and each family, had a strong tendency to maintain its distinct
individuality. At the present time an opposite tendency seems to prevail, and
the nations seem to be advancing to unity. Our means of intellectual
intercourse unite the most remote parts of the earth; and it is impossible for
men to remain strangers to each other, or to be ignorant of the events which
are taking place in any corner of the globe. The consequence is that there is
less difference, at the present day, between the Europeans and their
descendants in the New World, than there was between certain towns in the
thirteenth century which were only separated by a river. If this tendency to
assimilation brings foreign nations closer to each other, it must a fortiori
prevent the descendants of the same people from becoming aliens to each other.
The time will therefore come when one hundred and fifty millions of men will be
living in North America, *q equal in condition, the progeny of one race, owing
their origin to the same cause, and preserving the same civilization, the same
language, the same religion, the same habits, the same manners, and imbued with
the same opinions, propagated under the same forms. The rest is uncertain, but
this is certain; and it is a fact new to the world—a fact fraught with
such portentous consequences as to baffle the efforts even of the imagination.
q 
[ This would be a population proportionate to that of Europe, taken at a mean
rate of 410 inhabitants to the square league.]
There are, at the present time, two great nations in the world which seem to
tend towards the same end, although they started from different points: I
allude to the Russians and the Americans. Both of them have grown up unnoticed;
and whilst the attention of mankind was directed elsewhere, they have suddenly
assumed a most prominent place amongst the nations; and the world learned their
existence and their greatness at almost the same time.
All other nations seem to have nearly reached their natural limits, and only to
be charged with the maintenance of their power; but these are still in the act
of growth; *r all the others are stopped, or continue to advance with extreme
difficulty; these are proceeding with ease and with celerity along a path to
which the human eye can assign no term. The American struggles against the
natural obstacles which oppose him; the adversaries of the Russian are men; the
former combats the wilderness and savage life; the latter, civilization with
all its weapons and its arts: the conquests of the one are therefore gained by
the ploughshare; those of the other by the sword. The Anglo-American relies
upon personal interest to accomplish his ends, and gives free scope to the
unguided exertions and common-sense of the citizens; the Russian centres all
the authority of society in a single arm: the principal instrument of the
former is freedom; of the latter servitude. Their starting-point is different,
and their courses are not the same; yet each of them seems to be marked out by
the will of Heaven to sway the destinies of half the globe.

rapidly in proportion.]

Today, we’ll talk about working with text data.

So far:
Fixed number of features
Contiguous
Categorical
–
Next up:
No pre-defined features
Free text
Images
(Audio, video, graphs, …: not this class)
So far we talked about data where we have a fixed number of
features, and where the features are either continuous or
categorical. And that is most of the data out there and the
simplest kind of data to work with.
The rest of the semester, we’re going to talk about
different kinds of data that is opposite to what we already
worked with.
We’ll look at data that has no predefined features. In
particular, we’re going to look at free text and images.
We’re also going to look at time series, which is a similar
category of not having a clear way to express it as a
standard supervised learning task. Another common example in
this category is audio and video, we’re not going to do any
audio or video in this lecture. But I think text and images
are the common types of data.
Need to create fixed-length description
.center[

Here’s an example of some text dataset that I’m going to use
later. This is like relatively typical text, its user input
data from IMDb movie reviews.
Clearly, they don’t have the same length, there’s no clear
way to express this is as like some floating point features
which we would use for a standard machine learning approach.
You can also see there are weird things about
capitalization, some weird words in there like Godzilla that
you might not see very often, there is some HTML markup,
there’s punctuation and so on. This is sort of how text
looks like in the wild very often. You could also do things
on much longer texts, like whole books, or articles or so
on.
People also work on text that’s much shorter. Tweets are
still sort of their own domain. Working on tweets is quite
hard because they are very short.
I’m going to talk about a particular kind of data that you
see very often because it’s often used. But there are other
kinds of data that is text data.
.center[

]
Here is a table of the text data consisting of people
sitting in the European Parliament. Each person has a
country, a name, an ID, a party, and a political
affiliation. The variable country here, you might hope that
it’s categorical but for the European Union, actually, the
categories are well known. Though, if you have a user input
a country, they will never input the same country in the
same way. The UK could be the United Kingdom, or England, or
Britain, or Great Britain, and all of these might correspond
in this context to the same entity.
If you have users input this, they will also make typos.
This variable is representing a category concept but you
have to do some cleaning before you can actually convert it
into a category. This is often a manual thing to do. There
are things that can help you with this, like duplication or
an entity recognition but we’re not going to talk about
that.
The names are strings. They are definitely not categorical,
and they’re also not words. So it’s not really clear if
there’s like any information in the name and we’re going to
look into this later today.
But you clearly don’t want to treat them the same way as
words that you find in a dictionary.
We have the political groups and affiliations. Again, these
are sort of free texts. They’re sort of similar to the
variable country only now there’s many more of them, in a
sense, they try to encode a categorical variable, which
political group you’re from, but they also have more
information, for example, you could also treat them as texts
like if there’s freedom or democracy or Christianity or
something in the party title that will probably say
something. So you could either treat it as categorical or as
text and both will give you information. And you have the
same problem, that the same group can be referred with
different names or different spellings.
So there’s this whole area of named entity recognition that
actually tries to extract from any text the named entities
and then tries to disambiguate. We’re actually going to talk
about this, but it’s also some particular kind of text data
that I want you to be aware of.
.center[
]
The most common approach that people use for this is bag of
words, which is a very simple approach.
We start with a string which would be your whole document.
The first step is to tokenize it, which is basically
breaking it up the document into words. And then, you built
a vocabulary over all documents over all words.
So you look over all the movie reviews, or all the emails or
the text you have, and you collect all the tokens which are
representing the words.
Finally, using the vocabulary, you create a group
representation. The length of your feature vector will be
the size of the vocabulary. For each word in the vocabulary,
you count how often this word appears in the string that you
want to encode.
Most of the words in the English language don’t appear in a
sentence. So most of these entries will be 0. But the word
‘ants’ appears once, so increment the count for ‘ants’ by 1
and so on.
So I’ll have 6 non-zero entries and all the other entries
will be 0. So this is what we call like a very sparse vector
so most entries of this vector are 0.
When coding this, we’ll use a sparse matrix encoding. The
idea of sparse matrix encoding is that you only store the
non-zero entries.
So basically, we will only store the 1s, so storing the
string as a bag of word will cost us a nearly 6 floating
point numbers.
.smaller[
]
Here, I have a corpus. Corpus is what people in NLP called
datasets. My dataset is 2 strings, “Do you want ants?”,
“Because that’s how you get ants.”
The bag of word representation is implemented in the count
vectorizer in scikit-learn, which is a
sklearn.feature_extraction.text
This is a transformer, it’s kind of similar to most
transformers. The only difference is it takes in lists of
strings as input, not numeric data. Usually, transformers
take in a Numpy area as anything in scikit-learn.
But here, count vectorizer takes in a list of strings. I
gave the list of string and I fit it on my documents and
this builds the vocabulary. I can get back to vocabulary by
looking at the feature names using get_feature_names()
The vocabulary is sorted alphabetically. Vocabulary has 8
entries from ‘ants’ to ‘you’. So if I use this count
vectorizer to create like a word representation, then I’ll
get an 8-dimensional feature space.
I can use this to transform the 2 documents that I have. X
here, being the outcome of the transform will be a sparse
matrix. So to print it, I call toarray() on it. So sparse
matrices are in scipy, and you can easily convert to and
from numpy arrays.
Usually, it’s a very bad idea to convert to sparse matrix
into Numpy array, since usually, it will not fit into your
memory. If you have like a vocabulary of size 100,000 and
100,000 documents, and you make it into Numpy array, then
your memory will just fill up and your computer will crash
since you won’t have enough memory to store all the zeros.
In this toy example, we can easily convert this to a Numpy
array and you can see that this is the feature
representation. In this case, we only have 1s and 0s.
Each word appears either once or zero times. So here, in the
first string, the first feature is ‘ant’, so ‘ant’, ‘do’,
‘want’ and ‘you ’ appears once, ‘because’, ‘get’, ‘how’, and
‘that’ doesn’t appear. The second string is processed in the
same way.
Q: What would you do if your document has more unique tokens
or tokens that are not in the vocabulary?
Usually, you either ignore them, that’s the default thing to
do. Your test set will have tokens that your training set
will not have, and so you can’t really learn anything about
that. One thing you could do is count how many words out of
the vocabulary there are.
We going to talk a little bit later about how to restrict
your vocabulary and you can basically add a new feature,
that says, “There’s X amount of features that are not in the
vocabulary.” Often, this can be useful for people cascading
something or miss typing something or using names or
something like that.
But usually, you assume that most of the words appear in
your training data set.
Q: What if there are spelling errors?
You can treat them but by default, if you do that, they’re
just different features. So they’re completely unrelated. So
if there’s a new spelling error in your test dataset that
never appeared in your training dataset, then the word will
be completely ignored.
You can use spell correction, I’ll talk about that in a bit.
If you don’t do any spell correction, it will be a
completely distinct feature. Spell correction is also not
entirely trivial because there are many possible words.
Q: Does the count vectorizer trim the apostrophe in ‘that’s’
in the second string?
Yes, and as you can see, the question marks and the dots
also don’t appear. And we’re going to talk about how exactly
it works in a little bit.
Consider two documents in a dataset “malory”
The reason why this is called a bag of words is since you’re
completely ignoring the order of words. So you can do
inverse transform to get back the string representation from
the numerical representation but if you do that the
numerical representation doesn’t contain the order of the
words so you will only get back ‘ants’ ‘do’ ‘want’ ‘you’ and
‘ants’ ‘because’ ‘get’ ‘how’ ‘that’ ‘you’
Basically, you store all the words in a big bag and
completely lose any context and any order of the words.
That’s why it’s called a bag of words.
We’re going to do a binary classification task on a dataset
of IMDb movie reviews. You can look on GitHub, I have the
notebook that runs through all of this if you want to run it
yourself.
The idea here is that we want to do sentiment analysis
basically classifying reviews into either being positive or
negative. In IMDb, they give stars from 0 to 10. This is
from a research paper where the author stated 1, 2 and 3 as
negative while 7, 8, 9 and 10 are positive.
Text data is in either it’s in a CSV format or if they’re
longer documents, people in NLP like to have a single text
file for each data point.
There’s a tool in scikit-learn that allows you to load data,
method load_files function, which basically iterates over
all the folders in a given folder. Each folder is supposed
to correspond to a class and then inside each folder, each
text document corresponds to a data point, that’s a very
common format that people use for text data.
We can load this, then we get the actual data and the
targets.
Text_trainval is used as a training and validation set is
just a list. The length is 25,000. So there are 25,000
documents, and this is a balanced dataset meaning there are
12,500 positive and negative samples.
.smaller[
]
We can also look at data points. I’m calling decode here to
print the Unicode characters.
The word ‘cliché’ can be typed with or without the axon and
they would be two different words. But also, you need to
determine if it’s a Unicode character or not. In Python 3,
by default, everything is a unique code.
I removed all the irrelevant HTML formatting. And then I
split it into training and test set. Then I called the count
vectorizer. Then I fitted the training set and transform the
validation set.
Then it returns a 18750x66651 sparse matrix meaning there
are 18,750 samples and 66,651 features.
So the vocabulary that we built is 66,651. There’s 2.5
million stored elements (non-zero entries).
This is a much, much smaller number than the product of
these two numbers. So most of the entries are zero.
Remember, you need to know whether you are in Python 2 or 3
and then you need to know the type of text.
There are two different things that you need to keep in
mind. So the text can be a byte string or Unicode string.
But if it’s a byte string, it also has an encoding attached
with it. You need to know the encoding to go from the byte
string to the string.

This is the first thing I do, it’s helpful to see if
something sensible happened. And you get an idea of the
data. I’m going to plot the first 10 data points, and I’m
going to plot some 20 in the middle and I’m going to plot
every 2000th data point.
The first couple of ones seem to be pretty boring. But then
it seems to do something relatively reasonable.
Now that we have the sparse matrix representation, we can
just do classification as usual.
All the models in scikit-learn work directly on the sparse
matrix representation. Here, I do logistic regression CV so
it adjusts CR automatically for me. The validation set score
I get is 88% accuracy, which is pretty good.
Here, accuracy is meaningful because we know it’s a balanced
dataset. The next thing I always like to do is look at the
coefficients.
.center[

]
So here I’m looking at the 20 most negative and 20 most
positive coefficients of this logistic regression. It’s
pretty easy to do because it’s a binary task. If you have
multiclass tasks, you’ll have way more coefficients and it’s
harder to visualize.
This seems to be like a pretty reasonable model to pick up
on the bad words and the good words. This is the baseline
approach.
How to tokenize?
How to normalize words?
What to include in vocabulary?
In tokenization, there are many different options to change
what’s happening here.
In particular, there’s the tokenization, which is how do you
break it up into tokens. Then normalization, which is how do
you make tokens look sort of reasonable. And then what to
include in vocabulary.
Scikit-learn (very simplistic):
re.findall(r"\b\w\w+\b")
Includes numbers
discards single-letter words
- or ' break up words
Scikit-learn is not an LLP library. Some very good Python
LLP libraries are NLTK and spacy. They have a lot more
things for doing text analysis. Scikit-learn only has quite
simple things.
In tokenization, what the count vectorizer does the regular
expression, “\b\w\w+\b”. That means it finds anything of
length 2 or longer that has word boundaries, which are any
punctuation or white spaces, and matches w.
As we saw, this includes any numbers. Numbers can be at the
beginning of the word, the middle of the word or it can be
just all numbers.
You don’t include single letter work or single letter
numbers. So ‘I’ is always discarded. There’s an interesting
thing where you can get the gender of a person, depending on
how much often they use ‘I’.
It doesn’t include any punctuation because we only use the
w, which is digits.
This is pretty simple and pretty restrictive.
–
If we just want to use a different regular expression, we
can do something simple, like changing the regular
expression. So here, for example, I removed one of the Ws
and so now I match everything that’s a single letter or
more. So now I only the ‘s’ in ‘that’s’, without the
apostrophe, making it a single token.
I can also allow things to have an apostrophe in the middle
of the word, and get ‘that’s’ as a single token. This might
look nicer but actually, in reality, it usually doesn’t
matter that much.
But you can play around with this and see if the tokens you
get with standard tokenization are good for your
application.
Again, spacy and NLTK have much more sophisticated things.
The X in vectorization slide represents the sparse matrix
representation of the data and Y represents if it’s a
positive or a negative review.
Was not actually an apostroph but some unicode pattern
because I copy & pasted the quote.

“Our meeting today was worse than yesterday,
I’m scared of meeting the clients tomorrow.”
Stemming:

Lemmatization:
.smaller[
scikit-learn:
Lower-case it
Configurable, use nltk or spacy
]
Normalization is basically how do you want to bring your
token in a standardized form. For example, you could get rid
of plurals or you could correct spelling. There are three
main methods.
Correct spelling, which only very few people use in
practice.
Stemming reduces words to their word stem. The idea is to
get rid of plural ‘s’ and ‘ing’ at the end of the verbs and
so on so that you don’t have the conjugations. Stemming
removes some letters at the end of the word depending on a
fixed rule set.
Lemmatization also uses reduces the word stem but in a smart
way. It tries to parse the sentence and then uses a
dictionary of all English words with all its verb forms and
conjugations and tries to map it to a standardized form.
The reason why I picked this example is ‘meeting’ appears
twice in here, once as a noun and once as a verb. Using
stemming:
‘was’ becomes ‘wa’
‘worse’ becomes ‘wors’ and so on
‘I’m’ is just split up in two without the apostrophe.
‘scared’ becomes ‘scare’
‘meeting’ becomes ‘meet’
Lemmatization parsed the sentence and figured out that the
first ‘meeting’ is a noun and keeps it as it is but the
second ‘meeting’ which is a verb is simplified to ‘meet’.
You can also see that the ‘was’ was normalized to ‘be’ and
the ‘worse’ was normalized to ‘bad’ and the ’m was
normalized to ‘be’ as well.
The question with any kind of normalization you do is will
this be helpful for your application.
Q: is stemming only applicable to English literature?
These are both language dependent. This model exists for
many languages. Today, I’m only talking about languages that
work similar to English.
Scikit-learn only lowercases it. You can plug in other
normalization from NLTK or spacy into the count vectorizer
if you want, but the default is it lower cases the tokens.
The other main thing that you can play with is restricting
the vocabulary. So far, I said, we’re just going to use all
the tokens that we see.
.tiny-code[
]
One way to restrict the vocabulary often is to remove stop
words. Stop words, are words that are not so important to
the content and so you discard them.
If I do this for my example, the only thing that remains are
‘ants’ and ‘want’ because ‘this’, ‘I’ and ‘how’ are all stop
words.
Scikit-learn has some stop words built in. So if you do stop
word equal to English, it will use the built-in the stop
word list. It’s a little bit strange and we’re working on
improving it. So for example, there’s ‘system’ in the stop
word list and ‘bill’ is in the stop word list.
For unsupervised problems, using stop words might be
helpful. For supervised problems, I rarely found it helpful
with the tools that we talked about.
So problem is, these are nearly 200 words but we have 66,000
features, removing 200 features doesn’t really make a
difference. And because these words appear very often, the
model won’t be able to figure out are they important or not.
If you use an unsupervised model, in the unsupervised model
since they appear so often, these might just dominate
whatever clustering you do and so removing them might be a
good idea.
not a very good stop-word list? Why is system in it? bill?
For supervised learning often little effect on large corpuses (on small corpuses and for unsupervised learning it can help)
Remove words that appear in less than 2 documents:
.smaller[
]
Restrict vocabulary size to max_features most frequent words:
.smaller[
]
Another thing that is often helpful is removing infrequent
words. There’s a parameter called min_df that basically
removes words that appear less than twice.
It’ll only keep words that appeared twice or more, and so
only ‘ants’ and ‘you’ remain in the toy dataset example.
This is often useful because it can remove a lot of
features. And if a word appears only once in your data, it’s
unlikely that your algorithm will be able to learn. If you
have hundreds of thousands of thousands of features, and one
feature appears once in your dataset, then it’s probably not
going to be helpful.
You can also go the other way around and set max_features.
Max_features sets the number of features that you want to
keep, in this case, four most common features.
It’s kind of interesting, this goes a little bit in the
opposite direction of what the stop words do. The stop words
remove the most common ones that are meaningless and here,
we removed the most infrequent ones because they’re probably
not helpful. These are often misspellings, or names or
something like that.
.smaller[
]
Here I used the count vectorizer with min_df=2 and min_df=4.
That means either use tokens that appear in 2 documents in a
training set, or at least 4 documents in a training set.
Min_df=2 gives me 39825 while min_df=4 gives me 26928. I’ve
drastically reduced the feature space when using min_df=2
and if I set min_df=4, I cut down feature space even more.
Min_df means minimum document frequency, meaning the number
of documents the words appear in. It’s not the number of
times the word appears. So if a word appears in 100 times in
a single document, it’s still going to be thrown out by
this.
Here, I used X_train_df=4, which is much, much smaller, it’s
less than half the size. And the result I get is identical,
basically, in terms of accuracy.
These are the main configuration you just used a single bag
of words.
That said, they’re throwing away a lot of the context and
information. One way to improve upon this is what’s called
N-grams.
Removed nearly 1/3 of features!
As good as before
𝑛𝑑nd = total number of documents
𝑑𝑓(𝑑,𝑡)df(d,t) = number of documents containing term 𝑡t
–
In sklearn: by default also L2 normalisation!
Next thing we can do is actually try to rescale our words
with something called Tf-idf which stands for Term Frequency
Inverse Document Frequency.
This is sort of an alternative to using soft stop words in a
sentence. The idea here is to down-weight things that are
very common.
It’s the logarithm of 1 over the number of documents
containing the term.
So if something happens to appear in most of the documents,
the inverse document frequency will give it a very low
weight. This is something that’s very commonly used in
information retrieval.
Information retrieval basically means you’re trying to find
relevant documents. If you can think of how a search engine
works, if you want to match a bag of words representation of
two different query strings, you might not care so much
about matching the ‘a’ and ‘the’, but you care a lot about
matching the parts that are rare and that are very specific
to a particular search term. That is the motivation for
this.
But people find it also sometimes helps in a machine
learning context.
You can’t really know in advance whether this helps for the
particular dataset or not, but basically you should keep in
mind, this emphasizes rare words and does a soft removal of
very common words. This also means the sort of stop words
here are corpus specific so here it will learn to
down-weight ‘movie’ and ‘film’ because they’re very common.
The implementation of this in scikit-learn is a little bit
non-standard but I don’t think it makes a big difference.
You should also keep in mind is that if you use the
implementation of TF-IDF in scikit-learn by default, it will
also do L2 normalization. L2 normalization means you divide
each row by its length. That means you normalize the weight
the length of the document. You only want to count how often
the word appears relative to how long the document is.
Basically, if you make a document that basically repeats
each word twice, it should still have the same
representation. By default, that’s turned on for TF-IDF. But
it’s not turned on for the bag of words.
Emphasizes “rare” words - “soft stop word removal”
Slightly non-standard smoothing (many +1s)
.smaller[
]
In scikit-learn, there are two ways to do this. You can
either use the TF-IDF vectorizer which you can use directly
on the text and it will build the vocabulary and then do the
rescaling. Or you can use to count vectorizer,
TFIDFTransformer, which will work on the sparse matrix
created by the count vectorizer and then just transform it
using rescaling.
This is an alternative to using stop words or putting more
emphasis on rare words.
Q: Explain the part about the L2 norm.
For the L1 norm, it might be easier to visualize. Dividing
by L1 norm would mean just dividing by word count and so
that would mean that basically, if you have a very long
review, and it says bad 3 times, but it says good 20 times,
then you only care about the relative frequency. And if it’s
a very short review that says good, 0 times, and bad also 3
times, then it’s probably a bad review. So you want to
really scale these so that the relative frequency of the
word only matters and not the total length document. That’s
sort of what the normalization does.
And so the common thing to do is L2 normalization, which
divides by Euclidean norm.
Bag of words completely removes word order.
“didn’t love” and “love” are very different!
–
.center[

]
Because there’s a big difference between ‘didn’t love’ and
‘love’ and the default settings in the count vectorizer
cannot distinguish between the two because somewhere along
the document, it could appear ‘don’t’ and you don’t know if
it’s in front of ‘love’, or if it’s ‘love, don’t hate’ or
‘don’t love hate’, since they basically have the same
representation.
The idea behind N-grams is you look at pairs of words that
appear next to each other. Unigrams looks at single words,
bigrams look at pairs of two words next to each other, and
trigrams looks at three words next to each other, and so on.
Here instead of splitting it up into single tokens, we can
split it up into pairs of tokens allowing me to have a
little bit of context around each of the words.
N-grams: tuples of consecutive words
.tiny-code[
]
When implementing in scikit-learn, you have to specify the
N-gram range, which has the minimum number of tokens and the
maximum number of tokens you want to look at.
Usually, you want to look at Unigram + Bigrams + Trigrams,
don’t look at only Bigrams. If I only look at Unigrams, I
get a vocabulary of size 8. If I look only at Bigrams, I get
a vocabulary of size 8 as well, that’s because this was a
toy example and in the real world there will be much more
Bigrams than Unigrams.
If you look at the result from combining Unigrams and
Bigrams together, we get 16, which is a combination of both
the result.
Now I have a feature representation of size 16, and so I
extended my feature space so that I can take the context
into account.
Unigrams and Bigrams together are the most common
combinations. Using higher order N-grams is rare.
Typically: higher n-grams lead to blow up of feature space!
More than 20x more 4-grams!
This is using no stop words.
Now because many bigrams and many trigrams are very
infrequent. So if I use the example of min_df=4 in Unigrams
I get 26928 features while in Bigrams I get 128426 features.
So it grew by nearly the order of magnitude. So I have a
much, much bigger feature space now. If I put it together,
it’s even bigger.
The higher I go, the bigger it gets. Though, you can see
that it actually grows relatively slowly here. So if I look
into 1-3grams programs, and 1-4grams, I only get 300,000
features. But this is mostly because I did the min_df=4.
There are very few sequences of 4 words that appear often
together. If I don’t use the min_df=4 and I look at all
things I get nearly 8 million features. This is like 20
times more four grams than what we had before.
So particularly if you use higher N-grams using this pruning
of document frequency might be quite helpful. You can see
that probably they have about the same amount of
information, but you’ll have 20 times fewer features, which
will definitely impact runtime and possibly impact
generalization.
#Stop-word impact on bi-grams
This is with stop words. What we’re doing is we do stop
words first and then N-grams. What I find interesting is
that here using unigrams and bigrams we got 155354, but if
we remove the stop words it gets halved to 81085. This is
pretty extreme.
The stop word list is only 200 words. So if we remove these
200 words and if you look at the bigrams we half the number
of bigrams. This is because the most common combinations are
actually we with stop words. So ‘the movie’ and ‘the film’
are probably the most common Bigrams in this.
So if we remove this then whatever word that came before
‘the’ is now makes after bigram. And so now, the
combinations appear much less frequently.

Basically, removing stop words is fine but you should keep
in the ‘not’ and the ‘well’ so that the important things can
still be expressed.
The next thing I want to talk about is character n-grams.
Character n-grams are a different way to extract features
from text data. It’s not that useful for general text
classification but it’s useful for some more specific
applications.
The idea is that, instead of looking at tokens, which are
words, we look at windows of characters.

Here, I want to look at character trigrams, look at windows
of length 3.
My first one would be “Do_” and then “o_y” and then “_you”
and so…
Then you build the vocabulary over these trigrams.
#Applications
Be robust to misspelling / obfuscation
Language detection
Learn from Names / made-up words
This can be helpful to be more robust towards misspelling or
obfuscation. So people might replace a single particular
letter in a word with like internet speak. And so if you use
character n-grams, you can still match if someone used the
same characters for the rest of the word.
You can also use it for language detection. Language
detection, I think by now relatively soft task. But
basically, it’s very easy to detect the language, if you
have a text, you can use character n-grams. You can’t really
use a bag of words because the words in different languages
are sort of distinct, and you don’t actually need to build
vocabularies for all the languages. If you just look at the
n-grams, that’s enough to know whether something is English
or French or something.
Also, it helps to learn from names or any made-up words.
One thing that is interesting in a social context is to look
at ethnicity from names. And you can actually get someone’s
ethnicity from their last name, and in some cases, also from
their first name.
“Naive”
.tiny-code[
]
Respect word boundaries
.tiny-code[
]
To do this with scikit-learn, you can use the count
vectorizer with the analyzer equal char. So instead of word
tokenization, it does character tokenization.
Usually, we look at characters that are longer, so single
characters don’t really tell us much. Here, I look at
n-grams of size 2 and 3. You can also go up to, like 5 or 7,
obviously, the feature space tends to explode if you go
higher.
After applying, I get a vocabulary of size 73, which is
pretty big for such a short text.
And there’s also a featurette that can respect word
boundaries called char_wb.
So here, you get the end of one word and the beginning of
the next word, you might want to exclude that if you’re only
interested on the actual words. So the char_wb makes sure
that there’s no white space inside the character n-gram.
.smaller[
]
If you want, you can use that for classification.
Here, I use it again on the IMDb data set with 2-5grams. The
vocabulary is quite a bit bigger than if I looked at single
words. But actually, I get a result that is about as good as
the bag of words.
.center[

]
I can also look at the features that are important. The way
this looks like is that it seems pretty redundant. So it
picked up different subparts of the words. So this might not
be ideal, but the accuracy is still good.
Another thing that I found quite interesting when I looked
at this is that some people gave their star rating in the
comment. This is actually leaking the label of the star
rating. This is not something that we saw before but here
looking at his character n-grams, we can see that that’s
something that’s in the dataset.
A more useful application is going back to the European
Parliament. What I’m going to do now is predict nationality
from the name.
.center[

Here’s the distribution of the country. This is a very
imbalanced classification.
.tiny-code[
]
I can try to do either with word or character n-gram.
Using an f1 macro, I don’t get a good f1 score. If I use
character n-grams, it’s not super great but it’s still quite
a lot better than if we look at the words because I don’t
need to learn new digital names.
.tiny-code[
]
We can do a grid search, though that might take a while on
the bigger dataset.
Things that you want to tune are a regularization of your
models, I always use logistic regression CV to tune it
internally. If I want to tune multiple things at once, I
could use as a pipeline grid search.
Here, this is for character n-grams, but still, I might want
to tune the n-gram range. If I was using bag of words, I
might not look at sequences of 8 words because it will take
very long to compute this and it’s probably not going to be
useful.
Here, I’m using count vectorizer, but I could still
normalize using the L2 normalizer.
Another thing, if you do something like this, you don’t want
to fit each step of the pipeline every time. So some of
these steps for the count vectorizer, if you have a big
dataset, it might be pretty expensive and so you don’t want
to refit this again, just because you’re plugged in the
normalizer or just because you changed the C parameter in
the logistic regression.
Make pipeline has a parameter called memory that allows you
to cash the results. So you just have to give it a non-empty
string and it’ll use that as the full name to catch the
results. If there’s no catch eviction, at some point you
need to delete it, or your hard drive will run full.
Here, you can see that after tuning everything, I actually
get a result that’s much better than what I had before. So
before I had an f1 macro of 0.45 and now I have 0.58.
So min_df=2 and ngram_range: (1,5) and c=10 gives the best
results.
Small dataset, makes grid-search faster! (less reliable)
.center[

]
Here, I used pivot tables and Pandas to look into the effect
of the different parameters.
Length of text
Number of out-of-vocabularly words
Presence / frequency of ALL CAPS
Punctuation…!? (somewhat captured by char ngrams)
Sentiment words (good vs bad)
Whatever makes sense for the task!
There are other kinds of features that you might want to
look into.
There are actual collections of positive-negative words that
you can download and you can check how many positive words
are in this, how many negative words are in this. So
basically, the model can share information about how
important these words are because a particularly positive
word might appear only very infrequently in your dataset but
you can still learn that positive word means good.
Bag of words is a pretty good baseline. It’s a very simple
approach and often gives reasonable results.
The last thing I want to mention is how you can scale this
up for really large scale stuff.
Basically just a very slight modification. So for example,
if you want to use training a model on the Twitter stream,
which has tweets coming in all the time, this has a couple
of problems.
You don’t want to store all the data
Your vocabulary might shift over time. You might not be
able to store the whole vocabulary, because the whole
vocabulary of what everybody says on Twitter is very large.
There’s a trick which allows you to get away without
building a vocabulary.
.center[

]
This is what we did before. We tokenize the string, split
onto words, build a vocabulary and then built a sparse
matrix representation. Now we can replace this vocabulary
with just a hash function.
.center[

]
And we can use any string hash function, that computes half
of the token, then we represent this token just by its hash
number.
Here, I used a hash method. This just hashes to 832,412 and
so this is the number of the feature. Then I can use these
as indices into my sparse matrix encoding. So now I need a
hash function with some upper limits, let’s say 1 billion or
something, and as I get a feature vector of length 1
billion. And then I can use these hashes as indices into
this feature vector.
So I don’t need to build a vocabulary which is pretty nice.
.left-column[
Pro:
Fast
Works for streaming data
Low memory footprint
]
.right-column[
Con:
Can’t interpret results
Hard to debug
(collisions are not a problem for model accuracy)
]
Here are pros and cons listed.
It’s hard to interpret the results because now you have like
a feature vector of size million, but you don’t know what
the features correspond to. Previously we had a vocabulary
and we could say feature 3 corresponds to X and now we don’t
know what it is.
You could try to store the correspondences but that would
sort of remove all the benefits. So that makes it kind of
hard to debug.
There can be hash collisions, which make it harder to
interpret. 2 tokens can hash to the same index. In practice,
that’s not really a problem for accuracy. But it’s a problem
for interpretability because you can’t undo the hash
function so you don’t know why your model learned the thing
it learned. But if you have really big text data or
streaming setting, this is a quite simple and effective
method.
.smallest[
Careful: Uses l2 normalization by default!
]
.tiny-code[
]
This is a drop-in replacement for count vectorizer. It’s the
hashing vectorizer. Here, you can see by default, it
actually uses a hash base of about a million.
The result was about the same. It can be faster, and you get
away without storing the vocabulary

Limitations of bag of words:
Semantics of words not captured
Synonymous words not represented
Very distributed representation of documents
One possible reason to do this is that you want to get a
representation of your text data that’s more semantic.
In bag of words, the semantics of the words are not really
captured at all. Synonymous words are not represented, if
you use a synonym it will be like a completely different
feature and will have nothing to do with another feature.
The representation is very distributed, you have hundreds of
thousands of features and it’s kind of hard to reason about
such a long vector sometimes, in particular, if you have
longer documents.
Today, we’re going to talk about classical unsupervised
methods. And next time, we’re going to talk about word
vectors and word embedding, which also tries to solve the
same problem of getting more semantically meaningful
representations for text data.
Next, I want to talk a little bit about models that are
somewhat more specific to the text data, or that allows us
maybe to interpret the text data a little bit more clearly.
The idea of topic models is basically that each document is
created as a mixture of topics. Each topic is a distribution
over words. And we want to learn the topics that are
relevant to our corpus and which of these topics contribute
to each individual document.
Topics could be the genre of movie, or the sentiment, or the
comment writer sophistication, or whether English is their
native language or so on. And so each of them is would be
topics. So the topic is not necessarily sorted of semantic
topic, but something that influences the choice of
vocabulary for a given document.
For each document, you assume that several of these topics
are active and others are not and they have very varying
importance. So movies could be mixtures of different genres
and then they could have words from multiple genres.
Each document is created as a mixture of topics
Topics are distributions over words
Learn topics and composition of documents simultaneously
Unsupervised (and possibly ill-defined)
This is an unsupervised task, so it’s probably ill-defined
and so results are open to interpretation, and also depend
on how exactly you formulate the task.
#Matrix Factorization
.center[

]
So matrix factorization algorithm works like this. We have
our data matrix, X, which is number of samples times number
of features. And we want to factor it into two matrices, A
and B.
A is number of samples times k and B is k times number of
features.
If we do this in some way, we get for each sample, a new
representation in k-dimensional, each row of k will
correspond to one sample and the columns of B will
correspond to the input features. So they encode how the
entries of A correspond to the original data. Often this is
called latent representation. So, these new features here in
A, somehow represent the rows of X and the features are
encoded in B.
#Matrix Factorization
.center[

]
sklearn speak: A = mf.transform(X)
#PCA
.center[

]
The one example of this that we already saw is principal
component analysis. In PCA, B was basically the rotation and
then a projection. And A is just the  projection of X.
This is just one particular factorization you can do. I have
the sign equal, but usually, more generally, you’re trying
to find matrixes A and B so that this is as close to equal
as possible.
In particular, for PCA, what we’re trying to do is we try to
find matrices A and B so that the rows of B are orthogonal,
and we restrict the rank of k. K would be the number of
components and we get PCA, if we restrict the columns of B
to be orthogonal, then the product of matrixes A and B is
most close to X in the least square sense is the principal
component analysis.
Reduce dimensionality of data.
Can’t use PCA: can’t subtract the mean (sparse data)
Instead of PCA: Just do SVD, truncate.
“Semantic” features, dense representation.
Easy to compute - convex optimization
LSA is basically just the same as PCA. The idea is to reduce
the dimensionality of the data to some semantically
meaningful components. The thing is, we can’t easily do PCA
here, because we can’t remove the mean. Remember, this is a
sparse dataset and so the zero is sort of meaningful and if
we shift the zero, like by trying to subtract the mean, we
will get a density dataset that won’t have many zeros
anymore and so we won’t be able to even store it.
There are ways to still compute PCA without explicitly creating
a big dense matrix, but in the traditional LSA, we just
ignore that and do a singular value decomposition of the data.
This is exactly the
same computation as PCA, only, we don’t subtract the mean.
This is very easy to compute. You can do the SVD very
easily. And there’s a unique solution that you can compute.
And then you have something that’s like a dense
representation of the data and hopefully, it’s semantic in
some way.
As with all unsupervised methods, this can be hit or miss a
little bit.
.smaller[
]
So the way to do this with scikit-learn is with truncated
SVD. Truncated SVD is basically the implementation of PCA
that doesn’t subtract the mean. We didn’t call it LSA,
because if you do this in the context of text processing,
you can do this whenever you have a sparse dataset, you
would want to do something like PCA but it’s sparse, then
you can use the truncated SVD.
Here, I’m just using the training set, 25,000 documents, I
removed the stop words, and I set min_df=4.
So basically, I removed the most common words, which are
stop words, and I removed the very infrequent words. So I
have a more reasonably sized vocabulary. And then I did a
truncated SVD and extract 100 components. And so the
components I extracted, are 100 X number of features. So I
have 100 vectors, where each feature corresponds to one of
the words in the vocabulary.
.smaller[

.center[

As we saw with PCA, we can look at the explained variance
ratio.
Here’s is a semi-log scale. And you can see that the first
one or two explain a lot and then rapidly decreases. A lot
is captured in the first 10, and then it goes down.
But still at 100, there’s still a lot of variances left, so
it’ll just probably go down logarithmically as it goes on.
We can also look at the eigenvectors with the highest
singular values.
.center[

]
Here are the 6 first eigenvectors. I’m showing only the
entries that have the largest magnitude, either positive or
negative.
I’m showing the 10 largest magnitudes entries of each of the
eigenvectors. So again, keep in mind that the sign doesn’t
really mean anything, since its eigenvalues, but sort of the
relative sign means something.
So the first one is sort of what you would usually get.
They’re all positive because all entries in the data matrix
are positive since its bag of words. This is sort of, in a
sense, just translating into the middle of the data,
somewhat similar to trying to model the mean. ‘Movie’ and
‘film’ are obviously the most common words.
The second eigenvector is whether someone uses the word
‘movies’ or ‘films’. You can see that either someone uses
‘film’ and ‘films’ or ‘movie’ and ‘movies’. Basically,
people don’t usually use both of them in the same comment.
It is just interesting that this is the one of the largest
components of variances, whether a person uses this one word
or this other word that is completely synonymous.
Points in direction of mean
There are 2 things that you can do, you can normalize for
the length of the document, or you can scale so that all the
features are on the same scale.
MaxAbsScaler performs the same way as a standard scaler,
only it doesn’t subtract the mean. So it just scales
everything to have the same maximum absolute value. And so
in this sense, I’m basically scaling down film and movie to
have the same importance as the
other words. I can also normalize and get rid of the length
of the document. But I don’t think it actually had an effect
here. And then I can compute the same thing.
“Movie” and “Film” were dominating first couple of components. Try to get rid of that effect.
.center[

]
This is the first six eigenvectors of LSA after scaling. The
first one still points towards the direction of the mean. So
I found some components like the third one here, which are
interesting because I interpreted this as like a writer
sophistication. So there are some people that use a lot of
very short words and some people use a lot of very long
words. So people that use words like ‘cinematography’ also
use words like ‘performance’ and ‘excellent’. This also
comes out from some of the other methods.
And so I looked at a couple of these components and it
turned out that the component 1 and the component 3 are
actually related to the good and bad review.
Movie and film still important, but not that dominant any more.

This scatter plot is positive reviews versus negative
reviews. Some of the components actually capture the
semantic attributes we are interested in.
It was completely unsupervised, we didn’t put that in and
this is just a bunch of movie reviews. But these two
components, actually, seem to be pretty related to the
sentiment of the comment writer.
I also run a logistic regression on 10 components and it was
at 83% accuracy.
I thought that was actually pretty good. It was 88% using
the bag of word representation. So you got 88% if you used
30,000 dimensions, and you get 83% if you used 10
dimensions. So it is completely unsupervised compression of
the data. So it’s not as good as the original data set but
if you take 100 components you recover the same accuracy.
So these components definitely capture something that’s
semantic, and it allows us to classify even if we use lower
dimensional representation.
Not competitive but reasonable with just 10 components
.center[

The first model I want to use for this is NMF.
In NMF, remember, we have a data matrix, X, which is now our
large sparse matrix of word counts and we factorize this
into HxW, H is the hidden or latent representation, and W
represents the weights.
Frobenius loss / squared loss (𝑌=𝐻𝑊Y=HW):
Kulback-Leibler (KL) divergence:
$𝑙KL(𝑋,𝑌)=∑𝑖,𝑗𝑋𝑖𝑗log(𝑋𝑖𝑗𝑌𝑖𝑗)−𝑋𝑖𝑗+𝑌𝑖𝑗$lKL(X,Y)=∑i,jXijlog⁡(XijYij)−Xij+Yij$
optimization :
Convex in either W or H, not both.
Randomly initialize (PCA?)
Iteratively update W and H (block coordinate descent)
–
Transforming data:
Given new data X_test, fixed W, computing H requires optimization.
In literature: often everything transposed
You want X to be close to HxW, that’s the whole goal. There
are 2 common ways in which people measure this.
The first one at the top is called x norm, it’s just least
squares basically. So you look at the least squares
difference element-wise between the entries in the X and the
entries in the product, 〖HW〗_ij. This one is the mostly
common used one and also the default in scikit-learn.
The bottom one is the one which was originally proposed,
which is basically, a version of the KDE, which is usually a
measure that finds similarities between distributions. But
here, it’s applied basically to element-wise entries of this
matrix. The authors use that because then they could drive
nice ways to minimize this.
Minimizing either of these is not convex but if you hold one
of the two fixes, then minimizing the other one is convex.
So you usually iterate doing either gradient descent or
coordinate descent on H and then doing it on W, then you’re
iterate between the two.
.center[

]
When applying this to text, the rows of X, corresponds to
movie reviews, the columns of X correspond to words. So that
means the rows of H, correspond to documents, and the
columns of H correspond to the importance of a given topic
for a given document. The rows in W corresponds to topics,
one row in W is lengths of vocabulary that states the words
that are important for a particular topic. So you might have
a component with like horror, scary, monster and so on.
If the first topic is about horror movies, and the first
movie is a horror movie, then it would be a large first
component. Since everything is positive, and so the additive
components are added together. That possibly makes it a
little bit more interpretable.
Each row of W corresponds to one “topic”
.smallest[
]
.center[

]
Sorted by “most active” components
NMF, as I said, is an iterative optimization so this runs
way longer than the LSA.
Q: What’s the variable ’tol’ do?
A: It’s stopping tolerance.
These are subsets of the columns of W. I’m visualizing the
rows of W and I’m only looking at the ones that have large
absolute values. So the Y values are the weight that this
word has inside this topic. So the word ‘really’ has the
weight of 7 in this first topic.
So obviously, they have entries for all words, but I didn’t
put in a penalty so that they’re sparse. So they’ll have
non-zero entries for all words, but sort of the interesting
ones are the big ones.
The way that I picked these 9 components here out of the 100
components was the ones that have the highest activation in
X. I, then realize it might not be the most interesting
thing. Might be more interesting to look at the ones that
are less peaked.
If you look at more components, you’ll find other
genre-specific components.
One of the things you can do with this is you can find
genre specific reviews by looking at the component that
corresponds to it.

I did the same thing without scaling.

You can also run this on TF-IDF. Again, results are somewhat
similar to before. The top-ranked components are now
different. It really only makes sense if you look at all 100
components, but it’s very hard to do. So I picked out just a
couple.
This was with a 100 components. That said, if you use fewer
components, you get something that is much more general.
.center[

]
This is using 9 components. The first one, probably kind of
models the mean and points in the center.
Q: is the task here still to classify between good and bad
reviews?
The application of that I had in the back of my head is I’m
interested in the reviews, good or bad, but this is all
completely unsupervised. So I never put in anything about
these two classes even existing. This is just trying to help
me understand corpus overall.
The main things that I found so far are that it finds things
that are genre specific, some of them are very specific,
like Star Wars and DC comics, some of them are less specific
like horror movies, but then it finds some that are about
sentiments.
The reason why I call these topics is since they are
additive. And so maybe someone would argue that this is not
really a topic model, because it’s not technically a topic
perfect model but it does exactly the same as a topic model
does. It does a positive decomposition. I think that’s
easier to interpret in this context. Because what does it
mean for a document to be not about horror movies.
Less number of components will give you more generic things.
If you use more number of components, there might be generic
components. If you want to force them to be generic, you can
use fewer components. Using fewer components definitely
makes it easy to look at them.
A friend of mine who is an expert on topic models told me to
always use thousands of components, and then go through all
of them and see if something’s interesting.
#Latent Dirichlet Allocation
(Not Linear Discriminant Analysis)
Next thing I want to talk about is LDA. We are going from
simple models to more complex model.
What people think about if they hear topic model is usually
LDA. Dave Blei in the sets department invented LDA. This is
like an incredibly popular model right now.
.center[

]
.smallest[
(stolen from Dave and John)
]
This a probabilistic generative model. The idea is you write
down a generative process of how each document is created.
This is similar to mixture models where basically, for each
point you want to create, you picked one of the Gaussians
and then you sample from it. That’s how we create points in
this distribution.
Similarly, in the LDA model, let’s say, you’re given some
topics and these topics have, like word importance. Given
the topics, the way that you generate a document would be,
first, you draw which of these topics are important, and how
important are they?
Each document is a mixture of topics and then for each word,
you decide which of these topics to you want to draw a word
from. And then you draw a word from that topic, according to
the word importance.
This is clearly not really how text is generated but it’s
sort of reasonable proxy. This is based on the bag of word
model so it only looks at word counts. It doesn’t do that
context at all. You could do it on bigrams, but that’s not
what people usually do.
The idea is how likely is it that a word appears in this
document and basically, for each word individually, you pick
a topic, and then you generate a word from this topic and in
the end, you end up with a big bag of word representation.
The idea is that this a generative process, given corpus of
documents, can I actually do inference in this? Can I find
out what were the topics that generated this model? And what
are the topic proportions for each of the documents? And
what are the word assignments?
So basically, you write down this generative process and
then given your documents, you’re trying to invert it and
figure out what were the topics.

You can write down this generative model in flight
notations. I don’t think we looked at the plate notation yet
because I don’t find it very helpful.
So this is a depiction of the graphical model where
basically, each of these circles is a variable. And these
red things are called plates and they mean a variable is
duplicated.
So here, there are 2 parameters you specified beforehand,
which are the hyperparameters, Alpha and Beta.
Then there are K topics, I fixed the number of topics and I
call them K. And for each topic, I have a distribution over
words, like how important is each word in each topic. Then D
goes over documents. So for each document, I have a
distribution over the topics that states that a particular
document is so much about this topic, and so much about
another topic.
So for each document, I have a vector that tells me the
topic proportions. Finally, inside the document, for each
word I have a variable, that tells me which topic the word
belongs to and then given the topic, what is the word.
Here, this outer plate is replicated along all the documents
and then inside each document, for each word, there’s the
inner plate.
But the only thing that I actually observe is basically the
W, which is the word count. So I observed which words
appeared in these documents. I also set alpha and beta as
some prior parameters usually.
What I want to find out is the topic distribution over words
and the documents specific distributions over topics. So I
want to know what the topics are and what topics are a given
document about.
This is very similar to the thing that we had in NMF.
The flight notation graph can be read as
A) The generative process or
B) Dependency structure in the probability distribution.
So basically, the distribution that you can easily think of
is like, what should the work distribution be? And so the
word, I choose it from a discreet of distribution, like
given a particular topic, I take the distribution of words
in this topic and I pick from that distribution.
So this is a categorical distribution where you say, under
this distribution, each word is so and so likely. So this
multinomial distribution, this is how I pick a word given a
topic.
But the distribution in this is Dirichlet data
distributions.
Basically, you want the distribution over distribution, you
want the distribution where the outcome is multinomial
distribution, and for the W, I want multinomial
distributions and so the pi, the outcome of drawing there,
needs to be multinomial distribution.
The national prior over things that give me multinomial
distributions is called Dirichlet.
K topics = multinomial distributions over words
“mixture weights” for each document:
How important is each topic for this document
Each document contains multiple topics!
.smaller[It models the probability of counts for rolling a k-sided die n times.]
.quote_author[wikipedia]
–
if 𝑝(𝑥|𝜃)p(x|θ) is multimnomial (discrete distribution),
then 𝑝(𝜃)=Dirichlet(...)p(θ)=Dirichlet(...) is a conjugate prior.
This is how it looks in formula. For multinomial, let’s say
I draw n words from a multinomial. There are k possible
words, I draw n, so I draw the same word multiple times, and
the probability of drawing a particular word is P1 to Pk. So
then the probability of a specific draw is P1 to X1, and so
on from Pk to the Xk and then normalized.
Dirichlet is basically the same, only the other way around.
You can see that here, the Ps in multicultural distribution
become the Xs in Dirichlet distribution. Dirichlet looks
exactly the same. Only now, you have a distribution over
these base probabilities.
That makes it very easy to include the data into the prior
information and compute the posterior.
Prior is called “conjugate” of the posterior has the same form as prior
$𝑃(𝜃|𝑥)=𝑝(𝑥|𝜃)𝑝(𝜃)∫𝑝(𝑥|𝜃′)𝑝(𝜃′)𝑑𝜃′$$P(θ|x)=p(x|θ)p(θ)∫p(x|θ′)p(θ′)dθ′$
The reason why we’re using generative prior is because of
the conjugate prior of the multinomial distribution.  Let’s
say we have a prior over our word topic distribution and
then we observe some words belonging to some of the topics,
we have some evidence that these words are drawn from these
topics and then we want to update our word topic prior,
given the information that we saw.
p(x|θ) would be our multinomial distribution, meaning given
the topic, what are the multinomial distribution. And
basically, we want p(θ|x) to be easy to compute. And it’s
easiest to compute if we use the conjugate prior here,
because then posterior will have the same distribution as
the prior.

Here are some examples in 3D. Dirichlet distribution is like
a distribution over distributions. So a point drawn from
Dirichlet distribution is a multinomial distribution.
So here, let’s say you have a multinomial with 3 variables,
this lives inside the probability simplex in 3-dimensions.
The dark blue sector is sort of the space all 3 numbers that
sum up to one.
And so now you can try put a prior on this. So we want to
distribution over the simplex of all 3 numbers that add up
to 1. And so what we’re doing for LDA is usually, we make
this sort of symmetric in all directions because we don’t
really have a preference for like, saying one topic is more
important than the other topic, that’s not our prior
knowledge, because they are arbitrary.
It’s pretty likely that all the topics are equally
important, that means I have put math only in the very
center or I can say, I didn’t really know how important each
of the topics is, and then you can get points at the
corners, which means that each document can be about only a
few topics. If you use this, then each document will be
about many topics.
And similarly, these priors use both on the document topic
distribution, and on the topic word distribution. So
similarly, for each topic, you can have each topic being
very broad.
So the third one means broad, you assign probability mass to
most words.  While the first one means you can assign
probability mass only to a couple of the words.

Variational Inference
Extension of expectation-maximization algorithm

Less accurate solutions
Championed by Dave Blei
]
There’s basically 2 schools of thought on how we can best
solve this. These are ways to do inference and generalize
the models.
Gibbs sampling is a form of MCMC, so it’s like a stochastic
simulation. Basically, you simulate process going on for a
long time, you keep sampling and in the end, you get as a
stationary distribution, the real distribution that you’re
interested in.  This is very accurate. You can do this for
any probabilistic model. But it’s very slow because you need
to simulate the process of generating the data for a long
until it lines up with what’s in the data. Gibbs sampling a
form of sampling so it’s like a very random process.
The other one is variational inference. This is more from an
optimization perspective. This is very similar to the
expectation-maximization algorithm that’s used for GMMs,
which is similar to that of the KMeans idea of alternating
between assignment and maximization. This is a deterministic
algorithm, it’s quite a bit faster than Gibbs sampling
usually, but less accurate. The way that it does
approximations is not entirely clear. This is used by Dave
Blei all the time.
“Small data” (
<
= 10k? Documents):
Gibbs sampling (lda package, MALLET in Java)
“Medium data” (

Variational Inference (scikit-learn default)
“Large Data” (>1M? Documents):
Stochastic Variational Inference
SVI allows online learning (partial_fit)
Tensorflow Probability https://www.tensorflow.org/probability
Tensor-flow based framework for stochastic variational inference.
Used to be Edward by Dustin Tran (Blei Lab)
Pick a solver depending on the amount of the documents you
have.
Ida package (Python) and MALLET (Java) works well if you
have very few documents. Otherwise, it gets too slow.
Variational inference or batch variational inference, which
will be the default in scikit-learn in the future. Both are
used on medium sized documents.
For large data, you can do stochastic variation inference,
which is the current default in scikit-learn. But that’s
sort of an approximation to the approximation. It’s
something like doing stochastic gradient descent on the
optimization variational inference.
Partial_fit can be used on streaming data.
If you’re more serious about this, look at the works of
Dustin Tran. He created Edward, I think it’s now
incorporated into TensorFlow. It’s a library for doing
variational inference in all kinds of different graphical
models with GPU acceleration.
Talking about SGD, maybe it’s good if have a lot of data,
maybe it’s worth doing an approximation that allows you to
use all the data, if the other option is to do something
that’s fairly exact, but you have to subsample your data a
lot, then that might give you worse results than just doing
something that’s pretty bad.
SVI is maybe not the greatest optimizer but it allows you to
use large amounts of data, and so in the end to get a better
result.
Variational might be more sensitive to hyper parameters? Or give different results?

Implementing in scikit-learn is pretty straightforward. The
components are not ordered, and changing number of
components changes everything. Here, I do
learning_method=batch and the other one is
learning_method=online, but since the dataset is not that
big, it’ll just give me sort of worse results.
Everything is positive because these are now the word topic
matrices. It tells me if I picked this topic, what’s the
probability of each of these words and they’re actually on a
log scale. They sum up to 1 in a sense. This is using 10
topics, so this is pretty generic.
Very generic, similar to NMF(n_components=10).

Here, I picked out a couple of topics that I thought were
interesting.
One thing that you can do is try to interpret this. You can
use both this and NMF as a representation for
classification, for example. There’s no guarantee that it’s
a good representation, but it might be a better
representation than the bag of words.
If you do the NMF with 100 components, you actually get a
slightly better result than if you use just a bag of word
vectors. Doing the NMF actually helps you to get some
features that are semantic for the task of classifying good
versus bad reviews.

Start from random initialization (𝑥01,...,𝑥0𝑛)(x10,...,xn0)
Construct 𝑥𝑘+1xk+1 from 𝑥𝑘xk:

This is sort of the generative process of the data. And so
what Gibbs sampling does is, we observe the words W and we
are given the priors, alpha, and beta, so now we want to
figure out the word topic indicators and the documents
specific distribution over topics and topic distribution
over words.
The way that Gibbs sampling works is it basically assigns
these randomly and then draws the posterior distribution for
each of these variables, given all the other variables.
So if we know all the words and the topic assignments of the
words, then we can look at what’s the distribution of the
topics over words likely to be.
If we know alpha, we know all the topic distributions for
each document then we can also compute the document specific
distributions over topics. So basically, if you know all the
information that’s connected to give node, you can draw this
given node, given all the other information.
And then you just iterate these.
I’m not sure how to phrase this…given all the other
variables, you can randomly draw one of the variables and
then fix these and randomly draw the other variables. And
this gives you sort of a mark of change, meaning that every
time you draw this, the distribution over the other things
will change. And if you keep drawing and keep drawing, in
the end, you will get to a distribution, which is sort of
the correct posterior. Which just means it’s going to be the
most likely assignment of topics, given to documents.
If you do this, if you fix the document specific
distribution over topics and if you fix the topic
distribution over works, then all of the documents become
independent, because everything that you need to know about
one document is already covered in the documents specific
distribution over topics and the other documents don’t
really matter.
If you do it this way, you can easily paralyze it over
documents, for example.

Updates sampled from:
𝑝(𝑧𝑖𝑣=𝑘|𝜃𝑖,𝜙𝑘)∝exp(log𝜃𝑖𝑘+log𝜙𝑘,𝑦𝑖𝑣)p(ziv=k|θi,ϕk)∝exp⁡(log⁡θik+log⁡ϕk,yiv)
𝑝(𝜃𝑖|𝑧𝑖𝑣=𝑘,𝜙𝑘)=Dir(𝛼+∑𝑙𝕀(𝑧𝑖𝑙=𝑘))p(θi|ziv=k,ϕk)=Dir(α+∑lI(zil=k))
𝑝(𝜙𝑘|𝑧𝑖𝑣=𝑘,𝜃𝑖)=Dir(𝛽+∑𝑖∑𝑙𝕀(𝑦𝑖𝑙=𝑣,𝑧𝑖𝑙=𝑘))p(ϕk|ziv=k,θi)=Dir(β+∑i∑lI(yil=v,zil=k))
i is index for documents, v is index for words in document, k index for topics.
z is word-topic assignments.
𝑧𝑖𝑣=𝑘ziv=k means word v in document i is assigned topic k.
𝜃θ is document topic distribution, 𝜃𝑖𝑘θik is the probability of a word in document i to come from topic k.
𝑦𝑖𝑣yiv is the actual word (word-index) of word v in document i.
𝜙𝑘,𝑦ϕk,y is the probability of a drawing word y from document k.
𝜙𝑘,𝑦𝑖𝑣ϕk,yiv is the probability

Sample only 𝑝(𝑧𝑖=𝑘|𝐳−𝑖)p(zi=k|z−i)
Compute 𝜃θ, 𝜙ϕ from 𝐳z
If you don’t want to paralyze it, you can reformulate Gibbs
sampling into collapsed Gibbs sampling, where we only look
at the topic so we can analytically compute away π and theta
and we can look only at z, which is the topic assignments
for each word. And we can only draw the Zs for each word, in
order for each word we draw which topic this word comes
from.
The problem with this is if we integrate this and this (the
smallest and the largest red rectangle) then all of the
different words will be dependent. So we can’t do this in
parallel anymore, we have to go word by word and for each
word we draw, what’s the probability of this word belonging
to this topic given all the other word assignments.
This makes the math a little bit easier, but it means it’s
going to be sequential. Once we computed all these word
topic assignments we can then get the topic distribution
over words and the documents specific distribution over
topics (once we have all the z_is)
Now looking at all documents together (i goes over words and documents).
𝑧−𝑖z−i is word-topic assignments for all other words for all documents.
Now sequential problem!
Rethinking LDA: Why Priors Matter - Hanna Wallach
LDA Revisited: Entropy, Prior and Convergence –
Zhang et. al.
If you want to learn more about this, in particular, about
the practical aspects of this, there are 2 papers that I
really recommend.
Both of these talk more about how to use LDA in practice and
how to tune hyperparameters and so on.
One thing I want to say is that the hyperparameters behave
actually quite different for the variational inference and
the Gibbs sampling. I think the first paper uses Gibbs
sampling, and the second uses inference. Things are very
different between these two approaches, even though you’re
trying to optimize the same probabilistic model.
